 CapybaraEater#5386: But like they don't check electronic devices by taking them out the case
 Coloursplash#9680: they do check hold luggage you just don‚Äôt see it
 CapybaraEater#5386: So literally do they just not think someone could use that 80kg to make a bomb connected to Bluetooth which would not be checked or like do they think the person gets to the luggage drop-off, sees the sign for no explosives and just goes ah shit better not bring this bomb its forbidden
 CapybaraEater#5386: Like they'll check hand luggage with extreme care, but they don't give a shit about hold luggage and you get 80kg
 CapybaraEater#5386: I love how airports pretend that remote control bombs don't exist

 Obsidian360#0930: it's a *hobby*
 Jakwok#9307: no you spend hours on videos and make nothing
 Obsidian360#0930: ok but do you walk on paper and sell it for ¬£1.3 million? didn't think so
 Jakwok#9307: you play hypixel
 ron0studios#4591: the thing is if you pay attention during lessons atleast a bit then you'll probably do fine with revising really late

 Anonimouse#7272: imm get a 9 in my transgender gcse ü•∫
 Alison40#7268: because if you don't you end up perpetuating the "gender is a social construct" bs
 Alison40#7268: we need to actually educate teachers correctly about this stuff
 Coloursplash#9680: also ‚Äúteach transgender‚Äù like it‚Äôs a school subject

 CapybaraEater#5386: And then epic games is just sandwiched Into the middle pretending to be useful
 CapybaraEater#5386: Why do origin and EA hate each other???

 Junglle#0896: nah ur just gonna get the shits
 CapybaraEater#5386: in the past two days i have eaten two packs of tictacs, one pack of polos and a pack of migit gems, i swear to god i am going to get diabetes

 Obsidian360#0930: unfortunately i can't combo like huzuni and absolutely loath shorts
 ron0studios#4591: i guess Ill start doing daily uploads over the summer lol
 ron0studios#4591: that growth is insane though
 ron0studios#4591: IMO there's a plateau where quality doesn't lead to more growth, and its pretty low, and then growth stagnates until it increases really quickly again once you start pouring in production level quality like mr beast
 Junglle#0896: watch the whole video
 Anonimouse#7272: yeah
 ron0studios#4591: thanks jarvis
 ron0studios#4591: jarvis find the identity of

 ron0studios#4591: oh god its recursive
 ron0studios#4591: what would happen if I did that
 ron0studios#4591:  what was that
 BADGER#7138: roblox jumpscare
 ron0studios#4591: so without headphones its basically just the high end and nothing else
 ron0studios#4591: bcs I haven't actually mixed it properly yet
 exorax#9275: alr sure
 ron0studios#4591: if you can listen with headphones or smth
 ron0studios#4591: ok yh itd be better if you wait to get on pc
 exorax#9275: uh cant listen to mp3 on mobile either post it somehwere or wait a bit for me to get on pc
 ron0studios#4591: so basically undertale + rhythm based
 ron0studios#4591: like undertale vibes
 ron0studios#4591: and gamey at the same time
 ron0studios#4591: its supposed to be rhythm based
 ron0studios#4591:  i made game song
 BADGER#7138: you have balls
 exorax#9275: what is it
 exorax#9275: i got pinged yeah
 ron0studios#4591: probably david

 ron0studios#4591: ok
 Coloursplash#9680: ask 
 Coloursplash#9680: no, sorry
 ron0studios#4591: do you have any ideas on what I should do?
 ron0studios#4591: ah
 Coloursplash#9680: megalovania layers so many different sounds over each other, thats where the complexity comes from
 ron0studios#4591: oh
 Coloursplash#9680: it is no where near as complex as megalovania
 ron0studios#4591: but its a rhythm based game, so a bit of complexity is needed, i.e having harder hitting drums and a fancier lead
 ron0studios#4591: which the song already is tbh
 ron0studios#4591: basically anything more complex than megalovania is a no go
 BADGER#7138: try to use sandpaper
 ron0studios#4591: without making it not a video gamey song
 ron0studios#4591: how do i make it more polished though? in what way?
 ron0studios#4591: *lets take this to the dms....*
 BADGER#7138: dm me
 BADGER#7138: ummmmmm
 BADGER#7138: go queen
 Coloursplash#9680: doggy style tonight?
 Coloursplash#9680: luv u babe
 BADGER#7138: yw
 ron0studios#4591: nice thanks üëç
 Coloursplash#9680:  you need to make it more polished and make the chorus more catchy
also the opening is rushed and needs breaks between the notes
 ron0studios#4591: yh I got confused
 BADGER#7138: wtf are you on about
 ron0studios#4591: wait they're including our predicted grades in our actual grades?
 I'm tired#3188: they dont care that i might have gotten a 8 in bio instead of a 9
 I'm tired#3188: my irgs are close enough
 Anonimouse#7272: or 2020 if u wanna try and flex
 Anonimouse#7272: yeah but use 2019 boundaries
 I'm tired#3188: not grades
 I'm tired#3188: right?
 I'm tired#3188: we just got percentages though
 CapybaraEater#5386: Use the mocks or smth
 Anonimouse#7272: mocks
 I'm tired#3188: do we just use our last irgs?
 I'm tired#3188: also for predicted grades
 CapybaraEater#5386:  wait for me power came back
 I'm tired#3188: but still they should probably be separate categories
 CapybaraEater#5386: That's for diversity hire
 Anonimouse#7272: yea
 Junglle#0896: put fey / fere pronouns
 I'm tired#3188: doesnt seem very relevant
 I'm tired#3188: idk why they care about religion and sexuality for a part time worker in wilkinsons
 I'm tired#3188: i thought it was meant to be like " i want to be known as a cool person" or something like that
 I'm tired#3188: thats so misleading
 I'm tired#3188: why is the text box so big

 CapybaraEater#5386: Just casually carrying this through Chelmsford bus station

 Alison40#7268: i literally invented it lmao
 ron0studios#4591: i swr   you were on capitalcraft right?
 Anonimouse#7272: ruben data.exe

 CapybaraEater#5386:  if you make a saxons thing can you send it? Since I have DT I won't have as much time so it'd be easier, otherwise I can spend 5 minutes and make one and send it to you later
 Alison40#7268: yes..
 Coloursplash#9680:  do you have minecraft?
 Coloursplash#9680:  siege
 ron0studios#4591: when was alison renamed lmao
 Anonimouse#7272: 
 ron0studios#4591: we greatly overestimate the intelligence of UK students
 ron0studios#4591: there were 2 people arguing that this was the right answer
 ron0studios#4591: the lovely community of the student room
 exorax#9275: who?
 exorax#9275: LMAO
 ron0studios#4591: someone put on the echidna question that being cold will reduce them from being detected from infrared
 CapybaraEater#5386: no we got told that
 Obsidian360#0930: we've been lied to
 CapybaraEater#5386: exactly but insulin is needed too
 Obsidian360#0930: so yeah it's your classic ambiguous aqa exam paper
 exorax#9275: but the point is it's a different type of "treatment"
 Obsidian360#0930: diet also treats but doesn't cure
 exorax#9275: well yeah
 CapybaraEater#5386: which wouldn't really help you
 Obsidian360#0930: insulin only treats it though, it doesn't cure it
 CapybaraEater#5386: but it needs both else you'll need an absolute TON of insulin
 CapybaraEater#5386: cus you need an absolute ton of insulin
 exorax#9275: whereas the insulin is like fixing the problem itself
 CapybaraEater#5386: well no but if you don't diet and you just do insulin you do die usually
 exorax#9275: it's just preventing you from dying
 exorax#9275: bc the diet isn't doing anything to actually fix the diabetes there
 CapybaraEater#5386: what's wrong with it?
 exorax#9275: yeah we were talking abt the type 1 box
 CapybaraEater#5386: wheras 1 is both to limit the need for insulin and glucagon
 CapybaraEater#5386: i thought you were too cus it's talking about 2 when it says the diet thing
 CapybaraEater#5386: not 1
 CapybaraEater#5386: oh right yh i'm talking about 2
 exorax#9275: type 1 is the mostly genetic one
 exorax#9275: that's type 2
 exorax#9275: no
 CapybaraEater#5386: isn't it that if they keep their diet regularly it slowly goes back to usual?
 exorax#9275: you don't just suddenly not have type 1
 exorax#9275: well the diet doesn't
 CapybaraEater#5386: plus it does eventually fix it
 exorax#9275: lmao
 Junglle#0896: also i thought it was alex typing lmao
 Junglle#0896: yeah
 exorax#9275: so i see where they're coming from
 exorax#9275: i think it's a little weird on wording since attention to diet doesn't like treat type 1, but it does mean you don't fucking die
 CapybaraEater#5386: in one year
 CapybaraEater#5386: like during covid a person who was originally on 30k a year from pension would have risen to 34k roughly a year
 CapybaraEater#5386: literally it's insane
 Anonimouse#7272: ah
 CapybaraEater#5386: pension funds will rise by the larger of these three:
5%
the job wage inflation 
or normal inflation
 Anonimouse#7272: whats a triple lock again
 CapybaraEater#5386: which it can
 CapybaraEater#5386: you know the triple lock is insane if it can support people only eating m&s every day
 CapybaraEater#5386: yup
 Anonimouse#7272: also expensive
 ron0studios#4591: its great
 ron0studios#4591: I can recommend m&s food
 CapybaraEater#5386: like sure food is cool but i live for the rush of passionate emotions as i scan the bar code and hear the utterly erotic "beep" and know i have chosen to follow my daddy capitalism and spend money to obtain a material good which i will then ecstatically use very little of
 Anonimouse#7272: true true

 ron0studios#4591: sin x / BD = sin y / AB
AB / BD = sin y / sin x
sin x / DC = sin  / AC
sin y = sin  due to sine law
sin x / DC = sin y / AC
AC / DC = sin y / sin x = AB / BD

 I'm tired#3188: ah got it
 Coloursplash#9680: and yea I have typed these out on mobile I hate myself
 Coloursplash#9680: Do a simultaneous equation with two of those and it will cancel down to AB/BD = AC/DC
 Coloursplash#9680: BD/sinx = AD/sinABC
BD = ADsinx/sinABC
BC/sin2x = AC/sinABC
BC = ACsin2x/sinABC
DC = ACsin2x/sinABC - ADsinx/sinABC
idk probably can do it with those
 Coloursplash#9680: x = ky^2
y = jz^3
substitute in for
x = k^2 = kjz^6
32 = kj * 2^6
rearrange for
kj = 32 / 64 = 0.5
x = 0.5z^6

 ron0studios#4591: i like the bricks for some reason
 ron0studios#4591: thats a pretty nice picture
 CapybaraEater#5386: Just like a section along the farmers field where the river runs
 CapybaraEater#5386: So nothing huge
 CapybaraEater#5386: And the deer love it
 CapybaraEater#5386: But yes
 CapybaraEater#5386: It's pretty small
 CapybaraEater#5386: I mean
 I'm tired#3188: You have a forest???
 CapybaraEater#5386: Everyone always goes "oh how wonderful to have deer in your garden". No. They just scream and eat all the non yellow flowers
 CapybaraEater#5386: All I know is that I'd rather it didn't
 CapybaraEater#5386: But I'm not sure
 CapybaraEater#5386: I'm trying to identify it but I don't think the bird websites understand it isn't singing, it's just yelling
 CapybaraEater#5386: It genuinely sounds like something out of a horror movie
 CapybaraEater#5386: There's a bird in our forest tonight screaming loudly and it is terrifying as fuck
 CapybaraEater#5386: I can take 4 slugs but that amount is insane
 CapybaraEater#5386: Ah that's not too good

 Coloursplash#9680: it‚Äôs not like COD where you get one kill every 30-60 seconds
 Anonimouse#7272: *just say yes so i can make fun of you over tarkov*
 Coloursplash#9680: also there are so many AIs that you can just go on a slaughtering rampage

 Coloursplash#9680: it was really difficult to see them
 Coloursplash#9680: you didnt tho lol
 CapybaraEater#5386: and once they died their body would be stuck there, so now you just end up with a pile of tanks blocking any more tanks going anywhere
 CapybaraEater#5386: except they had no mobility
 CapybaraEater#5386: the tanks were ok
 CapybaraEater#5386: that being said
 CapybaraEater#5386: you had to look away from the enemy to see where they were
 CapybaraEater#5386: yup but even on long range rifles

 cheeselover1973#8426: WGAT GHT FUCK
 cheeselover1973#8426: SLUG?
 exorax#9275: "hello i would like a slug of flour"
 CapybaraEater#5386: In case I need it
 CapybaraEater#5386: Can you save that
 cheeselover1973#8426: erase it from history
 cheeselover1973#8426: can we just launch the us into space
 cheeselover1973#8426: fun
 CapybaraEater#5386: Jesus whyyyy
 exorax#9275: oh wtf the us volume system has a different fluid ounce to the 'correct' imperial system
 CapybaraEater#5386: Why was I born
 cheeselover1973#8426: a teaspoon is 1000000000000000000000000 coffee spoons
 exorax#9275: which is about 5ml
 cheeselover1973#8426: i dont think so
 cheeselover1973#8426: nah
 Anonimouse#7272: thats literally bigger
 cheeselover1973#8426: what about a coffee spoon?
 exorax#9275: that is not a joke
 exorax#9275: fun fact: the smallest imperial unit of volume is a teaspoon
 cheeselover1973#8426: inches>onches>unches
 cheeselover1973#8426: onches
 Anonimouse#7272: im not even joking
 Anonimouse#7272: u have to do tiny standard form of inches
 exorax#9275: oh true
 Anonimouse#7272: oh yeah theres no mili for imp units
 CapybaraEater#5386: That's an awfully imperial sentence you have there, you better not be a communist.
 exorax#9275: actually that's 2 millipints
 cheeselover1973#8426: "he's dying! we need 2x10^-1000 pints of weed or else he'll die"
 exorax#9275: yeah but there's no point complaining to them
 CapybaraEater#5386: So either way it works
 CapybaraEater#5386: Well the youngest one won't know imperial
 exorax#9275: the youngest ones probably don't want imperial anyway
 exorax#9275: no find the oldest one bc they won't know the metric system and it'll be funnier
 CapybaraEater#5386: I have it built into my calculator
 Anonimouse#7272: ahat in the balls is a furlong
 Anonimouse#7272: LMAO
 cheeselover1973#8426: imagine being in a hospital and instead of saying 20ccs of a drug they say 2x10^-1000 pints
 CapybaraEater#5386: I'm tempted to walk into a store, find the youngest attendant then ask them conversion rates.
 exorax#9275: but like seriously all this is gonna do is increase how much mobile data everyone uses bc they have to get their phone out every time they want to buy a quantity of thing that they don't already know
 CapybaraEater#5386: Don't tempt me David.
 exorax#9275: me omw to measure density in stone per furlong-yard-inch
 CapybaraEater#5386: Genuinely if someone asks me about using imperial in a store I will refuse and ask for a conversion into hides.
 CapybaraEater#5386: See this is the stuff we're going to have to deal with now
 CapybaraEater#5386: I want 1x10^-200 hides of milk
 exorax#9275: i'm sure you all know how much a cubic foot is so i will not translate any further
 CapybaraEater#5386: Measure it in hides.
 exorax#9275: =43560 cubic feet
 Anonimouse#7272: david thats a lotta milk
 exorax#9275: a volume of an acre by a foot
 exorax#9275: i am going to measure my milk in acre-feet
 CapybaraEater#5386: You cannot stop me
 CapybaraEater#5386: That's how I'm measuring liquid
 Anonimouse#7272: LMAO
 Anonimouse#7272: INCHES CUBED
 Anonimouse#7272: try: any member of the modern world
 CapybaraEater#5386: I'm using metric or inches cubed
 Anonimouse#7272: texas uses imperial
 CapybaraEater#5386: At the risk of sounding like a texan priest, I refuse to use that hippy liquid system
 exorax#9275: hopefully boris johnson but i'll settle for a random civilian
 exorax#9275: istg if i ever see a label measuring something in fluid ounces i am going to kill someone
 cheeselover1973#8426: im finna buy my milk by the ounce
 Coloursplash#9680: also pints is the norm for milk and alcohol
 Coloursplash#9680: ounces is weight lol
 Coloursplash#9680:  you buy orange juice in pints not ounces
 Anonimouse#7272: back in my day shit made less sense and now you guys have to deal with it too!
 CapybaraEater#5386: _when I was your age I'd spend four hours in the store crying trying to work out how much I'm actually getting_
 BADGER#7138: And stay in power
 BADGER#7138: So he brings back some boomer shit from the 1390s to try to please them
 BADGER#7138: Boris is fucked if he loses their support
 BADGER#7138: Most voters are boomers who are old
 CapybaraEater#5386: Literally the only good thing about jubilees
 CapybaraEater#5386: What's even worse is they're not going to bring back the sugar puff jubilee edition
 CapybaraEater#5386: We're going to get values like 7.6075947 Oz^3
 CapybaraEater#5386: How many inches cubed is this orange juice
 CapybaraEater#5386: Nobody goes to the shops and goes ah fuck I can't buy my orange juice in an obscure measurement that means absolutely nothing and doesn't help me in any way.
 Anonimouse#7272: boris is a cunt
 CapybaraEater#5386: We do not need this
 CapybaraEater#5386: Just why
 CapybaraEater#5386: Literally why
 CapybaraEater#5386: Jesus whyyyy
 Anonimouse#7272: it literally is

 Anonimouse#7272: uh are you sure its a weekend
 Obsidian360#0930: what the fuck
 Coloursplash#9680: for the funny
 Coloursplash#9680:   shops can sell stuff in pounds and ounces for one weekend
 Obsidian360#0930: i think thats what one tends to use a measurement system for
 Obsidian360#0930: measuring stuff
 I'm tired#3188: What would they use imperial for????
 I'm tired#3188: For what?
 I'm tired#3188: No way they are going to use imperial

 Obsidian360#0930: do a capybara and call it an otter
 CapybaraEater#5386: This is less of a request and more of an angry demand
 CapybaraEater#5386:  in the list of animals that are required, could i instead do a capybara
 Anonimouse#7272: L

 CapybaraEater#5386: (for context for normies, there was a question that basically asked the same thing 4 times but with a slight change and the answer was the same each time but they wanted to make you question it by giving loads of irrelevant values and subtly saying it's different)
 CapybaraEater#5386: Like that wasn't a test of knowledge, that was a test of will and self belief
 CapybaraEater#5386: That zener diode question was literally built to gaslight people
 CapybaraEater#5386: That's what I did in the mock

 CapybaraEater#5386: autocracy is my fav

 Anonimouse#7272: whos page is that LOL
 BADGER#7138: get morbed
 Coloursplash#9680: is morbius the new rick and morty?
 I'm tired#3188: pal????
 BADGER#7138: To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Morbius. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Morbius‚Äôs nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Vampire literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Morbius truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Morbius‚Äôs existential catchphrase "I am Morbius," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev‚Äôs Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Daniel Espinosa‚Äôs genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. üòÇ
And yes, by the way, i DO have a Morbius tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 morbIQ points of my own  beforehand. Nothin personnel kid üòé
 Obsidian360#0930: fuck those words

 CapybaraEater#5386: what
 I'm tired#3188: bruh
 CapybaraEater#5386: English playwrights set their tragedies in Italy for several reasons
-    Dramatic device ‚Äì Italy was associated with decadence, corruption, drama- heightened dramatic effect
-    Catholicism ‚Äì makes the lovers even more rebellious ‚Äì engage in blasphemous language, sin ‚Äì suicide, Catholicism ‚Äì positions family as ultimate loyalty, idolatry -
-    Corruption ‚Äì excessive violence in Italian backdrop
-    Sonnet- contextual poetry forms + their significance- 14 lines > sonnets traditionally about love ‚Äì originated from Italy ‚Äì however the prologue sonnet is ironic as it centres hate and death / love sonnet as reflective of Petrarchan love sonnets ‚Äì subverts Petrarchan love poetry as both genders speak and have equal length of lines showing male/female equality
-    Gender stereotypes ‚Äì period ‚Äì Juliet subverts gender stereotypes ‚Äì weapon, rebellion against her father, declaration of love, lying, decision making ‚Äì defying marriage market whereby fathers would choose daughters suitors
-    Astrological references ‚Äì context ‚Äì strong belief in astrological readings and fate
-    Gender stereotypes ‚Äì masculinity ‚Äì hypermasculinity of Tybalt which Mercutio mocks
-    Replacement paternal / maternal figures ‚Äì upper-class children raised often by others
-    Social critique of the upper-class who lack civility ‚Äì irony
-    Do the characters speak in verse or prose? If they speak in verse ‚Äì indicates higher class/ control
-    Nurse as stock character ‚Äì comic relief in tragedy
-    Context of tragic hero/heroine ‚Äì hamartia, peripetia‚Ä¶..
-    Compressed timeframe ‚Äì adds tension and urgency reflecting Greek tragedies
-    Context of bigamy as a sin
-    Religious references
-    Use of protagonist/ antagonist in tragedy
-    Social class-
Italian context
Roman Catholic context
Medieval context
Vs
English context
Protestant context

 CapybaraEater#5386: I take history?
 CapybaraEater#5386: I only know it because it's a great insult to say someone would work there
 Obsidian360#0930: the things geography does to a man

 ron0studios#4591: how have the game developers not fixed stuff like this
 ron0studios#4591: oh thats cool
 ron0studios#4591: have you seen the one where they break the game by playing for a ridiculously high amount of time and break the 32/64 bit limit
 Junglle#0896: it glitches and the speed is applied permanently
 Junglle#0896: then u get a pickup which gives u a board
 Junglle#0896: basically u use a board with the speed up power
 ron0studios#4591: how much faster can you go
 ron0studios#4591: oh lol
 Junglle#0896: subway surfers speed glitch
 ron0studios#4591: if such a client existed, i'd probably only get it once it caught on or if it was open source
 ron0studios#4591: i mean idrg why you'd need those extra frames
 ron0studios#4591: yh
 Anonimouse#7272: eh the shit ones do but that aint exactly a suprise

 Coloursplash#9680: cause nothing else is like it
 Coloursplash#9680: the writer said it is just normal sword fighting and isn‚Äôt adapted for something like water breathing for defence or thunder breathing for rapid leg movements but it‚Äôs just so unpredictable that it‚Äôs difficult to fight
 Jakwok#9307: supple joints
 Anonimouse#7272: i too am asleep
 Coloursplash#9680: beast breathing is just inosuke having weird joints and insane sense of touch
 Jakwok#9307: (he's asleep)

 Anonimouse#7272: that does not look like breathing to me tbh
 Jakwok#9307: water breathing

 Coloursplash#9680: it just is
 Jakwok#9307: but it's just not

 CapybaraEater#5386: While I'd love to write an essay modern spying and the effect of of a company on our world I'm just gonna sleep now that I've made my view on this stupid topic
 CapybaraEater#5386: All I'm saying is that all in all this doesn't negatively effect us singularly but humanity as a whole, so the only way to solve the problem is to end war and have world peace, then we can all enjoy the targeting that we want without having to consider a deeper price
 CapybaraEater#5386: Like who has ever complained about being targeted by a good product that it knows you'd like?
 CapybaraEater#5386: Therefore logically we need to accept the fact that we are spied on and instead of pointing fingers at the ones we know are doing it, realise its likely they're all doing it and instead focus on a future where it doesn't matter if our data is sold as we have nothing worth hiding
 CapybaraEater#5386: So at the end of the day be it one or a hundred our data is still getting sold and we don't have the power to enforce each company separately
 CapybaraEater#5386: And does it matter if one company does it? The fact is no matter what we do they'll always be an app that spies  on us even if just one
 CapybaraEater#5386: But like doesn't every company do that stuff?
 CapybaraEater#5386: It's ok
 ron0studios#4591: There was an opinion article from the guardian on it I think as well
 ron0studios#4591: This video essay is good

 CapybaraEater#5386: Yh
 Junglle#0896: yeah
 CapybaraEater#5386: Then word it better
 Coloursplash#9680:   did the question actually get leaked
 Obsidian360#0930: so it deserves no recognition at all, ie getting aired
 Obsidian360#0930: no i mean it's too bad for me to say something mean and degrading
 Obsidian360#0930: what
 CapybaraEater#5386: Ok can we just talk about how from Jack that's a huge compliment
 Obsidian360#0930: i was considering commenting something mean and degrading on it but you don't even deserve that
 Junglle#0896: i just made a funny but no one will understand it yet
 Obsidian360#0930: simple
 Obsidian360#0930: if they make us redo it we just stage nationwide unrest and force them to give us all 9s
 CapybaraEater#5386: If they remove it there's a chance I got full marks and that's a 8-9
 CapybaraEater#5386: I really really hope it isn't redone
 Anonimouse#7272: dude same but i lowkey cba
 I'm tired#3188: yoo if we redo it there's a chance i wont be zoinked out of my mind
 Obsidian360#0930: how does a highly classified document work its way into the hands of year 11 students
 Obsidian360#0930: how did it get leaked
 Junglle#0896: and i looked on the markscheme on twitter anyways and i got it wrong so
 CapybaraEater#5386: Same

 Coloursplash#9680: not necessarily
 Coloursplash#9680: true
 I'm tired#3188: tbh I don't think it matters, just because they have a high count , doesn't necessarily mean that they are a bad person to date
 Anonimouse#7272: ü•∞
 Coloursplash#9680: im sure alex wouldnt go above triple digits but he sleeps with me and ive done 4000 men
 Coloursplash#9680: and how much you like them
 Anonimouse#7272: depends on the person
 I'm tired#3188: Then where do you draw the line
 Coloursplash#9680: yeah they cant hold down a relationship, might be too pushy or something
 Anonimouse#7272: if ur gonna date someone thats fucked 10 dudes in the past day u must be a bit sceptical right
 I'm tired#3188: But other than that I don't see any issue
 Coloursplash#9680: yes to body count and paying if you ask them out

 Junglle#0896: of course body count matters bruh
 Junglle#0896: the girls are going to say that body count doesnt matter because they are sex workers
 Coloursplash#9680: theyre just telling them to get woke
 ron0studios#4591: jesu
 Coloursplash#9680: the girls arent letting them give any valid arguments like how faithful they are lol
 Junglle#0896: how many different people u have had sex with
 Junglle#0896: fuck no, rule of thumb is divide by 2 add 7, thats the lowest age u can date
 ron0studios#4591: body count?
 Anonimouse#7272: LOL
 Obsidian360#0930: ofc ofc

 Coloursplash#9680: i thought burnout would kick in after 10 years
 ron0studios#4591: oh no i didnt mean to ping
 ron0studios#4591: welp i guess good luck everyone for the exams, and good night
 ron0studios#4591: oh
 I'm tired#3188: Paper 2 is meh
 I'm tired#3188: Paper 1 is relatively easy
 ron0studios#4591: the mark schemes are pretty tough for chem and barely anything was cut out
 ron0studios#4591: idk why
 ron0studios#4591: im also a bit anxious abt chemistry for some reason
 ron0studios#4591: yh
 I'm tired#3188: The actual stuff is pretty easy to memorize
 ron0studios#4591: yh
 I'm tired#3188: I mean .ore specific numbers and dates
 ron0studios#4591: arigato tatsumaki
 ron0studios#4591: idk abt you but i feel like there are quite a lot of specific points required for the case studies
 I'm tired#3188: Tbh you only need a few case specific points and the rest is just theory
 ron0studios#4591: major news
 ron0studios#4591: like the collapse in 2020 for hurst castle
 ron0studios#4591: yh but your life would be a lot easier if you knew some detail for all of them
 I'm tired#3188: Lyme Regis Dorset coast and Hurst caste are all kinda the same
 ron0studios#4591: south bank
 ron0studios#4591: lyme regis, dorset coast, hurst castle, leeds, tees, cockermouth
 ron0studios#4591: geo case studies were worse than i thought they would be
 I'm tired#3188: I just put off revising them because they are cringe
 ron0studios#4591: eng quotes are something else
 I'm tired#3188: Tbh I just need to memorize case studies for geo and context and quotes for English
 Obsidian360#0930: mm
 ron0studios#4591: eng lang paper 2 might be a bit hard though
 Obsidian360#0930: yeah i don't intend to revise for english language at all
 ron0studios#4591: unless the subjects for the day after today are really easy
 ron0studios#4591: for that just do the subjects that are due the day after today lightly and the one tomorrow a lot
 Obsidian360#0930: yup
 ron0studios#4591: you're going to have to do last minute revision from now on until the 27th
 ron0studios#4591: i don't do anything else the entire day
 Obsidian360#0930: yeah i don't think my revision strategy is very good really
 ron0studios#4591: i print off what i need to use and finish them using pomodoro over 4 hours
 ron0studios#4591: on a serious note, i usually just go somewhere where there arent any electronics
 Obsidian360#0930: but i don't like it
 Obsidian360#0930: that's a good idea
 ron0studios#4591: 1. don't have discord open
 ron0studios#4591: i have some top revision tips for you
 Obsidian360#0930: oh dear
 Obsidian360#0930: i was meant to be revising
 Obsidian360#0930: oh dear i've been talking on here for the last hour
 Obsidian360#0930: i cant remember how we got here
 Obsidian360#0930: chris and alex were talking abnout eurovision and now rono and i are talking about the devil
 ron0studios#4591: mr funnell is over analysing his own joke
 I'm tired#3188: Why are there so many messages???
 ron0studios#4591: nothing much
 ron0studios#4591: isnt that a bank or something
 I'm tired#3188: What has happened?
 Obsidian360#0930: coz i'm in cahoots with him
 ron0studios#4591: he has places to be going man
 ron0studios#4591: why would the devil go to your bed
 Obsidian360#0930: lookin mighty *hot*
 Obsidian360#0930: he's actually in my bed right now as we speak
 Obsidian360#0930: oh i am in major cahoots with the devil
 ron0studios#4591: if so, I am for you, sir
 ron0studios#4591: i believe you are advocating for the devil, sir
 Obsidian360#0930: yes it is cool
 Obsidian360#0930: is innate the right word idk
 Obsidian360#0930: or people whose beds are actually aliens disguised as beds but they don't know that but have some innate feeliing that their bed is alive
 ron0studios#4591: i feel like i havent revised enough for the exams
 ron0studios#4591: yes these are very good points, I should shut up about analysing the joke üëç
 Obsidian360#0930: or people that like see ghosts every night or something
 ron0studios#4591: ...
 Obsidian360#0930: what about to people with insomnia
 ron0studios#4591: bed isnt supposed to be intimidating in the first place
 Obsidian360#0930: bed? i laugh in the face of bed

 Jakwok#9307: My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.

 Coloursplash#9680: idk who tf this is but they are on the dignitas roster
 Coloursplash#9680:
 Junglle#0896: yes hi
 Tatsu#8792:  has earned the `Jaffa cake` role!
 Twontee#1067: 
 Junglle#0896: okay i'm actually done now
 Junglle#0896: I can‚Äôt believe that Superman showed up and fought Ash Ketchum outside of Hogwarts, truly expanding the multiverse to its maximum potential
 Junglle#0896: The best part was at the end credits when Doctor Strange witnessed Batman come through America's multiversal portal and said "Well, this is certainly Strange." Honestly the best decision Marvel has made regarding jokes imo
 Junglle#0896: The moment whenever Doctor strange was down on the ground about the guy and then the villain came by and told him this is a weird predicament now ain't it and then Doctor strange said no just a strange one and then opens a portal with wolverine running in on all fours while Ghost Rider is riding on him with chains around Logan's head really made me freak out and jump for jolly
 Junglle#0896: I loved it when Dr. Strange became a construction worker and his childhood friend said "that's strange" because it really was strange.
 Junglle#0896: when dr strange comes out of the multiverse and says‚Ä¶ ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs this? some kind of venom-verse?‚Äù the entire audience stood up and clapped‚Ä¶
 Junglle#0896: I loved the part where doctor strange opened a portal to have help and venom stepped through and said ‚Äúyou know morbius is a film right?‚Äù Really brought me back down to my humanity. Shed a few tears.
 Junglle#0896: My favorite part is when Dr. Strange looks at all of the multiverses and go ‚ÄúLet there be madness‚Äù
 Junglle#0896: i lied
 Junglle#0896: I loved the part when they went to the LEGO universe and they became LEGO minifigures and Strange said "It's time to brick the Multiverse.", and "Brick just got out of hand.". Perfect, creative writing.
 Junglle#0896: I liked that part when Strange and Professor Snape encourage Ron to bring a UZi to Hogwarts. truly remarkable
 Junglle#0896: okay im done now
 Junglle#0896: Can‚Äôt forget the moment when Strange opened a portal and Vin Diesel starts talking about family and everything goes back to normal. Wholesome message.
 Anonimouse#7272: LMFAOOOOO
 Junglle#0896: That scene where Wanda looks at the camera, winks, and says, ‚ÄúWhat are we, some kind of Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness?‚Äù and Morbius says, in response, ‚Äúit‚Äôs Morbin‚Äô time!‚Äù and morbs all over the place, is üíØ, chef‚Äôs kiss
 Junglle#0896: i shat my pants multiple times during big boom boy moments love aniem women
 Junglle#0896: I started crying.
 Junglle#0896: The part where Dr Strange said to the main villain: "You don't wanna fight this guy" and Flash Thompson steps out of a portal and says: "I wouldn't wanna fight me neither".
 Junglle#0896: Truly amazing scene when Dr. Strange shouted "Time to get strange!", what an incredible piece of fiction.
 Junglle#0896: Man that scene with Morbius jumping out of the portal while saying his famous line, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Morbin time‚Äù was a masterpiece. It really made me think why the political economical status of our world correlates with Morbius. Truly a masterpiece
 Junglle#0896: Really enjoyed the cameo from Morbius in this movie, really added a cool horror element. Also when he nodded at Dr Strange and they acknowledged each other with a smile maybe hinting at a sexual relationship between them. Looking forward to see how they go forward with this.
 Obsidian360#0930: why are you still going
 Junglle#0896: I completely disagree about the use of magic part for Doctor Strange, throughout the movie he is using new and unique spells to fight when he used to only use his orange-yellow magic. The fight against the giant Octopus thing was so creative.
 Junglle#0896: I love the part where Thanos is finally on his knees, and he turns to Dr strange, and he says "well doctor, you truly are.. strange..." before collapsing into dust. That almost brought me to tears
 Junglle#0896: Love that this movie made its so morbius could shine even more, love how they reused ‚Äúit‚Äôs dr Michael morbius at your service‚Äù In the final act
 Junglle#0896: The best part in the movie definitely is the scene where Dominic Toretto steps out the portal and tells Strange ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt save the multiverse without family.‚Äù
 Junglle#0896: My favorite part of the movie is when Doctor Strange looks at the camera and says ‚ÄúWow, that certainly was a mad multiverse‚Äù. Such subtle writing will go over everyone‚Äôs head on the first viewing!
 Junglle#0896: I love the part where Dr Strange visits the dimension where everyone is a monkey and says to the camera "Well this is bananas." Really shows how talented these writers are.
 Junglle#0896: My favorite part was when Strange meets evil Doctor Strange and he says ‚ÄúIf you ever had a wet dream, it was probably me.‚Äù Truly one of the best cinematic experiences of this month.
 Junglle#0896: I just loved it when Strange noticed Wanda only wears red and said "Red is sus, lets vote her out" and they actually got the impostor, amazing!
 Junglle#0896: i loved the scene where Strange travelled to the Universe of Wonders and there he could actually SEE John Cena. and then Cena started crying that people finally notice him but then they left and Cena slowly became invisible again and Strange said: " out of sight but not out of heart" that really made me snob. such a deep powefull scene really showed the sadness of being invisible.
 Junglle#0896: When Strange looked at the camera and said: "This madness is sure multiverse." I immediately knew I had to doctor a see.
 Junglle#0896: I personally think the ending was great. Instead of defeating the main villain by usual means, Strange gave them 3 morbillion tickets for Morbius. I mean, who would stay mad at you after that?
 Obsidian360#0930: oh that was the group chat ok
 Junglle#0896: The scene where Morbius arrives through the portal, and then MORBED the entire character cast was the most brutally awesome scene I have ever seen. Marvel has truly changed for the better.
 Junglle#0896: I loved the part when Dr. Strange was travelling through the multiverse in a taxi cab and Morbius from Morbius the best grossing movie of all time appears.
 Junglle#0896: I actually liked how they defeated the villain. Especially when the main villain asks, ‚Äúrent???‚Äù Then Toby as Spider-Man swings in saying, ‚Äúyou‚Äôll get your rent when you fix this damn door!‚Äù Kind of a clever way to defeat the big villain IMO.
 Junglle#0896: I didn't expect them to give Professor Xs wheelchair such a prominent speaking role let alone making it the next Sorcerer Supreme, but I was pleasantly surprised with how much sense it made.
 Obsidian360#0930: what could possibly go wrong
 Junglle#0896: My favorite part is when Dr. Strange says ‚Äúmaybe WE were Dr. Strange and the multiverse of madness the whole time‚Ä¶‚Äù
It really made me think.
 Obsidian360#0930: i have just come back to 18 dms from a guy with an amogus pfp
 Junglle#0896: There wasn‚Äôt as much multiverse as I anticipated, but there was definitely a lot of madness.
 Junglle#0896: The best part about the movie was seeing Hugo Strange from Batman: Arkham City appear through a portal, to which Doctor Strange responded, "Well, this is peculiar. Strange, even". I jumped out of my seat during that moment. üíØ
 Junglle#0896: I cried a bit when Doctor Strange said "the real multiverse were the friends we made along the way", what a beautiful scene
 Junglle#0896: the film was so good, i loved the part where dr strange opened up a morge portal and morbius came out of it
 Coloursplash#9680: dr strange film has two post credit scenes btw if anyone is seeing it
I dont know if I should feel somewhat ashamed that this guy actually had bars rapping about that
 Anonimouse#7272: LOL?
 ron0studios#4591: 
IT EVEN RECOGNISES SARCASM HOW???
> Finally caught up with one piece and wow the tears in my eyes. The plot, The themes, the characters, the dynamics, the drama, the emotional moments...everything was garbage from beginning to end. On my way to the hospital, definitely one of the worst things I've ever seen in comics. Never had to worry about what was a part of us doing, even if he or she is not here. That was a complete waste of time after having a bad experience but I would have thought someone would be upset if a scene took longer to write because they were doing an interesting or entertaining story and would have gone and been so annoyed by it. I do really appreciate that.
> In the end, at least this manga did not give me anything I could really use but in a way that I could see myself spending a whole day of my life in. I wish I had started watching about 3 hours this morning.
 ron0studios#4591: should I put a copypasta in there??

 mangerai#0272: oops wrong message lol
 mangerai#0272: you realise for almost a year only 3 people had any admin privileges at all
 ron0studios#4591: I was thinking about why so many in the radical left participate in "speedrunning" The reason is the left's lack of work ethic ('go fast' rather than 'do it right') and, in a Petersonian sense, to elevate alternative sexual archetypes in the marketplace ('fastest hedgehog')
 ron0studios#4591: you know what im going to send

 Anonimouse#7272: LMAO
 Anonimouse#7272: no
 exorax#9275: then add the sides
 Junglle#0896: ok
 exorax#9275: so then use that angle and 2 sides to find last side w/cosine rule
 Junglle#0896: go away annomyousesmsoepussywoussybussy
 exorax#9275: yeah
 Junglle#0896: sine of this is 5/8
 Anonimouse#7272: i am x.
 exorax#9275: lol
 Anonimouse#7272: good question
 Junglle#0896: oh
 exorax#9275: yeah so what's sin(x)
 Junglle#0896: x as in c
 Junglle#0896: .
 exorax#9275: there's no x
 Junglle#0896: x = 38.68218745
 exorax#9275: what is x
 Junglle#0896: its x
 exorax#9275: is that the angle or sin of the angle
 exorax#9275: last side = 64 + 100 - (2\*8\*10\*cos(c))
 Junglle#0896: 25 = 0.5 x 8 x 10 x sin(x)
 Junglle#0896: calculator saying its 38.6821
 Junglle#0896: r u sure this is right
 exorax#9275: cos(c) = rt(39)/8
 exorax#9275: sin(c) = 5/8
 exorax#9275: 25 = 0.5\*8\*10*sin(c)
 Junglle#0896: sine rule to get area?
 exorax#9275: then use cosine rule to find last side
 exorax#9275: rearrange sine rule for area to get angle between the 8 and 10
 exorax#9275: what is it
 exorax#9275: no
 Junglle#0896: can someone help me on a maths qustion]

 mangerai#0272: black lips?
 mangerai#0272: ‚ÄúHis yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and
flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery
eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled
complexion and straight black lips.‚Äù

 CapybaraEater#5386: hell's teeth firer
 CapybaraEater#5386: there. the ultimate warcrime weapon
 CapybaraEater#5386: the spikes will be evenly placed to prevent loss of speed from spinning
 CapybaraEater#5386: the barrel will have to be shaped around the spikes, to keep it centered as it fires
 Jakwok#9307: outsource it
 Jakwok#9307: just contract some russians
 CapybaraEater#5386: that'd be too annoying to make
 Jakwok#9307: when they snap off
 Jakwok#9307: thats released
 Jakwok#9307: you could put a nerve agent inside the spikes
 CapybaraEater#5386: xactly
 CapybaraEater#5386: that way any attempt at removing will cause it to break off
 Jakwok#9307: so they snap off inside the human
 CapybaraEater#5386: the spikes should be long and very thin, made of a highly brittle and shattering material
 CapybaraEater#5386: yes, very small ball center, mostly focused around the spikes
 Jakwok#9307: Sharp balls
 CapybaraEater#5386: plus sharper
 CapybaraEater#5386: smaller to be lighter and more annoying to remove
 Jakwok#9307: What size balls
 CapybaraEater#5386: brilliant warfare
 CapybaraEater#5386: that would be really good
 CapybaraEater#5386: really small thin centres with large spikes around it
 Jakwok#9307: Spike factory
 CapybaraEater#5386: yooo what about a gun which fires spike balls
 Jakwok#9307: Lego bullets
I thought this would fit his style
 CapybaraEater#5386: no bullets built to maim not kill
 ron0studios#4591: one of the guys that do tha
 ron0studios#4591: jeaney collects is the guy who reads out funny chat messages, twitter posts/replies
 Jakwok#9307: Yes but you said they'll be so shit that governments will have to make new laws
 CapybaraEater#5386: it'll have to be a large size gun, rifleish
 CapybaraEater#5386: and the weight is a fair point
 CapybaraEater#5386: it can be aerodynamic if built correctly
 Jakwok#9307: Depending on how its done
 Jakwok#9307: Won't be aerodynamic and if it is too heavy
 CapybaraEater#5386: yh sure
 ron0studios#4591: youtuber
 CapybaraEater#5386: what is jeaney collects?
 ron0studios#4591: can I send this to jeaney collects?
 CapybaraEater#5386: a new type of spring powered ammo, the bullets have spikes inside which will spin around once in the body, causing great pain and damage
 ron0studios#4591: as a project or like the fact that you want to work at an arms company?
 CapybaraEater#5386: firstly
 ron0studios#4591: is making a gun genuinely unironically what you want to do?
 CapybaraEater#5386: like weapons built to maim not kill, drilling bullets and shit
 Anonimouse#7272:

 I'm tired#3188: I spent all of yesterday, and today trying to make it work but AAAAAAA
 I'm tired#3188: Wtf?????? I spent three hours trying to figure out why my circuit wasn't work and here's of list of stuff I've done:
Rewired almost every wire
Used a different battery
Used different chips
Resoldered my potentiometer that just spontaneously disconnected )
Used a bulky power supply
Used a different transistor
Used a different battery connector
Used a mosFET
Prayed
I think I have an idea of what it is but it's so stupid:
My D type flip flop outputs 0.6V when logic 0, which I'm thinking is almost enough to make the transistor conduct, which is why my outputs are so whacky. When I reset my flip flop it still makes the outputs do stuff, even though they are not, because my transistor is conducting a bit. But what do I do about it ? ¬Ø\__/¬Ø
It conducts when it logic 0 is the input, I'm thinking the only thing I can do is use an opamp comparator but that would be stupid and would add another block. I'm planning on using the mosFET again, because maybe it was being weird because of the potentiometer dying but if that doesn't work I have zero idea of what to do?

 ron0studios#4591: they are part, diced onions
 Jakwok#9307: That's not enough onions to be called onions
 ron0studios#4591: those are onions
 ron0studios#4591: and above the cheese
 ron0studios#4591: the white solid next to the ketchup
 ron0studios#4591: they don't even bother grilling the onions

 ron0studios#4591: already got a warning don't want to get banned lol
 ron0studios#4591: hey i could help you but I need to confirm first whether piracy is allowed on discord and this server in particular?
 exorax#9275: i have recommended specs tho so i assume it'll run fine even if i need to drop quality a bit
 exorax#9275: tragic
 Jakwok#9307: Apparently it doesn't run the greatest on pc
 exorax#9275: if you do find something that works and is trustworthy tell me

 ron0studios#4591: Cheese is a food derived from milk that is produced in a wide range of flavors, textures, and forms by coagulation of the milk protein casein. It comprises proteins and fat from milk, usually the milk of cows, buffalo, goats, or sheep. During production, the milk is usually acidified, and adding the enzyme rennet causes coagulation. The solids are separated and pressed into final form.[1] Some cheeses have molds on the rind or throughout. Most cheeses melt at cooking temperature.
Hundreds of types of cheese from various countries are produced. Their styles, textures and flavors depend on the origin of the milk , whether they have been pasteurized, the butterfat content, the bacteria and mold, the processing, and aging. Herbs, spices, or wood smoke may be used as flavoring agents. The yellow to red color of many cheeses, such as Red Leicester, is produced by adding annatto. Other ingredients may be added to some cheeses, such as black pepper, garlic, chives or cranberries.
For a few cheeses, the milk is curdled by adding acids such as vinegar or lemon juice. Most cheeses are acidified to a lesser degree by bacteria, which turn milk sugars into lactic acid, then the addition of rennet completes the curdling. Vegetarian alternatives to rennet are available; most are produced by fermentation of the fungus Mucor miehei, but others have been extracted from various species of the Cynara thistle family. Cheesemakers near a dairy region may benefit from fresher, lower-priced milk, and lower shipping costs.

 exorax#9275: i couldn't find a reasonable way to chop off the first line of the input file without multiple things and the 3rd line of code was mainly bc of clutter
 ron0studios#4591: but dang that looks cool
 ron0studios#4591: you could do it in one line if you use commas, but thats probably cheating

 Coloursplash#9680:   watch haikyu
 Jakwok#9307: Not funny. I didn't laugh. Your joke is so bad I would have preferred the joke went over my head and you gave up re-telling me the joke. To be honest this is a horrible attempt at trying to get a laugh out of me. Not a chuckle, not a hehe, not even a subtle burst of air out of my esophagus. Science says before you laugh your brain preps your face muscles but I didn't even feel the slightest twitch. 0/10 this joke is so bad I can't believe anyone legally allowed you to be creative at all. The amount of brain power you must have put into that joke has the potential to power every house on Earth. Get a personality and learn how to make jokes, read a book. I'm not saying this to be funny i genuinely mean it on how this is just bottom barrel embarrassment at comedy. You've single handedly killed humor and every comedic act on the planet. I'm so disappointed that society has failed as a whole in being able to teach you how to be funny. Honestly if I put in all my power and time to try and make your joke funny it would require Einstein himself to build a device to strap me into so I can be connected to the energy of a billion stars to do it, and even then all that joke would get from people is a subtle scuff. You're lucky i still have the slightest of empathy for you after telling that joke otherwise I would have committed every war crime in the book just to prevent you from attempting any humor ever again. We should put that joke in text books so future generations can be wary of becoming such an absolute comedic failure. I'm disappointed, hurt, and outright offended that my precious time has been wasted in my pathetic brain understanding that joke. In the time that took i was planning on helping kids who have been orphaned, but because of that you've wasted my time explaining the obscene integrity of your terrible attempt at comedy. Now those kids are suffering with out meals and there's nobody to blame but you. I hope you're happy with what you have done.

 ‚ìê‚ìì‚ì°‚ìò‚ìê‚ìù#8281: propane will usually be slower than a speeding rocket. This not only means that the projectiles will take more time to reach the enemy, it will also mean more projectiles will be avoided. There is still more. The flamethrower is a projectile weapon with spread. This spread will mean even more projectiles miss the target.
*Soldier will get damage to his targets before the Pyro.*
*The Pyro will usually do far less damage in 1.6 seconds.*
This means, Pyro, known as the close range class, can end up doing less damage in close range than the class who can spam rockets across the entire map.
Pyro does have another factor, airblast. Before I talk about AIRblast, I want to remind people that "Pyro" means FIRE, just putting this fact here. Airblast can reflect certain projectiles and give them minicrits. It can't reflect hitscan, it can't reflect all projectiles. TF2 is an online game that uses servers. Well, in point blank, a projectile would quickly hit you, and the server would quickly register that before it registers the airblast. So on the close range class, the airblast won't even work in close range unless you predict or get lucky. A final fact, the meta in high tier competitive leagues is that Pyro stays back and DEFENDS his team. Another fact, Pyro is listed as an OFFENSE class.
 ‚ìê‚ìì‚ì°‚ìò‚ìê‚ìù#8281: Pyro's damage:
Pyro shoots a flame particle about every 0.044 seconds, or about 22.72 particles per second. Each particle ends up doing about 6.80 damage. In the end, Pyro's max dps is 154 damage per second. Remember the asterisks.
*Soldier can do 336 damge in 1.6 seconds.*
*Pyro can do 246.4 damage in 1.6 seconds*
However, the shortest range primary in the game has damage fall off, and rarely does combat occur in literal point blank range. With fall off, a flame particles ends up doing about 4.76 damage. This means at the flamethrower's tip, the dps is 108 dps. With ramp up, Syringe Gun does 120 dps. 120 dps > 108 dps.
BUT WAIT, THERE IS MORE!
Pyro's mechanics:
An aspect of damage in TF2 is how said damage gets to the enemy. The speed of Pyro's flame particles depend on the Pyro's speed. Pyro's burning
 ‚ìê‚ìì‚ì°‚ìò‚ìê‚ìù#8281: Pyro's health compared to other classes:
1. Heavy - 300 health 
2. Soldier - 200 health
3/4. Demoman - 175 health
> 3/4. Pyro - 175 health <
5. Medic - 150 health
This means the Pyro is a medium class, definitely not tanky. Unlike other classes, Pyro also lacks unlocks that improve his tankiness.
Pyro's walking speed compared to other classes:
1. Scout - 133% Speed
2. Medic - 107% Speed
3. Spy - 107% Speed
4/5/6. Sniper - 100% Speed
4/5/6. Engineer - 100% Speed
> 4/5/6. Pyro - 100% Speed <
7. Demoman - 93% Speed
BUT
Pyro's extra mobility options compared to other classes:
Soldier and Demoman have explosive jumps. Scout has double jumps.
Pyro by default has ZERO extra mobility options.
So in general? Pyro only beats the mobility of one class, the Heavy. Pyro has the 2nd worst mobility in the game.
P.S. Pyro can flare-jump with UNLOCKS, but flare-jumping is literally weaker than Wrangler jumping.
Pyro's range:
Pyro's primary has the lowest range in the game, period. Minigun and scattergun have spread but they can still deal damage beyond their optimal range.
Scout's secondary, the pistol, is better at longer ranges than Pyro's secondary, the shotgun.
P.S. With unlocks, Pyro can shoot flares, but these can still be dodged as they are non-explosive projectiles, while the pistol is hitscan. Also, flares aren't even optimal unless the target is on fire.

 exorax#9275: simply do not
 CapybaraEater#5386: Bruh that's all I do
 I'm tired#3188: watch how i just forget what division is
 exorax#9275: literally that's half of exams
 exorax#9275: just don't panic
 exorax#9275: you'll be fine
 I'm tired#3188: you pathetic fools im water resistant
 CapybaraEater#5386: God I am fucked
 CapybaraEater#5386: Yh ig you could do that instead
 exorax#9275: moisten up
 I'm tired#3188: a hussk
 I'm tired#3188: im dry
 I'm tired#3188: no
 exorax#9275: just be good
 I'm tired#3188: literally infinitely easier than pythagoras
 exorax#9275: i didn't actually use sine rule but ig that works too
 exorax#9275: qed
 I'm tired#3188: 1/2abSin(c) doesn't need height
 exorax#9275: so we have (p^2 - 1) * x^2 * 3sqrt(3)/2
 exorax#9275: since area scales with the square of side length shaded area is proportional to p^2 - 1
 CapybaraEater#5386: Half the triangle then pythagoras
 CapybaraEater#5386: Wait
 CapybaraEater#5386: Wait how did you work out the height of the triangle?
 BADGER#7138: Very much trolling
 exorax#9275: fucked up slightly in typing hold on
 CapybaraEater#5386: Ohhh * means times
 CapybaraEater#5386: This is hard to understand with your mix of letters and words
 exorax#9275: so 3x^2*sqrt(3)/2
 exorax#9275: area of hexagon = 6* that
 exorax#9275: = x^2*sqrt(3)/4
 exorax#9275: area of 1 equilateral triangle = hb/2 = x * sqrt (x^2 - (x/2)^2) * 1/2
 CapybaraEater#5386: OK I mildly do, without paper I can semi understand it
 CapybaraEater#5386: I do
 CapybaraEater#5386: Wait nvm
 CapybaraEater#5386: That being said idfk how to answer it
 CapybaraEater#5386: So that's where the divided by 2 comes from
 CapybaraEater#5386: Yh cus there's 6 triangles in each hexagon
 CapybaraEater#5386: I'm guessing you use triangles

 ron0studios#4591: srry
 tired#2515: Ok
 ron0studios#4591: I am being sarcastic
 tired#2515: That is not gcse
 tired#2515: What are you talking about
 ron0studios#4591: i thought it was sin(lim->x) = cos(theta^-1)
 ron0studios#4591: wait what
 I'm tired#3188: Area of square is base x height
 Jakwok#9307: basically
 Jakwok#9307: which is what it tells you
 Jakwok#9307: (a+4)(a+4) - 70 = a^2
 Jakwok#9307: rearrange it
 Jakwok#9307: so
 Junglle#0896: but how do you get that
 Jakwok#9307: pretty much
 Jakwok#9307: yes
 I'm tired#3188: I think
 Jakwok#9307: and then
 I'm tired#3188: Expand and solve
 Jakwok#9307: is the difference
 I'm tired#3188: (a+4)(a+4) - a^2=70
 Jakwok#9307: square root of 70
 I'm tired#3188: I'll do it later I'm having dinner
 I'm tired#3188: For 60&30¬∞
 I'm tired#3188: And right angle triangle with sides 1,1,and root 2
 ron0studios#4591: oh i thought it was something else
 ron0studios#4591: for 30 45 and 60
 I'm tired#3188: Equilateral triangle with sides of 2, split into 2 right angle triangle
 ron0studios#4591: for the sines you go from 1 to sqrt 2 to sqrt 3
 ron0studios#4591: all of the sines and cosines are over 2
 ron0studios#4591: not shantanu but i could probably help:
 Junglle#0896:  can u send me the sine and cosine rule table thing
 Junglle#0896: wrong person

 Anonimouse#7272: what the fucj
 Anonimouse#7272: 
 Anonimouse#7272: yes.
 CapybaraEater#5386: i'm very much not, i'm just stating the obvious
 Coloursplash#9680: can i be the bussy to your sussy?
 Coloursplash#9680: im not sure if you realise it ruben but you are literally fishing for compliments
 Coloursplash#9680: too busy watching towie to revise
 Anonimouse#7272: wow essex people wildin
 Coloursplash#9680: 50% is the whole country, almost 70% in essex
 Anonimouse#7272: ~~wait is it seriously 70 I thought it was like 50 lmao~~
 Anonimouse#7272: ^^
 Coloursplash#9680: ruben what i said is an objective fact
 Anonimouse#7272: most people in set 3 do
 Anonimouse#7272: odds are u get an 8
 CapybaraEater#5386: thats prob true
 CapybaraEater#5386: not the thing alex said
 CapybaraEater#5386: bullshit.
 Anonimouse#7272: actually an 8 is the top 5% but close enough
 Coloursplash#9680: and 8 is easily top 10% then
 Coloursplash#9680: immediately places you in the top 30%
 Coloursplash#9680: okay something that is true: you are likely going to get an 8 in maths when 70% of kids in essex don't get a 4/5
 CapybaraEater#5386: something certainly true and not based on opinion
 Anonimouse#7272: define objective
 Coloursplash#9680: you refuse to accept any of your strengths
 CapybaraEater#5386: i believe in objective facts, thats why
 Coloursplash#9680: no matter how often you say he is smart or he can do it or whatever he wont listen
 CapybaraEater#5386: denial about what?
 Coloursplash#9680: bro ive already said loads of stuff to ruben but he is in denial okay
 Anonimouse#7272: i said three seconds
 BADGER#7138: nvm
 Anonimouse#7272: breaking news chris stops extremely convincing monkey act for 3 seconds to give real advice
 Coloursplash#9680: see, cant say im unhelpful now
 Coloursplash#9680: that is genuinely an extremely toxic mentality, having depression doesn't make you unnormal, it is literally an illness you can get help for
 CapybaraEater#5386: ikr
 CapybaraEater#5386: what am i meant to be coping with? i'm normal
 Anonimouse#7272: I figured that one out without your help
 BADGER#7138: whos jamie?
 Coloursplash#9680: fun fact: jamie does not affiliate himself with me
 Coloursplash#9680: _c o p e_
 CapybaraEater#5386: i don't have anything
 CapybaraEater#5386: wdym why?
 Coloursplash#9680: it says to not drink too much alcohol
 Coloursplash#9680: ruben, are you drinking too much alcohol?
 BADGER#7138: bro...
 BADGER#7138: but you did, and you got in
 Anonimouse#7272: and then u did and got in?
 CapybaraEater#5386: my parents didn't even plan to apply, thats how bad i was and am
 Coloursplash#9680: fun fact: you are smart
 Anonimouse#7272: fun fact: not everyone applies to kegs
 BADGER#7138: and you still got in
 CapybaraEater#5386: fun fact, kegs has over a 25% acceptance rate
 Coloursplash#9680: calm down there mate, if your ego gets any bigger then the roof will blow off
 BADGER#7138: and that was only people who actually did it
 BADGER#7138: about 1000 people did the 11+, you were one of the 150 that got into kegs
 CapybaraEater#5386: i certainly wasn't top 5, i was top 25 maybe at top. i legit used to go to a normal school and i wasn;t even top set there, i was bottom
 BADGER#7138: there are people aiming for 4s
 Anonimouse#7272: ^^^ half the country takes the fucken foundation mate
 CapybaraEater#5386: remember how we have those yellow stickers everywhere that faded within a week
 BADGER#7138: and your dsoing higher paper
 BADGER#7138: if you were top 5% years ago,  and you dont believe that you have kept up with the progression, ur still at least top 15%
 Anonimouse#7272: respect
 CapybaraEater#5386: ikr
 Anonimouse#7272: mans musta banged his 11+ into the moon
 CapybaraEater#5386: and?? a literally blind kid got into kegs, literally anyone can if they just get lucky
 Anonimouse#7272: it doesn't matter that it's the bottom, it's kegs
 CapybaraEater#5386: it doesn't matter that it's kegs, it's the bottom
 Anonimouse#7272: ?
 CapybaraEater#5386: doesn't matter
 Anonimouse#7272: at kegs
 CapybaraEater#5386: i'm set three
 CapybaraEater#5386: i have done many maths tests, i can't do the majority of the questions
 Anonimouse#7272: not really but go on
 Anonimouse#7272: ok
 CapybaraEater#5386: but you get the point
 CapybaraEater#5386: they're mostly faded
 CapybaraEater#5386: not anymore
 CapybaraEater#5386: well
 CapybaraEater#5386: ok, every time i get a question wrong in maths, i usually cut myself once, you can count the cuts and see its a whole fucking lot.
 Anonimouse#7272: go on provide me all the evidence you have for yourself being *bad* at maths
 CapybaraEater#5386: knowing my maths ability i was
 Anonimouse#7272: ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
 CapybaraEater#5386: i think i was wrong then
 Anonimouse#7272: would smash
 Anonimouse#7272: real
 exorax#9275: thicc cylinder üò≥
 Anonimouse#7272: that was right iirc
 BADGER#7138: im got 814
 BADGER#7138: idk
 Anonimouse#7272:  on that dt question u needed half 2 pi r + 1000mm and then times by thiccness
 exorax#9275: cylindrake
 CapybaraEater#5386: thats what it called it
 CapybaraEater#5386: it's an open sided cylinder
 BADGER#7138: was
 BADGER#7138: it has half of a small hollow one
 exorax#9275: same as cylinder but minus one circle
 Anonimouse#7272: that was not a cylinder
 exorax#9275: so pi√ór^2 + 2pi√ór√óh
 BADGER#7138: it came up on dt
 exorax#9275: ohh surface gotcha
 BADGER#7138: imagine you have half of a hollow cylinder, and you need to calculate the inside surface area
 exorax#9275: by definition one edge has no inside or outside
 exorax#9275: by inside edge what do you mean
 CapybaraEater#5386: lmao ikr
 BADGER#7138: that was a weird question
 CapybaraEater#5386: oof
 Anonimouse#7272: wrong exor
 BADGER#7138: top 30??
 CapybaraEater#5386:  inside edge of an open cylindar?
 Anonimouse#7272: or was it 25 I honestly don‚Äôt remember
 exorax#9275: i am too good
 exorax#9275: exactly
 Anonimouse#7272: not top 50 maths uk for nothing
 exorax#9275: yw
 exorax#9275: side length squared
 Anonimouse#7272: wot
 BADGER#7138: ur right tyhen
 CapybaraEater#5386: just not the squaree one
 CapybaraEater#5386: ik the trapezium one
 CapybaraEater#5386: wait  i mean parololol,olollolgram
 Anonimouse#7272: top side+bottom side over two times vertical height  
 CapybaraEater#5386: apparently it's vertical height times length
 BADGER#7138: i hope its provided
 BADGER#7138: neither do i
 CapybaraEater#5386: i didn't know the area of a trapezium
 BADGER#7138: no you werent
 CapybaraEater#5386: yes i was
 BADGER#7138: u werent earlier
 CapybaraEater#5386: i'm failing on simple questions
 Anonimouse#7272: odds are its gonna be an 8 but alright
 CapybaraEater#5386: thats why i put  or 7
 Anonimouse#7272: ur not getting a 6 on ur gcse
 CapybaraEater#5386: likely both lmao
 Anonimouse#7272: in the mock or the gcse
 CapybaraEater#5386: so now my parents are gonna see my 6 or 7 and assume i'm not trying
 Anonimouse#7272: where issue
 CapybaraEater#5386: she's predicted me a 9
 Anonimouse#7272: what did miss black do this time
 CapybaraEater#5386: i hate Miss black with a burning passion.
 CapybaraEater#5386: nvm
 CapybaraEater#5386: i think i'm being an idiot
 CapybaraEater#5386: waot
 CapybaraEater#5386: so then what do we do to see which one?
 CapybaraEater#5386: therefore we can see b is either -9 or 9
 BADGER#7138: so one of the brackets must be 0
 CapybaraEater#5386: ah ok
 BADGER#7138: as the equation is (x+5) (x-6)= **0**
 CapybaraEater#5386: then we can get 27+3b = 0
 CapybaraEater#5386: so we just assume that both bits are 0
 BADGER#7138: when multiplied together, the brackets need to equal 0
 Anonimouse#7272: .
 BADGER#7138: exactly
 CapybaraEater#5386: 0x4 is o tho
 Anonimouse#7272: but whatever
 Anonimouse#7272: well thats not quite true
 Anonimouse#7272: and 0x0 is 0 therefore both bits need to be 0
 CapybaraEater#5386: yh but you're intelligent enough to already know it
 Anonimouse#7272: neither has anyone
 BADGER#7138: because it isnt just (3x+8) (6x+2), its (3x+8) (6x+2) **=0**
 exorax#9275: we havent specifically been taught this tbh
 CapybaraEater#5386: which we havn't covered for 2 years
 Anonimouse#7272: its just algebra
 CapybaraEater#5386: lmao set 3 hasn't been taught any of this
 BADGER#7138: baisically, you need to make one of the brackets 0 so that when the other is multiplied by it, it equals 0
 exorax#9275: yeah you rearrange it so something equals 0
 Jakwok#9307: then you make the other one zero as well
 Jakwok#9307: can be solved
 Jakwok#9307: so that the rest of the equation
 Jakwok#9307: you make it zero
 Anonimouse#7272: look at the end of the eq
 CapybaraEater#5386: how am i meant to know its going to equal 0?
 BADGER#7138: 18#
 Anonimouse#7272: hint: its a
 Anonimouse#7272: what number do u take away from 41 to get 0
 CapybaraEater#5386: wdym?
 CapybaraEater#5386: he explained all the stuff i did understand then left
 Anonimouse#7272: ok so 41 - what number is 0
 CapybaraEater#5386: yes
 Anonimouse#7272: do u understand how he got there
 CapybaraEater#5386: yes
 Anonimouse#7272: is what david said
 Anonimouse#7272: x(41-a) + 27 + 3b = 0
 CapybaraEater#5386: b is -9
 CapybaraEater#5386: a is 41
 Anonimouse#7272: give me the answer
 CapybaraEater#5386: just not how to get there
 Anonimouse#7272: ok cool
 CapybaraEater#5386: well i know the answer
 Anonimouse#7272: do u just want me to solve it
 CapybaraEater#5386: well then can't i just make it 1 and leave it?
 Anonimouse#7272: but maybe?
 Anonimouse#7272: uh tbh i didnt look at it properly
 CapybaraEater#5386: ah so it can be anything?
 Anonimouse#7272: yeah x is irrelevant
 Anonimouse#7272: oh its find a and b
 CapybaraEater#5386: thats why i'm asking
 CapybaraEater#5386: ik
 Anonimouse#7272: that‚Äôs generally not how algebra works
 Anonimouse#7272: huh
 CapybaraEater#5386: wait so can x be any number and it would still have the same answer
 CapybaraEater#5386: ok i have no idea how to do this
 CapybaraEater#5386: i'm just going to mess around and see if an answer appears
 exorax#9275: yeah you can substitute 2 values in and solve them simultaneously
 CapybaraEater#5386: gg
 BADGER#7138: gg
 Coloursplash#9680: mob is no more
 CapybaraEater#5386: i choose 0.3 recurring
 CapybaraEater#5386: oh so can i just make x legit anything?'
 exorax#9275: so you can solve from there
 exorax#9275: is true for all x
 CapybaraEater#5386: ah thanks
 exorax#9275: x(41-a) + 27 + 3b = 0
 CapybaraEater#5386: ah then make it x(35+6-A)?
 exorax#9275: so 35x + 40 + 6x + 3b = ax + 13
 CapybaraEater#5386: x()
 CapybaraEater#5386: ah then do the grouping thing
 exorax#9275: expand brackets so all x are together
 CapybaraEater#5386: is it about finding x then substituting?

 Coloursplash#9680: I dreamed that, as I wandered by the way,
Bare Winter suddenly was changed to Spring,
And gentle odours led my steps astray,
Mixed with a sound of waters murmuring
Along a shelving bank of turf, which lay
Under a copse, and hardly dared to fling
Its green arms round the bosom of the stream,
But kissed it and then fled, as thou mightest in dream.
There grew pied wind-flowers and violets,
Daisies, those pearled Arcturi of the earth,
The constellated flower that never sets;
Faint oxlips; tender bluebells, at whose birth
The sod scarce heaved; and that tall flower that wets‚Äî
Like a child, half in tenderness and mirth‚Äî
Its mother's face with Heaven's collected tears,
When the low wind, its playmate's voice, it hears.
And in the warm hedge grew lush eglantine,
Green cowbind and the moonlight-coloured may,
And cherry-blossoms, and white cups, whose wine
Was the bright dew, yet drained not by the day;
And wild roses, and ivy serpentine,
With its dark buds and leaves, wandering astray;
And flowers azure, black, and streaked with gold,
Fairer than any wakened eyes behold.
And nearer to the river's trembling edge
There grew broad flag-flowers, purple pranked with white,
And starry river buds among the sedge,
And floating water-lilies, broad and bright,
Which lit the oak that overhung the hedge
With moonlight beams of their own watery light;
And bulrushes, and reeds of such deep green
As soothed the dazzled eye with sober sheen.
Methought that of these visionary flowers
I made a nosegay, bound in such a way
That the same hues, which in their natural bowers
Were mingled or opposed, the like array
Kept these imprisoned children of the Hours
Within my hand,‚Äîand then, elate and gay,
I hastened to the spot whence I had come,
That I might there present it!‚ÄîOh! to whom?

 Obsidian360#0930: fucking hell
 Obsidian360#0930: and instead gets wood
 Obsidian360#0930: ive also realised he doesnt get the 4 glass he should be getting if hes doing end
 Obsidian360#0930: hes gained 2 finals in the last half hour LMFAO
 Obsidian360#0930: but anyway i ended up doing a 1v4 clutch
 Obsidian360#0930: he never buys blocks
 Obsidian360#0930: i think hes secretly ruben
 Obsidian360#0930: we got midrushed again and he did nothing to stop it
 Obsidian360#0930: we got midrushed and he stood at our base afk then instantly died trying to fight the guy, who he outgeared and out stats'd
 Obsidian360#0930: but he's the leader so we cant kick him
 Obsidian360#0930: luckily the other people in the party are good
 Obsidian360#0930: he's got like 3 finals in the last 4 games
 Obsidian360#0930: i thought he was a 4v4 main when i saw his stats
 Anonimouse#7272: HOW
 Anonimouse#7272: LMAO
 Obsidian360#0930: he mains 4s and has more wins than finals
 mangerai#0272: kinda cringe

 exorax#9275: wtfrick i wanted a cookie
 Junglle#0896: aired
 CapybaraEater#5386: they're brilliant
 CapybaraEater#5386: my new favorite things are malaphors
 Anonimouse#7272:  stop liking men and give these guys their cookies
 CapybaraEater#5386: i think we both deserve a cookie for ruining it so well
 CapybaraEater#5386: ikr
 exorax#9275: scammed
 CapybaraEater#5386: i think Tom is just gonna give up and stay silent though
 CapybaraEater#5386: yay we ruined a fun puzzle with god-forsaken logic
 exorax#9275: ruben can have like half of it if it's 184 bc he pointed out the question better
 CapybaraEater#5386: that seems most logical
 exorax#9275: i want my cookie either way
 CapybaraEater#5386: 184
 exorax#9275: so 24 or 184 depending on what you mean
 Anonimouse#7272: good god
 exorax#9275: the entire image is 184
 CapybaraEater#5386: and to me it wouldn't make sense if the "solution" after the message was actually correct because why even ask at that point
 CapybaraEater#5386: he just said "how many triangles"
 CapybaraEater#5386: yh exactly
 exorax#9275: if it's the second we're both wrong
 exorax#9275: if it's the first you're wrong
 exorax#9275:  did you want the number of triangles on the single grid or the number present in that entire image
 CapybaraEater#5386: no but like it never specifies that only the blue triangles count
 exorax#9275: no that is an extension of you being wrong bc of this
 CapybaraEater#5386: but i cba to do the maths for this
 CapybaraEater#5386: i'm wrong because on the empty grid there are lots of triangles not just one
 CapybaraEater#5386: technically i am wrong but not due to this
 exorax#9275: if you don't think this counts as the whole grid you would have said 2 triangles
 exorax#9275: exactly
 CapybaraEater#5386: 1
 CapybaraEater#5386: it never specified that the grid didn't count
 exorax#9275: that is literally wrong
 exorax#9275: if i showed you a single triangle you would say there is 1 triangle
 CapybaraEater#5386: the grid is a traingle
 CapybaraEater#5386: no
 exorax#9275: but the thing that is nothing is not a triangle
 CapybaraEater#5386: none of them are purely the grid with nothing else
 CapybaraEater#5386: there's 24 things shown on that sheet
 CapybaraEater#5386: it legit isn't
 mangerai#0272: literally is but ok
 CapybaraEater#5386: So it'd be 25
 CapybaraEater#5386: That isn't included in the 24
 CapybaraEater#5386: The grid itself is a triangle
 CapybaraEater#5386: No I'm talking about the empty grid
 Anonimouse#7272: ...
 Anonimouse#7272: its included in the 24
 CapybaraEater#5386: Lmao where's my cookie
 CapybaraEater#5386: Therefore there's 25
 CapybaraEater#5386: The entire grid is a triangle
 CapybaraEater#5386: Think David
 CapybaraEater#5386: Nope
 CapybaraEater#5386: Like 25
 exorax#9275: anyway i still want my cookie
 Anonimouse#7272: LMAO
 exorax#9275: it's 24
 exorax#9275: why did u attach the image all of them are there

 Anonimouse#7272: insane
 Jakwok#9307: First upgrade
 Jakwok#9307: I went ring of fire
 Jakwok#9307: I always end up building the wrong one
 exorax#9275: bottom path is best but blades are good coverage earlygame
 Anonimouse#7272: imo if u dont mind losing fb then 230 start >
 Jakwok#9307: Hm ok
 Jakwok#9307: Like which upgrades
 exorax#9275: one 203 then 1 or 2 230s then spam 204s

 Anonimouse#7272: tack village alch is meta rn
 Jakwok#9307: Wait which tack build is best
 Jakwok#9307: Ig
 exorax#9275: but like it's still better to use shimmer since that's much more consistent decamo
 Jakwok#9307: Aoe
 exorax#9275: yeah true
 Jakwok#9307: Does that not do aor
 Jakwok#9307: I think
 Jakwok#9307: Could go flash bomb
 Jakwok#9307: Fair enough
 exorax#9275: counter esionage is annoying bc ninjas aren't good grouped damage
 exorax#9275: wof good but x3x and x4x aren't that good compared to other wizards
 Jakwok#9307: If I go counter espionage on ninjas I won't need shimmer
 Jakwok#9307: So I just stuck with it
 Jakwok#9307: For matches I play anyway
 Jakwok#9307: Well wall of flame is lowkey broken early game
 exorax#9275: well yeah 042 is also scuffed
 exorax#9275: 402 is better raw dps but 204 can feed off eco bloons so it might be better in battles
 Jakwok#9307: Since camo
 Jakwok#9307: Well I switch one of each
 exorax#9275: 240 wizard is scuffed
 Jakwok#9307: Top or bottom path
 Jakwok#9307: What's better
 Jakwok#9307: I haven't got enough exp for anything else

 CapybaraEater#5386: yay
 Junglle#0896:  is physics test today
 CapybaraEater#5386: I do not see the downside of anal sex with a dolphin
 Jakwok#9307: here
There are various ways a dolphin has of showing that she or he is interested in sex.
Males are probably the easiest to detect. They will swim around, sporting an erection , and will have no bones about swimming up to you and placing their member within reach of your hand.
If you are in the water, they may rub it along any part of your body, or wrap it around your wrist or ankle.  Their belly will also be pinkish in colour, which also denotes sexual excitement.
Females can be a little harder. The most obvious way a female dolphin has of displaying her sexual interest is the pink-belly effect. Their genitals become very pink and swollen, making the genital region very prominent. They may be restless, or they may be acting as normal. If you are out of the water, they may swim up to you and roll belly up, exposing themselves to you, coupled with pelvic thrusts. If you are in the water, they may press their genitals up against yours, nibble your fingers, nuzzle your crotch, or do pelvic thrusts against you.
Each dolphins way of expressing sexual readiness varies, so the longer you know the dolphin, the better you will detect when they are sexually active.
When a male dolphin is interested in you, about the only thing you can do, if you are male, is to masturbate him.  WARNING! You should NEVER let a male dolphin attempt anal sex with you. The Bottle-nose dolphin member is around 12 inches, very muscular, and the thrusting and the force of ejaculation (A male can cum as far as 14 feet) would cause serious internal injuries, resulting in peritonitus and possible death.

 Jakwok#9307: Wait yes
 Junglle#0896: 
 Junglle#0896: Hey guys, did you know that in terms of male human and female Pok√©mon breeding, Vaporeon is the most compatible Pok√©mon for humans? Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3‚Äù03‚Äô tall and 63.9 pounds, this means they‚Äôre large enough to be able handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base Stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water based biology, there‚Äôs no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll Eyes, Captivate, Charm, and Tail Whip, along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it‚Äôd be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue with enough water. No other Pok√©mon comes close to this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white. Vaporeon is literally built for human dick. Ungodly defense stat+high HP pool+Acid Armor means it can take cock all day, all shapes and sizes and still come for more

 Junglle#0896: How are nice guys treated like shit?
Nice guys get treated like shit by women who fail to notice it. Most women who do notice a nice guy tend to just say that the guy is nice, caring and loving and that any girl would be lucky to have them. Then, that same woman will date a complete asshole and then complain about him being an asshole and how there are no nice guys anymore. Hence the reason why nice guys are treated like shit, because women will notice it, yet shrug it off and date someone who's physically attractive and who is a total asshole towards her daily, which I guess is a major turn on to most women. Now do you see the reason why nice guys get treated like shit? To sum it all up, nice guys are looked down upon for not being attractive enough.

 Coloursplash#9680: ,,It‚Äôs the Third Day. I can‚Äôt take this any longer. Roblox has been down for 72 hours and my body cannot handle this copious amount of mental stress. I‚Äôve had numerous seizures from the lack of entertainment and content from Roblox. During the 72 hours I had found myself breathless and unable to speak. No matter how long I sleep I can‚Äôt find the energy to even leave my bed. This is hell. It seems that I won‚Äôt be able to find salvation anytime soon‚Ä¶ I hope that soon enough the Heavens will grace me with Roblox once again and that I can soon see my precious Meeps and Adopt Me pets. I am sure they are starving right now. I can already foresee my fate. I shall collapse under heart failure as I see my PC screen flash: ‚ÄúWe are no longer working on Roblox. Take care. -ROBLOX‚Äù. The sheer weight of that message had doomed me into falling into the endless abyss of boredom. I cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel‚Ä¶ I fear that this may never come to an end. I feel as though that if I don‚Äôt play roblox I would be writhing for the next 10 hours in horrible agony. I may unconsciously harm myself or others if I don‚Äôt receive any entertainment from Roblox right this instant. It‚Äôs now 10 minutes later, I am having frequent blackouts and my sanity is deteriorating. I asked my parents to isolate me in my room so I don‚Äôt cause harm to them in any way. I have also already destroyed my bed. As I cry myself to sleep for the twelfth time since the shutdown, I lay in my annihilated room, my distraught parents seeking help from others, oblivious to the fact only Roblox could fix me now‚Ä¶.

 Junglle#0896: So the other day, I was playing rainbow six siege, and I heard one of my teammates make a callout in the voice chat. It was a real life gamer girl. God, I kid you not, I just stopped playing and pulled my dick out. ‚Äúfuck, Fuck!‚Äù I was yelling in voice chat. I just wanted to hear her voice again. ‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù I moaned. But she left the lobby. I was crying and covered in my own cum, but I remembered that I could find recent teammates in the ubiplay friends tab. I frantically closed down siege and opened the tab, to find out she had TTV IN HER NAME!!! She was streaming, and only had 100 viewers!!! The competition was low, so I made the first move and donated my months rent to her. I was already about to pre. She read my donation in the chat. God this is the happiest I‚Äôve been in a long time. I did a little research, and found out where she goes to school, but I am a little nervous to talk to her in person, and need support. Any advice before my Uber gets to her middle school?

compared to a stone
which is 14 pounds
and then a ton which is 160 stone
 Alison40#7268: because a kilogram is easier to understand than whatever a "stone" is
 Alison40#7268: imperial is definitely falling out of use here in the younger generation

 Junglle#0896: ‚òπÔ∏è
 Junglle#0896: It‚Äôs the Third Day. I can‚Äôt take this any longer. Roblox has been down for 72 hours and my body cannot handle this copious amount of mental stress. I‚Äôve had numerous seizures from the lack of entertainment and content from Roblox. During the 72 hours I had found myself breathless and unable to speak. No matter how long I sleep I can‚Äôt find the energy to even leave my bed. This is hell. It seems that I won‚Äôt be able to find salvation anytime soon‚Ä¶ I hope that soon enough the Heavens will grace me with Roblox once again and that I can soon see my precious Meeps and Adopt Me pets. I am sure they are starving right now. I can already foresee my fate. I shall collapse under heart failure as I see my PC screen flash: ‚ÄúWe are no longer working on Roblox. Take care. -ROBLOX‚Äù. The sheer weight of that message had doomed me into falling into the endless abyss of boredom. I cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel‚Ä¶ I fear that this may never come to an end. I feel as though that if I don‚Äôt play roblox I would be writhing for the next 10 hours in horrible agony. I may unconsciously harm myself or others if I don‚Äôt receive any entertainment from Roblox right this instant. It‚Äôs now 10 minutes later, I am having frequent blackouts and my sanity is deteriorating. I asked my parents to isolate me in my room so I don‚Äôt cause harm to them in any way. I have also already destroyed my bed. As I cry myself to sleep for the twelfth time since the shutdown, I lay in my annihilated room, my distraught parents seeking help from others, oblivious to the fact only Roblox could fix me now‚Ä¶.

 Junglle#0896: its been 22 hours without Roblox, I can‚Äôt stop shaking and I‚Äôm having severe mental breakdowns. I woke up today trying to log onto Roblox but the site was down, I had a major panic attack but managed to calm down after a few hours. I couldn‚Äôt go to school today, I am so worried that I even took my dads gun from the shed, thinking of killing myself. I am nothing without Roblox, it is my life, it is my destiny, without Roblox, I wouldn't be able to do anything. Roblox is the best thing ever made and I can't get rid of my addiction to it, it is the best game in existence . I can't stop trembling and crying, I am very worried. I used all of my money on Roblox, I bought the Super Super Happy Face and bought a Valkyrie for my girlfriend CoolDjoleProGamerYT. I don't know what to do. Roblox can't be gone for any longer cause if it does then I'll go insane again.. breaking my mouse, chair, house and everything I own. Roblox is very amazing and I can't lose it. Roblox is my life, I met my amazing girlfriend john there, In bloxburg, I was delivering pizza's, when I saw this amazingly attractive woman named, CoolDjoleProGamerYT, she was so cute, I flushed. I found her home later then and tried to talk to her, she was so kind and cute that i accidentally typed my thoughts out "mind: she's so cute.." and she flushed then i got nervous, we then went in and made out, after that we went on many dates to Adopt Me, where we adopted 2 boys named DemonicLuciferr, and RedDoflaming0. Demonic and Red were so cute that I even took them out of town and took them to Brookhaven. after that we had our own child in Bloxburg on our rooftop named lazerlamps. Our kids were so cute and amazing that I even fed them my special milk, they liked it so much that they wanted it again. and the day after... Roblox was down and I went through my panic attack, Shivering in fear of losing my fiance and kids. I am so scared that I might just lose my mind and go insane... I want my kids back...
 BADGER#7138: hes just a cool guy
 Rocketman#0166: I‚Äôm sorry but why does my cousins DOGGO look so chill

 Alison40#7268: the only problem is i need to find a usb stick somewhere
 Coloursplash#9680: I had an arch install with 3 different desktops installed LOL
 Coloursplash#9680: I'm into my 5th installation of arch on my laptop
 Junglle#0896:  tell me
 Coloursplash#9680: TRUE
 Coloursplash#9680: you can literally do anything
 Alison40#7268: but doesn't break every 2 days
 Coloursplash#9680: yeah
 Alison40#7268: rono says it's customisable like arch
 Coloursplash#9680: it's literally arch Linux but not stupid to install
 Coloursplash#9680: Goated distro
 Alison40#7268: I'll learn to use manjaro
 Coloursplash#9680: LESS GO
 Coloursplash#9680: also lose your paid copy of winfoes
 Alison40#7268: I'll just copy my entire c drive into a usb stick
 Coloursplash#9680: when installing Linux you have to wipe your hide drive
 Coloursplash#9680: erm
 Coloursplash#9680: ah
 Alison40#7268: my storage is over half full
 Alison40#7268: well
 Coloursplash#9680: only downside is the limited storage for both os
 Coloursplash#9680: I recommend dual booting for you, where you have windows and Linux installed so can choose at boot which one to use
 Coloursplash#9680: by they'll run fine
 Coloursplash#9680:  you have to put them in the cloud or on a usb than copy them into the new  Linux os
 Coloursplash#9680: your files?
 Coloursplash#9680: what do you mean
 Alison40#7268: from windows
 Alison40#7268:  what happens to your files when you switch to linux

 exorax#9275: proficiency problem
 exorax#9275: competence concern
 CapybaraEater#5386: Fallacious ability
 exorax#9275: attainment argument
 Anonimouse#7272: talent trouble
 Boojer#4612: skill issue
 CapybaraEater#5386:  pc crashed
 BADGER#7138: Among us code?
 exorax#9275: YYOLWH
 Alison40#7268: hello
 I'm tired#3188: Oh
 Anonimouse#7272: now
 exorax#9275: now
 I'm tired#3188: Depends on when
 exorax#9275: oops
 exorax#9275: @everyone
 Anonimouse#7272: nobody's gonna even check chat
 exorax#9275: i think this is a pretty good way to work it out ngl
 Anonimouse#7272: ~~imma be honest we're not gonna be able to get it working~~
 exorax#9275: poll: are we doing jackbox or no
 exorax#9275: high quality emote
 Anonimouse#7272: k bet
 exorax#9275: 9018
 Anonimouse#7272: k bet gimme 3 minutes and the 4 digits on the back of your credit card
 exorax#9275: people are doing apex
 exorax#9275:  idk maybe?
 Anonimouse#7272: oi  ping me when u do jackbox ty
 Obsidian360#0930: cap
 BADGER#7138: Fewer hoppers
 BADGER#7138: You should play mega walls instead
 Obsidian360#0930: i love skywars
 Obsidian360#0930: bhopper on aegis in a corrupted game
 exorax#9275: that's their problem
 BADGER#7138: Also what about current 6 and above stars that are bad
 exorax#9275: so you don't get a gameplay difference there once you hit 6
 exorax#9275: yeah in practice you aren't gonna get to 6 with the <5 matchmaking
 Anonimouse#7272: no but u progress so slow u can stay under 6 forever if u want
 exorax#9275: f
 BADGER#7138: Also I can't Jackbox :(
 BADGER#7138: But as soon as you reach 6 stars the game becomes far less enjoyable, as most games will have a sweat in
 exorax#9275: yeah i can
 Anonimouse#7272: if u can host then bet
 exorax#9275: do people want to jack box in like 15 minutes
 Anonimouse#7272: and then normal queues
 Anonimouse#7272: i would personally say that you could have a mode only accessible to under 5 stars which gives you no xp on kill and 1 on win to learn the game if u actually suck ass
 Anonimouse#7272: ^^
 BADGER#7138: Give people the choice
 BADGER#7138: Add a new mode with sbm, but keep non sbm mode as well
 Anonimouse#7272: you‚Äôd get retards like axelocity death farming for non queues
 Anonimouse#7272: that would end up even more aids
 BADGER#7138: Sbm based on k/d or w/l?
 CapybaraEater#5386: that must be horrible
 CapybaraEater#5386: oh god imagine having to fight those at your level!!!
 Anonimouse#7272: rude but true
 Obsidian360#0930: others of his star level, but of a much higher skill level
 CapybaraEater#5386: exactly
 Anonimouse#7272: LOL!
 CapybaraEater#5386: alex doesn't like it cus it forces him to actually try against others his skill level
 Anonimouse#7272: LOL!
 BADGER#7138: Even if sweats don't like it
 BADGER#7138: Imo skill based matchmaking would help, especially keeping the game alive
 BADGER#7138: Also how tf do you 'fix' SW?
 BADGER#7138: True
 mangerai#0272: hypixel dev team are kinda balls
 mangerai#0272: *if it gets fixed
 Anonimouse#7272: although i expect i will quit before sw gets fixed
 Anonimouse#7272: 34 deaths isnt too bad
 Anonimouse#7272: i can still bring my alts kd back if sw ever gets fixed
 Twontee#1067: also i played on it for a month so stats alt was lots of effort
 Twontee#1067: stats alts are effort
 Anonimouse#7272: servers too shit for me to play on a stats alt rn
 Anonimouse#7272: actually nevermind mine was meant to be one and it never gets used üíÄ

care for the color**** of her skin. The car turned around and drove away, with Bessie‚Äôs
blood dripping on the floor-mat. She was finally admitted to another hospital ‚Ä¶ but she
had lost so much blood that they couldn‚Äôt operate on her, and a little later she died.

 exorax#9275: wine = thing that lets you run windows executables (.exe) on linux systems
libtas = software used for tasing games, only works on linux
xserver = idek, means you can do gui stuff on linux wsl2?
wsl2 = thing that pretends to be linux on a windows system
 BADGER#7138: Bruh what is that in English?
 exorax#9275: (files, not ex-girlfriends)

 Alison40#7268: to control
 Alison40#7268: celeste is just so fun
 Alison40#7268: yeah
 exorax#9275: airwalk op
 exorax#9275: (this is nmms)

 Alison40#7268: like
 exorax#9275: doesnt even need tas
 Alison40#7268: I've seen it
 exorax#9275: like celeste human limits are insane
 Alison40#7268: the demodashes are strong with this one
 Alison40#7268: wheeeee
and then the speedrunners, modders, and tasers
and then some other odd channels with different subcultures
 Alison40#7268: it's like old hkmain with different categories having completely different subcultures
except to the extreme
 Alison40#7268: david you should join celestecord
we have :frogeline:
 exorax#9275: everyone i've talked to pretty much includes exclusively the hollow knight speedrunning server
 Alison40#7268: some say 8c some say 7c
 Alison40#7268: that has no consensus I've found
 exorax#9275: i think 8c is but literally everyone i've talked to has said they found 7c harder
 exorax#9275: also when you get to 7/8c i wanna know which one you find harder
 exorax#9275: problem solved
 exorax#9275: just ping puddi and yellow
 Alison40#7268: yes

 Anonimouse#7272: eh?
 exorax#9275: wouldnt recommend
 Alison40#7268: what I'll probably end up doing is bsides then fw then csides tho
 exorax#9275: yeah good
 Alison40#7268: celestecord has already told me that
 exorax#9275: it's way harder than literally everything else
 Alison40#7268: 8a was fun once i realised you could press jump to go higher off the iceballs
 exorax#9275: also warning: don't do ch9 until every other level
 exorax#9275: 7a is very fun
 Alison40#7268: 7a and 8a are my favourite levels so far
 exorax#9275: 7b is arguably the hardest one
 exorax#9275: they really start ramping up at 5 and 6 imo
 Alison40#7268: yeah
 exorax#9275: 3b is a fair bit harder than 1 and 2
 Alison40#7268: celeste
 Alison40#7268: alex when he forgets i have friend but not puddi

 mangerai#0272: *he‚Äôs still going*
 mangerai#0272: prepare for his fucking thesis
 mangerai#0272: for the last ten minutes chris has been typing in announcements
 mangerai#0272: which was cringe
 mangerai#0272: also when we had equal perms we would just dc everyone from vcs
 mangerai#0272: not a very good track record
 mangerai#0272: as you‚Äôve nuked the server twice
 CapybaraEater#5386: This is a Friend server, we're all equal, why dont we make it that way?
 CapybaraEater#5386: Jeez I could've done some serious damage with that
 CapybaraEater#5386: I made Lucy's name boop
 CapybaraEater#5386: Hmmm
 CapybaraEater#5386: Let's see what I did
 CapybaraEater#5386: I had a role higher than puddi for half a day
 CapybaraEater#5386: There's so many bugs in this server, which I could actually fix, but instead you just take away all our perms so that you don't have to worry about us doing any of the bugs
 Junglle#0896: theres like 5 puddi dupes anyway...
 CapybaraEater#5386: Well fine if you don't want to be able to change roles I'm sure we can just give it to the rest of us
 mangerai#0272: makes sense
 mangerai#0272: ok
 mangerai#0272: then i‚Äôm to blame
 mangerai#0272: so if discord fucks up
 mangerai#0272: your saying that‚Äôs my fault?
 mangerai#0272: and your details are public
 CapybaraEater#5386: Plus they'd then have to find a loophole which none of us have ever found
 mangerai#0272: what happens if there‚Äôs an info leak
 mangerai#0272: how tho
 CapybaraEater#5386: If someone hacks your account then that's just your fault
 mangerai#0272: L
 mangerai#0272: then they could ban everyone
 mangerai#0272: but what if someone hacked into my account
 CapybaraEater#5386: And we're all intelligent enough to know that even if we did nothing would change
 CapybaraEater#5386: But nobody has any reason to ban anyone
 CapybaraEater#5386: If it was public I'd understand
 CapybaraEater#5386: I think you have forgotten that this is a friend discord not an online one
 Junglle#0896: ^^^^
 CapybaraEater#5386: If we did that nothing would change, we'd just get perm banned
 CapybaraEater#5386: Why would we want to ban anyone?
 Coloursplash#9680: we found an exploit that could ban other Puddis and stuff
 CapybaraEater#5386: We could've just done it ourselves
 CapybaraEater#5386: Wait why did we lose role perms?
 mangerai#0272: i‚Äôm smart
 mangerai#0272: oh ok
 mangerai#0272: we don‚Äôt have perms to
 Coloursplash#9680: yeah so DM me the name and exact colour you want for the role
 mangerai#0272: well not really
 CapybaraEater#5386:  yo you can now create custom roles, they aren't shown yet but Chris will make puddi not show soon
 mangerai#0272: i‚Äôm very trustworthy
 mangerai#0272: just give me admin perms
 CapybaraEater#5386: Or we could just do it.....
 Anonimouse#7272: sure, ask chris
 CapybaraEater#5386: We could already do this
 CapybaraEater#5386: Nothing has actually changed
 CapybaraEater#5386: Or we could just do them
 Anonimouse#7272: yea well it‚Äôs chris‚Äô job now
 CapybaraEater#5386: I feel like we could've just done the custom roles ourselves
 CapybaraEater#5386: Oof ok

 CapybaraEater#5386: the closest i was to winning was when a lvl 200 crashed while trying to kill me
 CapybaraEater#5386: i'm getting worse
 CapybaraEater#5386: therefore
 CapybaraEater#5386: all my stats are shit and only getting worse
 CapybaraEater#5386: my kdr is shit
 CapybaraEater#5386: i mean there's no other way to measure it
 Anonimouse#7272: wrong
 Anonimouse#7272: ok but like queues are aids rn due to American holiday
 CapybaraEater#5386: plus i mean w/l is basicaly skill
 CapybaraEater#5386: i'm counting my W/L from solo
 Anonimouse#7272: besides ur w/l is carried by others in teams
 Anonimouse#7272: wtf
 Anonimouse#7272: ur w/l is not ur skill
 Anonimouse#7272: no
 Anonimouse#7272: wut
 CapybaraEater#5386: if i'm getting worse the more i practice then i don't think your logic works
 Anonimouse#7272: same?
 CapybaraEater#5386: my w/l is going down
 Anonimouse#7272: you get better
 Anonimouse#7272: keep going
 Anonimouse#7272: i got 10,000 deaths ruben
 Anonimouse#7272: believe it or not i used to be that iron pres non
 Anonimouse#7272: as you fight more you get better
 Anonimouse#7272: lul wut
 CapybaraEater#5386: i'm not even kidding, i just had over 6 ppl with a higher than 100 level in one game, one of those 6 is guaranteed to win
 CapybaraEater#5386: we quite literally don't
 CapybaraEater#5386: at least you have a chance to beat that final guy
 CapybaraEater#5386: there's a midpoint at which you just kill all the nons then get killed by the nick or lvl 100
 CapybaraEater#5386: the point is we cannot physically get better
 CapybaraEater#5386: yh but that doesn't mean it isn't worse for us
 Anonimouse#7272: oh well w/e
 Anonimouse#7272: i'm meant to maintain a session kd of 10
 Anonimouse#7272: the difference is ur meant to have shit kds
 CapybaraEater#5386: just we can't fight as well
 CapybaraEater#5386: we have to do all that
 CapybaraEater#5386: but you can pvp
 Anonimouse#7272: i have to kill 2 masters players while getting backstabbed by 8 retarded nons who dont understand what dia div is
 Anonimouse#7272: ok
 CapybaraEater#5386: now we then have to kill two more without getting cleaned
 CapybaraEater#5386: before we could just clean one guy
 CapybaraEater#5386: for us it's much worse
 CapybaraEater#5386: exactly while for you it's worse
 Anonimouse#7272: as opposed to the free win it used to be for every single one of us
 Anonimouse#7272: one of them
 CapybaraEater#5386: it's literally a free win for the lvl 300s
 Anonimouse#7272: ok
 CapybaraEater#5386: but you guys do
 CapybaraEater#5386: the point is we have no chance of killing lvl 300sa
 CapybaraEater#5386: YOU THINK AS A LEVEL 36 I WANT TO FIGHT ANYONE ABOVE 60?
 Anonimouse#7272: but with 9 5s str potions around the map
 Anonimouse#7272: that game's a game of rsw
 Anonimouse#7272: u dont understand the game
 Anonimouse#7272: 2 OTHER SWEATS
 Anonimouse#7272: I WANT TO FIGHT
 Anonimouse#7272: YOU THINK
 Anonimouse#7272: THREE
 CapybaraEater#5386: because it's just us nons and three lvl 300s
 CapybaraEater#5386: but hypixel matchmaking is good
 CapybaraEater#5386: i think matchmaking sucks for good players
 Anonimouse#7272: if you think matchmaking is good for good players ur retarded
 Anonimouse#7272: ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
 CapybaraEater#5386: it's great for you because you're actually good at combay
 Anonimouse#7272: NO SHIT???????????

 Obsidian360#0930: thats insane bro
 Obsidian360#0930: ok anyway
 Obsidian360#0930: there's matchmaking?!?!
 Anonimouse#7272: "matchmaking makes queues better for nons"
 CapybaraEater#5386: i can't even kill level 60s let alone 300s
 CapybaraEater#5386: every game i play has at least 2 lvl 300s
 CapybaraEater#5386: i swear to god the level queueing on hypixel isn non-existant

 I'm tired#3188: AITA for telling my girlfriend not to give my penis a nickname?
My girlfriend has chosen a nickname, out of nowhere, for my penis. She has chosen, for some god forsaken reason, to call it 'princess little piddles'. I have no idea where she got this name but it's not the most manly nickname, and honestly, I don't even have a nickname for it so why should she?? Every time she calls it by her nickname, I feel ashamed!
Am I the asshole for making her stop calling it that? Or should I just let her keep it up? I'm afraid this waking nightmare may never end.
UPDATE: I spoke with my girlfriend regarding this nickname fiasco. She informed me that it was not the princess that was little, it was the piddles that were little. That didn't make me feel much better tho.
I offered another nickname, per another user, "princess big and long piddles" but she said that was a mouthful. We compromised on allowing me to pick a nickname for her penis. Thanks everyone.

 CapybaraEater#5386: i like my waffles crispy
 CapybaraEater#5386: the actual nutella takes like 30 seconds
 CapybaraEater#5386: the only reason it takes 5 minutes is cus that's how long it takes to toast
 I'm tired#3188: that takes half a minute
 exorax#9275: so you're effectively making toast but fancy
 CapybaraEater#5386: you have to toast them and then spread nutella on

 Coloursplash#9680: okay lol
 Anonimouse#7272: imma stay deaf for like 5 mins
 Anonimouse#7272:  this is fucken nyooming
 Coloursplash#9680: I made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement, and I don‚Äôt expect to be forgiven. I‚Äôm simply here to apologise.
What we came across in the woods that day was obviously unplanned. The reactions you saw on tape were raw; they were unfiltered. None of us knew how to react or how to feel. I should have never posted the video. I should have put the cameras down and stopped recording what we were going through.
There's a lot of things I should have done differently but I didn't. And for that, from the bottom of my heart, I am sorry. I want to apologise to the internet. I want to apologise to anyone who has seen the video. I want to apologise to anyone who has been affected or touched by mental illness, or depression, or suicide. But most importantly I want to apologise to the victim and his family.
For my fans who are defending my actions, please don't. I don‚Äôt deserve to be defended. My goal with my content is always to entertain; to push the boundaries, to be all-inclusive. In the world live in, I share almost everything I do. The intent is never to be heartless, cruel, or malicious. Like I said I made a huge mistake. I don‚Äôt expect to be forgiven, I‚Äôm just here to apologise. I'm ashamed of myself. I‚Äôm disappointed in myself. And I promise to be better. I will be better. Thank you.

 Boojer#4612: i dont get why you should have more perms than us
 CapybaraEater#5386: the three new one's
 CapybaraEater#5386: hence why general and shitpost and recap
 CapybaraEater#5386: the old ones didn't
 CapybaraEater#5386: the new chats which haven't been properly permed i can edit
 CapybaraEater#5386: not the old ones
 CapybaraEater#5386: cus i can only edit the new ones
 CapybaraEater#5386: that is very wrong
 CapybaraEater#5386: the ability to talk
 CapybaraEater#5386: not to "abuse"
 CapybaraEater#5386: which i did for you
 CapybaraEater#5386: the role did nothing, i already had those perms, the override, again, was to label the broken ones
 Anonimouse#7272: what
 CapybaraEater#5386: it was the perm to edit general
 CapybaraEater#5386: wait no lol
 Anonimouse#7272: which i undid
 CapybaraEater#5386: which you did
 Anonimouse#7272: the permission to create roles did it
 CapybaraEater#5386: your bad perming did all that
 Anonimouse#7272: oh true that did nothing
 CapybaraEater#5386: the role override did legit nothing
 Anonimouse#7272: because i removed it
 CapybaraEater#5386: that was your bad perming
 CapybaraEater#5386: i legit can't
 Anonimouse#7272: because of the fact you can create overrides
 CapybaraEater#5386: other than "displeasing to look at"
 CapybaraEater#5386: still doesn't explain why you took away role perms
 CapybaraEater#5386: he said to do it in general tho
 CapybaraEater#5386: he did
 CapybaraEater#5386: once again, it was David's idea to do the recap thing
 Boojer#4612: you take away everybodys becasue one eprson abused them slightly
 CapybaraEater#5386: nobody
 I'm tired#3188: who takes yours away when you abuse yours?
 CapybaraEater#5386: i made a recap thing
 Anonimouse#7272: you keep finding new ways to abuse dumb shit
 Anonimouse#7272: i take them away when you abuse then
 CapybaraEater#5386: i mean it does
 Anonimouse#7272: yea neither does that
 CapybaraEater#5386: it's a full stop
 CapybaraEater#5386: still doesn't mean anything
 Anonimouse#7272: .
 CapybaraEater#5386: you've slowly taken away our perms because it doesn't effect you
 CapybaraEater#5386: you're just too much of an ass to
 CapybaraEater#5386: at least chris admitted to what he did
 CapybaraEater#5386: you've ruined this discord
 CapybaraEater#5386: it's true
 CapybaraEater#5386: alex just abuses power then makes fun of us

 CapybaraEater#5386: no thats a direct quote
 Anonimouse#7272: how many fallacies r u committing rn holy shit
 CapybaraEater#5386: as you said "it was because i made a role which looked bad"
 Anonimouse#7272: ok
 CapybaraEater#5386: yes
 Anonimouse#7272: ‚Äúno reason‚Äù

 Anonimouse#7272: ?ok lol
 CapybaraEater#5386: don't be a dick
 Anonimouse#7272: ok
 CapybaraEater#5386: that was to point out which ones you could override, which i did for you
 Anonimouse#7272: so it goes
 Anonimouse#7272: it looked annoying
 Anonimouse#7272: yes
 CapybaraEater#5386: you know the override role did nothing right?
 CapybaraEater#5386: you're just irritated that i did the recap
 Anonimouse#7272: which you promptly abused
 Anonimouse#7272: it gave you permission to create overrides
 CapybaraEater#5386: there is literally no reason to take that away
 CapybaraEater#5386:  yo why can't we edit roles?

 CapybaraEater#5386: it does 60 fps
 CapybaraEater#5386: this is a 60hz monitor

 exorax#9275: bc you have to get through that first bit
 exorax#9275: it's by far the hardest one in the game
 exorax#9275: the other fun thing abt euouae is there's a mission that requires you to get 1000 combo on that chart
 Anonimouse#7272: but we‚Äôll go with the first one
 tired#2515: sackboy moment
 Anonimouse#7272: and also he hates black people
 exorax#9275: yeah but he couldn't when that's an average and some sections have like >20
 tired#2515: just use all 10 fingers 5head
 exorax#9275: for reference the second most of any chart is heterochromia iridis with 7.89
 tired#2515: like it hurts
 Anonimouse#7272: ooh sackboy could normal that
 tired#2515: he taps so hard though
 exorax#9275: you literally have to mash the screen when there's (nocap) 9.27 notes a second on average
 Anonimouse#7272: he has 19 pp

 tired#2515: ravon is just not possible
 tired#2515: WTF
 Anonimouse#7272: its not hard i just suck
 exorax#9275: yeah you'd love ravon
 tired#2515: i'm content with the 5 star diff

 tired#2515: when you guys get a few more hours into osu
 Anonimouse#7272: üßá
 tired#2515: understood
 exorax#9275: basically it requires sliding off a wall into chaining fireballs for airtime+knockback into dash wings, then going into and back out of a room transition to set respawn point, hitting some hwurmps, falling into acid to respawn on the other side with full soul, then doing another dash+dash+wings+insanely tight fireball skip
 tired#2515: just not possible for normal humans alr thanks for confirming all hk speedrunners are in fact soldiers from the alien bird colonies
 Anonimouse#7272: umm

 exorax#9275: there's actually a fuck ton of other mag skips that have never been done
 tired#2515: is it absurdly rng
 Anonimouse#7272: mag skip moment
 exorax#9275: and yes it's mag ismas
 exorax#9275: there's one hk skip that only 2 people have done

 mangerai#0272: which is made even more confusing
 mangerai#0272: but there‚Äôs another variable called role specific things
 mangerai#0272: so it‚Äôs actually class based
 mangerai#0272: but you can‚Äôt choose your gender
 mangerai#0272: oh and some equipment is gender specific
 mangerai#0272: and the daily rewards are called benefit payments
 mangerai#0272: kinda sus

 exorax#9275: yeah but we have a system to name every number using other words (e.g. a million million). i would argue that's not a word as such, but we have a way to name every number
 Anonimouse#7272: that is a capybara eating
 Coloursplash#9680: therefore there arent infinite words
 Coloursplash#9680:  stupid
 Coloursplash#9680: yeah but not every number has been named yet
 CapybaraEater#5386: If every number can be expressed as a word and there are infinite numbers, then surely there's infinite words in every language with a basic sense of maths (I had to say that so Chris's friends brother or whoever he was could have his weird as fuck number system)
 CapybaraEater#5386: it's fine

 Coloursplash#9680: Earlier today I was really horny, and I saw what I thought to be a blank dvd. I thought, DVDs have a tight hole, they might feel pretty good. So I put my soft pp into the hole of the DVD, and for a few seconds as I started getting harder, it felt pretty good, but then, once I was fully erect, it started being painful. My pp was stuck in the dvd, and I had to break it in half to get if out. It was then when I flipped the broken dvd over and realized that it was not a blank dvd, but a copy of the movie UP.
Well guys, guess I fucked up.
 Anonimouse#7272: oh no

 CapybaraEater#5386: got this huge tulip order,
and I can't get them anywhere.
No problem, Vannie.
Just leave it to me.
You're a lifesaver, Barry.
Oan I help who's next?
All right, scramble, jocks!
It's time to fly.
Thank you, Barry!
That bee is living my life!
Let it go, Kenny.
- When will this nightmare end?!
- Let it all go.
- Beautiful day to fly.
- Sure is.
Between you and me,
I was dying to get out of that office.
You have got
to start thinking bee, my friend.
- Thinking bee!
- Me?
Hold it. Let's just stop
for a second. Hold it.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone.
Oan we stop here?
I'm not making a major life decision
during a production number!
All right. Take ten, everybody.
Wrap it up, guys.
I had virtually no rehearsal for that.
 CapybaraEater#5386: Nose down. Tail up.
Rotate around it.
- This is insane, Barry!
- This's the only way I know how to fly.
Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane
flying in an insect-like pattern?
Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid.
Smell it. Full reverse!
Just drop it. Be a part of it.
Aim for the center!
Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!
Oome on, already.
Barry, we did it!
You taught me how to fly!
- Yes. No high-five!
- Right.
Barry, it worked!
Did you see the giant flower?
What giant flower? Where? Of course
I saw the flower! That was genius!
- Thank you.
- But we're not done yet.
Listen, everyone!
This runway is covered
with the last pollen
from the last flowers
available anywhere on Earth.
That means this is our last chance.
We're the only ones who make honey,
pollinate flowers and dress like this.
If we're gonna survive as a species,
this is our moment! What do you say?
Are we going to be bees, orjust
Museum of Natural History keychains?
We're bees!
Keychain!
Then follow me! Except Keychain.
Hold on, Barry. Here.
You've earned this.
Yeah!
I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect
fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.
Oh, yeah.
That's our Barry.
Mom! The bees are back!
If anybody needs
to make a call, now's the time.
I got a feeling we'll be
working late tonight!
Here's your change. Have a great
afternoon! Oan I help who's next?
Would you like some honey with that?
It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.
Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me.
And I don't see a nickel!
Sometimes I just feel
like a piece of meat!
I had no idea.
Barry, I'm sorry.
Have you got a moment?
Would you excuse me?
My mosquito associate will help you.
Sorry I'm late.
He's a lawyer too?
I was already a blood-sucking parasite.
All I needed was a briefcase.
Have a great afternoon!
Barry, I just
 CapybaraEater#5386: not!
So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.
All of you, let's get
behind this fellow! Move it out!
Move out!
Our only chance is if I do what I'd do,
you copy me with the wings of the plane!
Don't have to yell.
I'm not yelling!
We're in a lot of trouble.
It's very hard to concentrate
with that panicky tone in your voice!
It's not a tone. I'm panicking!
I can't do this!
Vanessa, pull yourself together.
You have to snap out of it!
You snap out of it.
You snap out of it.
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!
- Hold it!
- Why? Oome on, it's my turn.
How is the plane flying?
I don't know.
Hello?
Benson, got any flowers
for a happy occasion in there?
The Pollen Jocks!
They do get behind a fellow.
- Black and yellow.
- Hello.
All right, let's drop this tin can
on the blacktop.
Where? I can't see anything. Oan you?
No, nothing. It's all cloudy.
Oome on. You got to think bee, Barry.
- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
Wait a minute.
I think I'm feeling something.
- What?
- I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.
Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.
Bring the nose down.
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
- What in the world is on the tarmac?
- Get some lights on that!
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
- Vanessa, aim for the flower.
- OK.
Out the engines. We're going in
on bee power. Ready, boys?
Affirmative!
Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.
Land on that flower!
Ready? Full reverse!
Spin it around!
- Not that flower! The other one!
- Which one?
- That flower.
- I'm aiming at the flower!
That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.
I mean the giant pulsating flower
made of millions of bees!
Pull forward.
 CapybaraEater#5386: copilot.
Not good. Does anyone onboard
have flight experience?
As a matter of fact, there is.
- Who's that?
- Barry Benson.
From the honey trial?! Oh, great.
Vanessa, this is nothing more
than a big metal bee.
It's got giant wings, huge engines.
I can't fly a plane.
- Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?
- Yes.
How hard could it be?
Wait, Barry!
We're headed into some lightning.
This is Bob Bumble. We have some
late-breaking news from JFK Airport,
where a suspenseful scene
is developing.
Barry Benson,
fresh from his legal victory...
That's Barry!
...is attempting to land a plane,
loaded with people, flowers
and an incapacitated flight crew.
Flowers?!
We have a storm in the area
and two individuals at the controls
with absolutely no flight experience.
Just a minute.
There's a bee on that plane.
I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson
and his no-account compadres.
They've done enough damage.
But isn't he your only hope?
Technically, a bee
shouldn't be able to fly at all.
Their wings are too small...
Haven't we heard this a million times?
"The surface area of the wings
and body mass make no sense."
- Get this on the air!
- Got it.
- Stand by.
- We're going live.
The way we work may be a mystery to you.
Making honey takes a lot of bees
doing a lot of small jobs.
But let me tell you about a small job.
If you do it well,
it makes a big difference.
More than we realized.
To us, to everyone.
That's why I want to get bees
back to working together.
That's the bee way!
We're not made of Jell-O.
We get behind a fellow.
- Black and yellow!
- Hello!
Left, right, down, hover.
- Hover?
- Forget hover.
This isn't so hard.
Beep-beep! Beep-beep!
Barry, what happened?!
Wait, I think we were
on autopilot the whole time.
- That may have been helping me.
- And now we're
 CapybaraEater#5386: - Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.
- I'm getting the marshal.
You do that!
This whole parade is a fiasco!
Let's see what this baby'll do.
Hey, what are you doing?!
Then all we do
is blend in with traffic...
...without arousing suspicion.
Once at the airport,
there's no stopping us.
Stop! Security.
- You and your insect pack your float?
- Yes.
Has it been
in your possession the entire time?
Would you remove your shoes?
- Remove your stinger.
- It's part of me.
I know. Just having some fun.
Enjoy your flight.
Then if we're lucky, we'll have
just enough pollen to do the job.
Oan you believe how lucky we are? We
have just enough pollen to do the job!
I think this is gonna work.
It's got to work.
Attention, passengers,
this is Oaptain Scott.
We have a bit of bad weather
in New York.
It looks like we'll experience
a couple hours delay.
Barry, these are cut flowers
with no water. They'll never make it.
I gotta get up there
and talk to them.
Be careful.
Oan I get help
with the Sky Mall magazine?
I'd like to order the talking
inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.
Oaptain, I'm in a real situation.
- What'd you say, Hal?
- Nothing.
Bee!
Don't freak out! My entire species...
What are you doing?
- Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!
- Who's an attorney?
Don't move.
Oh, Barry.
Good afternoon, passengers.
This is your captain.
Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B
please report to the cockpit?
And please hurry!
What happened here?
There was a DustBuster,
a toupee, a life raft exploded.
One's bald, one's in a boat,
they're both unconscious!
- Is that another bee joke?
- No!
No one's flying the plane!
This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.
What's your status?
This is Vanessa Bloome.
I'm a florist from New York.
Where's the pilot?
He's unconscious,
and so is the
 CapybaraEater#5386: going.
I had to open my mouth and talk.
Vanessa?
Vanessa? Why are you leaving?
Where are you going?
To the final Tournament of Roses parade
in Pasadena.
They've moved it to this weekend
because all the flowers are dying.
It's the last chance
I'll ever have to see it.
Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.
I never meant it to turn out like this.
I know. Me neither.
Tournament of Roses.
Roses can't do sports.
Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?
Roses!
Vanessa!
Roses?!
Barry?
- Roses are flowers!
- Yes, they are.
Flowers, bees, pollen!
I know.
That's why this is the last parade.
Maybe not.
Oould you ask him to slow down?
Oould you slow down?
Barry!
OK, I made a huge mistake.
This is a total disaster, all my fault.
Yes, it kind of is.
I've ruined the planet.
I wanted to help you
with the flower shop.
I've made it worse.
Actually, it's completely closed down.
I thought maybe you were remodeling.
But I have another idea, and it's
greater than my previous ideas combined.
I don't want to hear it!
All right, they have the roses,
the roses have the pollen.
I know every bee, plant
and flower bud in this park.
All we gotta do is get what they've got
back here with what we've got.
- Bees.
- Park.
- Pollen!
- Flowers.
- Repollination!
- Across the nation!
Tournament of Roses,
Pasadena, Oalifornia.
They've got nothing
but flowers, floats and cotton candy.
Security will be tight.
I have an idea.
Vanessa Bloome, FTD.
Official floral business. It's real.
Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.
Thank you. It was a gift.
Once inside,
we just pick the right float.
How about The Princess and the Pea?
I could be the princess,
and you could be the pea!
Yes, I got it.
- Where should I sit?
- What are you?
- I believe I'm the pea.
- The pea?
It goes under the mattresses.
 CapybaraEater#5386: Shut down honey production!
Stop making honey!
Turn your key, sir!
What do we do now?
Oannonball!
We're shutting honey production!
Mission abort.
Aborting pollination and nectar detail.
Returning to base.
Adam, you wouldn't believe
how much honey was out there.
Oh, yeah?
What's going on? Where is everybody?
- Are they out celebrating?
- They're home.
They don't know what to do.
Laying out, sleeping in.
I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way
to San Antonio with a cricket.
At least we got our honey back.
Sometimes I think, so what if humans
liked our honey? Who wouldn't?
It's the greatest thing in the world!
I was excited to be part of making it.
This was my new desk. This was my
new job. I wanted to do it really well.
And now...
Now I can't.
I don't understand
why they're not happy.
I thought their lives would be better!
They're doing nothing. It's amazing.
Honey really changes people.
You don't have any idea
what's going on, do you?
- What did you want to show me?
- This.
What happened here?
That is not the half of it.
Oh, no. Oh, my.
They're all wilting.
Doesn't look very good, does it?
No.
And whose fault do you think that is?
You know, I'm gonna guess bees.
Bees?
Specifically, me.
I didn't think bees not needing to make
honey would affect all these things.
It's notjust flowers.
Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.
That's our whole SAT test right there.
Take away produce, that affects
the entire animal kingdom.
And then, of course...
The human species?
So if there's no more pollination,
it could all just go south here,
couldn't it?
I know this is also partly my fault.
How about a suicide pact?
How do we do it?
- I'll sting you, you step on me.
- Thatjust kills you twice.
Right, right.
Listen, Barry...
sorry, but I gotta get
 CapybaraEater#5386: nature intended for us?
To be forcibly addicted
to smoke machines
and man-made wooden slat work camps?
Living out our lives as honey slaves
to the white man?
- What are we gonna do?
- He's playing the species card.
Ladies and gentlemen, please,
free these bees!
Free the bees! Free the bees!
Free the bees!
Free the bees! Free the bees!
The court finds in favor of the bees!
Vanessa, we won!
I knew you could do it! High-five!
Sorry.
I'm OK! You know what this means?
All the honey
will finally belong to the bees.
Now we won't have
to work so hard all the time.
This is an unholy perversion
of the balance of nature, Benson.
You'll regret this.
Barry, how much honey is out there?
All right. One at a time.
Barry, who are you wearing?
My sweater is Ralph Lauren,
and I have no pants.
- What if Montgomery's right?
- What do you mean?
We've been living the bee way
a long time, 27 million years.
Oongratulations on your victory.
What will you demand as a settlement?
First, we'll demand a complete shutdown
of all bee work camps.
Then we want back the honey
that was ours to begin with,
every last drop.
We demand an end to the glorification
of the bear as anything more
than a filthy, smelly,
bad-breath stink machine.
We're all aware
of what they do in the woods.
Wait for my signal.
Take him out.
He'll have nauseous
for a few hours, then he'll be fine.
And we will no longer tolerate
bee-negative nicknames...
But it's just a prance-about stage name!
...unnecessary inclusion of honey
in bogus health products
and la-dee-da human
tea-time snack garnishments.
Oan't breathe.
Bring it in, boys!
Hold it right there! Good.
Tap it.
Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,
and there's gallons more coming!
- I think we need to shut down!
- Shut down? We've never shut down.
 CapybaraEater#5386: and then...
and then ecstasy!
All right.
You think it was all a trap?
Of course. I'm sorry.
I flew us right into this.
What were we thinking? Look at us. We're
just a couple of bugs in this world.
What will the humans do to us
if they win?
I don't know.
I hear they put the roaches in motels.
That doesn't sound so bad.
Adam, they check in,
but they don't check out!
Oh, my.
Oould you get a nurse
to close that window?
- Why?
- The smoke.
Bees don't smoke.
Right. Bees don't smoke.
Bees don't smoke!
But some bees are smoking.
That's it! That's our case!
It is? It's not over?
Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.
Get back to the court and stall.
Stall any way you can.
And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.
Mr. Flayman.
Yes? Yes, Your Honor!
Where is the rest of your team?
Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.
Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,
and as a result,
we don't make very good time.
I actually heard a funny story about...
Your Honor,
haven't these ridiculous bugs
taken up enough
of this court's valuable time?
How much longer will we allow
these absurd shenanigans to go on?
They have presented no compelling
evidence to support their charges
against my clients,
who run legitimate businesses.
I move for a complete dismissal
of this entire case!
Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going
to have to consider
Mr. Montgomery's motion.
But you can't! We have a terrific case.
Where is your proof?
Where is the evidence?
Show me the smoking gun!
Hold it, Your Honor!
You want a smoking gun?
Here is your smoking gun.
What is that?
It's a bee smoker!
What, this?
This harmless little contraption?
This couldn't hurt a fly,
let alone a bee.
Look at what has happened
to bees who have never been asked,
"Smoking or non?"
Is this what
 CapybaraEater#5386: is to remind them
of what they don't like about bees.
- You got the tweezers?
- Are you allergic?
Only to losing, son. Only to losing.
Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you
what I think we'd all like to know.
What exactly is your relationship
to that woman?
We're friends.
- Good friends?
- Yes.
How good? Do you live together?
Wait a minute...
Are you her little...
...bedbug?
I've seen a bee documentary or two.
From what I understand,
doesn't your queen give birth
to all the bee children?
- Yeah, but...
- So those aren't your real parents!
- Oh, Barry...
- Yes, they are!
Hold me back!
You're an illegitimate bee,
aren't you, Benson?
He's denouncing bees!
Don't y'all date your cousins?
- Objection!
- I'm going to pincushion this guy!
Adam, don't! It's what he wants!
Oh, I'm hit!!
Oh, lordy, I am hit!
Order! Order!
The venom! The venom
is coursing through my veins!
I have been felled
by a winged beast of destruction!
You see? You can't treat them
like equals! They're striped savages!
Stinging's the only thing
they know! It's their way!
- Adam, stay with me.
- I can't feel my legs.
What angel of mercy
will come forward to suck the poison
from my heaving buttocks?
I will have order in this court. Order!
Order, please!
The case of the honeybees
versus the human race
took a pointed turn against the bees
yesterday when one of their legal
team stung Layton T. Montgomery.
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.
- Is there much pain?
- Yeah.
I...
I blew the whole case, didn't I?
It doesn't matter. What matters is
you're alive. You could have died.
I'd be better off dead. Look at me.
They got it from the cafeteria
downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.
Look, there's
a little celery still on it.
What was it like to sting someone?
I can't explain it. It was all...
All adrenaline
 CapybaraEater#5386: that was all right.
I'm going to drain the old stinger.
Yeah, you do that.
Look at that.
You know, I've just about had it
with your little mind games.
- What's that?
- Italian Vogue.
Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.
A lot of ads.
Remember what Van said, why is
your life more valuable than mine?
Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!
I think something stinks in here!
I love the smell of flowers.
How do you like the smell of flames?!
Not as much.
Water bug! Not taking sides!
Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!
This is pathetic!
I've got issues!
Well, well, well, a royal flush!
- You're bluffing.
- Am I?
Surf's up, dude!
Poo water!
That bowl is gnarly.
Except for those dirty yellow rings!
Kenneth! What are you doing?!
You know, I don't even like honey!
I don't eat it!
We need to talk!
He's just a little bee!
And he happens to be
the nicest bee I've met in a long time!
Long time? What are you talking about?!
Are there other bugs in your life?
No, but there are other things bugging
me in life. And you're one of them!
Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...
My nerves are fried from riding
on this emotional roller coaster!
Goodbye, Ken.
And for your information,
I prefer sugar-free, artificial
sweeteners made by man!
I'm sorry about all that.
I know it's got
an aftertaste! I like it!
I always felt there was some kind
of barrier between Ken and me.
I couldn't overcome it.
Oh, well.
Are you OK for the trial?
I believe Mr. Montgomery
is about out of ideas.
We would like to call
Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.
Good idea! You can really see why he's
considered one of the best lawyers...
Yeah.
Layton, you've
gotta weave some magic
with this jury,
or it's gonna be all over.
Don't worry. The only thing I have
to do to turn this jury around
 CapybaraEater#5386: Sumner!
That's not his real name?! You idiots!
Mr. Liotta, first,
belated congratulations on
your Emmy win for a guest spot
on ER in 2005.
Thank you. Thank you.
I see from your resume
that you're devilishly handsome
with a churning inner turmoil
that's ready to blow.
I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?
Not yet it isn't. But is this
what it's come to for you?
Exploiting tiny, helpless bees
so you don't
have to rehearse
your part and learn your lines, sir?
Watch it, Benson!
I could blow right now!
This isn't a goodfella.
This is a badfella!
Why doesn't someone just step on
this creep, and we can all go home?!
- Order in this court!
- You're all thinking it!
Order! Order, I say!
- Say it!
- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!
I think it was awfully nice
of that bear to pitch in like that.
I think the jury's on our side.
Are we doing everything right, legally?
I'm a florist.
Right. Well, here's to a great team.
To a great team!
Well, hello.
- Ken!
- Hello.
I didn't think you were coming.
No, I was just late.
I tried to call, but... the battery.
I didn't want all this to go to waste,
so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.
Oh, that was lucky.
There's a little left.
I could heat it up.
Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.
So I hear you're quite a tennis player.
I'm not much for the game myself.
The ball's a little grabby.
That's where I usually sit.
Right... there.
Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,
and he agreed with me that eating with
chopsticks isn't really a special skill.
You think I don't see what you're doing?
I know how hard it is to find
the rightjob. We have that in common.
Do we?
Bees have 100 percent employment,
but we do jobs like taking the crud out.
That's just what
I was thinking about doing.
Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor
for his fuzz. I hope
 CapybaraEater#5386: Ventriloquism!
Oloning! For all we know,
he could be on steroids!
Mr. Benson?
Ladies and gentlemen,
there's no trickery here.
I'm just an ordinary bee.
Honey's pretty important to me.
It's important to all bees.
We invented it!
We make it. And we protect it
with our lives.
Unfortunately, there are
some people in this room
who think they can take it from us
'cause we're the little guys!
I'm hoping that, after this is all over,
you'll see how, by taking our honey,
you not only take everything we have
but everything we are!
I wish he'd dress like that
all the time. So nice!
Oall your first witness.
So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden
of Honey Farms, big company you have.
I suppose so.
I see you also own
Honeyburton and Honron!
Yes, they provide beekeepers
for our farms.
Beekeeper. I find that
to be a very disturbing term.
I don't imagine you employ
any bee-free-ers, do you?
- No.
- I couldn't hear you.
- No.
- No.
Because you don't free bees.
You keep bees. Not only that,
it seems you thought a bear would be
an appropriate image for a jar of honey.
They're very lovable creatures.
Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.
You mean like this?
Bears kill bees!
How'd you like his head crashing
through your living room?!
Biting into your couch!
Spitting out your throw pillows!
OK, that's enough. Take him away.
So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.
Your name intrigues me.
- Where have I heard it before?
- I was with a band called The Police.
But you've never been
a police officer, have you?
No, I haven't.
No, you haven't. And so here
we have yet another example
of bee culture casually
stolen by a human
for nothing more than
a prance-about stage name.
Oh, please.
Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?
Because I'm feeling
a little stung, Sting.
Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M.
 CapybaraEater#5386: Bees must hate those fake things!
Nothing worse
than a daffodil that's had work done.
Maybe this could make up
for it a little bit.
- This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.
- I guess.
You sure you want to go through with it?
Am I sure? When I'm done with
the humans, they won't be able
to say, "Honey, I'm home,"
without paying a royalty!
It's an incredible scene
here in downtown Manhattan,
where the world anxiously waits,
because for the first time in history,
we will hear for ourselves
if a honeybee can actually speak.
What have we gotten into here, Barry?
It's pretty big, isn't it?
I can't believe how many humans
don't work during the day.
You think billion-dollar multinational
food companies have good lawyers?
Everybody needs to stay
behind the barricade.
- What's the matter?
- I don't know, I just got a chill.
Well, if it isn't the bee team.
You boys work on this?
All rise! The Honorable
Judge Bumbleton presiding.
All right. Oase number 4475,
Superior Oourt of New York,
Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry
is now in session.
Mr. Montgomery, you're representing
the five food companies collectively?
A privilege.
Mr. Benson... you're representing
all the bees of the world?
I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,
we're ready to proceed.
Mr. Montgomery,
your opening statement, please.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
my grandmother was a simple woman.
Born on a farm, she believed
it was man's divine right
to benefit from the bounty
of nature God put before us.
If we lived in the topsy-turvy world
Mr. Benson imagines,
just think of what would it mean.
I would have to negotiate
with the silkworm
for the elastic in my britches!
Talking bee!
How do we know this isn't some sort of
holographic motion-picture-capture
Hollywood wizardry?
They could be using laser beams!
Robotics!
 CapybaraEater#5386: on Hexagon.
Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.
Did you ever think, "I'm a kid
from the hive. I can't do this"?
Bees have never been afraid
to change the world.
What about Bee Oolumbus?
Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?
Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.
We were thinking
of stickball or candy stores.
How old are you?
The bee community
is supporting you in this case,
which will be the trial
of the bee century.
You know, they have a Larry King
in the human world too.
It's a common name. Next week...
He looks like you and has a show
and suspenders and colored dots...
Next week...
Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the
guest even though you just heard 'em.
Bear Week next week!
They're scary, hairy and here live.
Always leans forward, pointy shoulders,
squinty eyes, very Jewish.
In tennis, you attack
at the point of weakness!
It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.
Honey, her backhand's a joke!
I'm not gonna take advantage of that?
Quiet, please.
Actual work going on here.
- Is that that same bee?
- Yes, it is!
I'm helping him sue the human race.
- Hello.
- Hello, bee.
This is Ken.
Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size
ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.
Why does he talk again?
Listen, you better go
'cause we're really busy working.
But it's our yogurt night!
Bye-bye.
Why is yogurt night so difficult?!
You poor thing.
You two have been at this for hours!
Yes, and Adam here
has been a huge help.
- Frosting...
- How many sugars?
Just one. I try not
to use the competition.
So why are you helping me?
Bees have good qualities.
And it takes my mind off the shop.
Instead of flowers, people
are giving balloon bouquets now.
Those are great, if you're three.
And artificial flowers.
- Oh, those just get me psychotic!
- Yeah, me too.
Bent stingers, pointless pollination.
 CapybaraEater#5386: That's a drag queen!
What is this?
Oh, no!
There's hundreds of them!
Bee honey.
Our honey is being brazenly stolen
on a massive scale!
This is worse than anything bears
have done! I intend to do something.
Oh, Barry, stop.
Who told you humans are taking
our honey? That's a rumor.
Do these look like rumors?
That's a conspiracy theory.
These are obviously doctored photos.
How did you get mixed up in this?
He's been talking to humans.
- What?
- Talking to humans?!
He has a human girlfriend.
And they make out!
Make out? Barry!
We do not.
- You wish you could.
- Whose side are you on?
The bees!
I dated a cricket once in San Antonio.
Those crazy legs kept me up all night.
Barry, this is what you want
to do with your life?
I want to do it for all our lives.
Nobody works harder than bees!
Dad, I remember you
coming home so overworked
your hands were still stirring.
You couldn't stop.
I remember that.
What right do they have to our honey?
We live on two cups a year. They put it
in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!
Even if it's true, what can one bee do?
Sting them where it really hurts.
In the face! The eye!
- That would hurt.
- No.
Up the nose? That's a killer.
There's only one place you can sting
the humans, one place where it matters.
Hive at Five, the hive's only
full-hour action news source.
No more bee beards!
With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.
Weather with Storm Stinger.
Sports with Buzz Larvi.
And Jeanette Ohung.
- Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble.
- And I'm Jeanette Ohung.
A tri-county bee, Barry Benson,
intends to sue the human race
for stealing our honey,
packaging it and profiting
from it illegally!
Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,
we'll have three former queens here in
our studio, discussing their new book,
Olassy Ladies,
out this week
 CapybaraEater#5386: chance, bee!
Why does everything have
to be so doggone clean?!
How much do you people need to see?!
Open your eyes!
Stick your head out the window!
From NPR News in Washington,
I'm Oarl Kasell.
But don't kill no more bugs!
- Bee!
- Moose blood guy!!
- You hear something?
- Like what?
Like tiny screaming.
Turn off the radio.
Whassup, bee boy?
Hey, Blood.
Just a row of honey jars,
as far as the eye could see.
Wow!
I assume wherever this truck goes
is where they're getting it.
I mean, that honey's ours.
- Bees hang tight.
- We're all jammed in.
It's a close community.
Not us, man. We on our own.
Every mosquito on his own.
- What if you get in trouble?
- You a mosquito, you in trouble.
Nobody likes us. They just smack.
See a mosquito, smack, smack!
At least you're out in the world.
You must meet girls.
Mosquito girls try to trade up,
get with a moth, dragonfly.
Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.
You got to be kidding me!
Mooseblood's about to leave
the building! So long, bee!
- Hey, guys!
- Mooseblood!
I knew I'd catch y'all down here.
Did you bring your crazy straw?
We throw it in jars, slap a label on it,
and it's pretty much pure profit.
What is this place?
A bee's got a brain
the size of a pinhead.
They are pinheads!
Pinhead.
- Oheck out the new smoker.
- Oh, sweet. That's the one you want.
The Thomas 3000!
Smoker?
Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic.
Twice the nicotine, all the tar.
A couple breaths of this
knocks them right out.
They make the honey,
and we make the money.
"They make the honey,
and we make the money"?
Oh, my!
What's going on? Are you OK?
Yeah. It doesn't last too long.
Do you know you're
in a fake hive with fake walls?
Our queen was moved here.
We had no choice.
This is your queen?
That's a man in women's clothes!
 CapybaraEater#5386: Ray Liotta Private Select?
- Is he that actor?
- I never heard of him.
- Why is this here?
- For people. We eat it.
You don't have
enough food of your own?
- Well, yes.
- How do you get it?
- Bees make it.
- I know who makes it!
And it's hard to make it!
There's heating, cooling, stirring.
You need a whole Krelman thing!
- It's organic.
- It's our-ganic!
It's just honey, Barry.
Just what?!
Bees don't know about this!
This is stealing! A lot of stealing!
You've taken our homes, schools,
hospitals! This is all we have!
And it's on sale?!
I'm getting to the bottom of this.
I'm getting to the bottom
of all of this!
Hey, Hector.
- You almost done?
- Almost.
He is here. I sense it.
Well, I guess I'll go home now
and just leave this nice honey out,
with no one around.
You're busted, box boy!
I knew I heard something.
So you can talk!
I can talk.
And now you'll start talking!
Where you getting the sweet stuff?
Who's your supplier?
I don't understand.
I thought we were friends.
The last thing we want
to do is upset bees!
You're too late! It's ours now!
You, sir, have crossed
the wrong sword!
You, sir, will be lunch
for my iguana, Ignacio!
Where is the honey coming from?
Tell me where!
Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!
Orazy person!
What horrible thing has happened here?
These faces, they never knew
what hit them. And now
they're on the road to nowhere!
Just keep still.
What? You're not dead?
Do I look dead? They will wipe anything
that moves. Where you headed?
To Honey Farms.
I am onto something huge here.
I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood,
crazy stuff. Blows your head off!
I'm going to Tacoma.
- And you?
- He really is dead.
All right.
Uh-oh!
- What is that?!
- Oh, no!
- A wiper! Triple blade!
- Triple blade?
Jump on! It's your only
 CapybaraEater#5386: talking to you.
Martin, would you talk to him?
Barry, I'm talking to you!
You coming?
Got everything?
All set!
Go ahead. I'll catch up.
Don't be too long.
Watch this!
Vanessa!
- We're still here.
- I told you not to yell at him.
He doesn't respond to yelling!
- Then why yell at me?
- Because you don't listen!
I'm not listening to this.
Sorry, I've gotta go.
- Where are you going?
- I'm meeting a friend.
A girl? Is this why you can't decide?
Bye.
I just hope she's Bee-ish.
They have a huge parade
of flowers every year in Pasadena?
To be in the Tournament of Roses,
that's every florist's dream!
Up on a float, surrounded
by flowers, crowds cheering.
A tournament. Do the roses
compete in athletic events?
No. All right, I've got one.
How come you don't fly everywhere?
It's exhausting. Why don't you
run everywhere? It's faster.
Yeah, OK, I see, I see.
All right, your turn.
TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?
That's insane!
You don't have that?
We have Hivo, but it's a disease.
It's a horrible, horrible disease.
Oh, my.
Dumb bees!
You must want to sting all those jerks.
We try not to sting.
It's usually fatal for us.
So you have to watch your temper.
Very carefully.
You kick a wall, take a walk,
write an angry letter and throw it out.
Work through it like any emotion:
Anger, jealousy, lust.
Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?
Yeah.
- What is wrong with you?!
- It's a bug.
He's not bothering anybody.
Get out of here, you creep!
What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?
Yeah, it was. How did you know?
It felt like about 10 pages.
Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.
You've really got that
down to a science.
- I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
- I'll bet.
What in the name
of Mighty Hercules is this?
How did this get here?
Oute Bee, Golden Blossom,
 CapybaraEater#5386: Poodle.
You did it, and I'm glad. You saw
whatever you wanted to see.
You had your "experience." Now you
can pick out yourjob and be normal.
- Well...
- Well?
Well, I met someone.
You did? Was she Bee-ish?
- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
- No, no, no, not a wasp.
- Spider?
- I'm not attracted to spiders.
I know it's the hottest thing,
with the eight legs and all.
I can't get by that face.
So who is she?
She's... human.
No, no. That's a bee law.
You wouldn't break a bee law.
- Her name's Vanessa.
- Oh, boy.
She's so nice. And she's a florist!
Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!
We're not dating.
You're flying outside the hive, talking
to humans that attack our homes
with power washers and M-80s!
One-eighth a stick of dynamite!
She saved my life!
And she understands me.
This is over!
Eat this.
This is not over! What was that?
- They call it a crumb.
- It was so stingin' stripey!
And that's not what they eat.
That's what falls off what they eat!
- You know what a Oinnabon is?
- No.
It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.
They heat it up...
Sit down!
...really hot!
- Listen to me!
We are not them! We're us.
There's us and there's them!
Yes, but who can deny
the heart that is yearning?
There's no yearning.
Stop yearning. Listen to me!
You have got to start thinking bee,
my friend. Thinking bee!
- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
There he is. He's in the pool.
You know what your problem is, Barry?
I gotta start thinking bee?
How much longer will this go on?
It's been three days!
Why aren't you working?
I've got a lot of big life decisions
to think about.
What life? You have no life!
You have no job. You're barely a bee!
Would it kill you
to make a little honey?
Barry, come out.
Your father's
 CapybaraEater#5386: wedding is on.
And he says, "Watermelon?
I thought you said Guatemalan.
Why would I marry a watermelon?"
Is that a bee joke?
That's the kind of stuff we do.
Yeah, different.
So, what are you gonna do, Barry?
About work? I don't know.
I want to do my part for the hive,
but I can't do it the way they want.
I know how you feel.
- You do?
- Sure.
My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or
a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.
- Really?
- My only interest is flowers.
Our new queen was just elected
with that same campaign slogan.
Anyway, if you look...
There's my hive right there. See it?
You're in Sheep Meadow!
Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!
No way! I know that area.
I lost a toe ring there once.
- Why do girls put rings on their toes?
- Why not?
- It's like putting a hat on your knee.
- Maybe I'll try that.
- You all right, ma'am?
- Oh, yeah. Fine.
Just having two cups of coffee!
Anyway, this has been great.
Thanks for the coffee.
Yeah, it's no trouble.
Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,
I'd be up the rest of my life.
Are you...?
Oan I take a piece of this with me?
Sure! Here, have a crumb.
- Thanks!
- Yeah.
All right. Well, then...
I guess I'll see you around.
Or not.
OK, Barry.
And thank you
so much again... for before.
Oh, that? That was nothing.
Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...
This can't possibly work.
He's all set to go.
We may as well try it.
OK, Dave, pull the chute.
- Sounds amazing.
- It was amazing!
It was the scariest,
happiest moment of my life.
Humans! I can't believe
you were with humans!
Giant, scary humans!
What were they like?
Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.
They eat crazy giant things.
They drive crazy.
- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
- Some of them. But some of them don't.
- How'd you get back?
-
 CapybaraEater#5386: What would I say?
I could really get in trouble.
It's a bee law.
You're not supposed to talk to a human.
I can't believe I'm doing this.
I've got to.
Oh, I can't do it. Oome on!
No. Yes. No.
Do it. I can't.
How should I start it?
"You like jazz?" No, that's no good.
Here she comes! Speak, you fool!
Hi!
I'm sorry.
- You're talking.
- Yes, I know.
You're talking!
I'm so sorry.
No, it's OK. It's fine.
I know I'm dreaming.
But I don't recall going to bed.
Well, I'm sure this
is very disconcerting.
This is a bit of a surprise to me.
I mean, you're a bee!
I am. And I'm not supposed
to be doing this,
but they were all trying to kill me.
And if it wasn't for you...
I had to thank you.
It's just how I was raised.
That was a little weird.
- I'm talking with a bee.
- Yeah.
I'm talking to a bee.
And the bee is talking to me!
I just want to say I'm grateful.
I'll leave now.
- Wait! How did you learn to do that?
- What?
The talking thing.
Same way you did, I guess.
"Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up.
- That's very funny.
- Yeah.
Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh,
we'd cry with what we have to deal with.
Anyway...
Oan I...
...get you something?
- Like what?
I don't know. I mean...
I don't know. Ooffee?
I don't want to put you out.
It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.
- It's just coffee.
- I hate to impose.
- Don't be ridiculous!
- Actually, I would love a cup.
Hey, you want rum cake?
- I shouldn't.
- Have some.
- No, I can't.
- Oome on!
I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.
- Where?
- These stripes don't help.
You look great!
I don't know if you know
anything about fashion.
Are you all right?
No.
He's making the tie in the cab
as they're flying up Madison.
He finally gets there.
He runs up the steps into the church.
The
 CapybaraEater#5386: unbelievable.
I gotta get home.
Oan't fly in rain.
Oan't fly in rain.
Oan't fly in rain.
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!
Ken, could you close
the window please?
Ken, could you close
the window please?
Oheck out my new resume.
I made it into a fold-out brochure.
You see? Folds out.
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.
What was that?
Maybe this time. This time. This time.
This time! This time! This...
Drapes!
That is diabolical.
It's fantastic. It's got all my special
skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.
What's number one? Star Wars?
Nah, I don't go for that...
...kind of stuff.
No wonder we shouldn't talk to them.
They're out of their minds.
When I leave a job interview, they're
flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.
There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.
I don't remember the sun
having a big 75 on it.
I predicted global warming.
I could feel it getting hotter.
At first I thought it was just me.
Wait! Stop! Bee!
Stand back. These are winter boots.
Wait!
Don't kill him!
You know I'm allergic to them!
This thing could kill me!
Why does his life have
less value than yours?
Why does his life have any less value
than mine? Is that your statement?
I'm just saying all life has value. You
don't know what he's capable of feeling.
My brochure!
There you go, little guy.
I'm not scared of him.
It's an allergic thing.
Put that on your resume brochure.
My whole face could puff up.
Make it one of your special skills.
Knocking someone out
is also a special skill.
Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.
- Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
- Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.
- You could put carob chips on there.
- Bye.
- Supposed to be less calories.
- Bye.
I gotta say something.
She saved my life.
I gotta say something.
All right, here it goes.
Nah.
 CapybaraEater#5386: of you, drain those flowers!
Wow! I'm out!
I can't believe I'm out!
So blue.
I feel so fast and free!
Box kite!
Wow!
Flowers!
This is Blue Leader.
We have roses visual.
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.
Roses!
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.
Stand to the side, kid.
It's got a bit of a kick.
That is one nectar collector!
- Ever see pollination up close?
- No, sir.
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it
over here. Maybe a dash over there,
a pinch on that one.
See that? It's a little bit of magic.
That's amazing. Why do we do that?
That's pollen power. More pollen, more
flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.
Oool.
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.
Oould be daisies. Don't we need those?
Oopy that visual.
Wait. One of these flowers
seems to be on the move.
Say again? You're reporting
a moving flower?
Affirmative.
That was on the line!
This is the coolest. What is it?
I don't know, but I'm loving this color.
It smells good.
Not like a flower, but I like it.
Yeah, fuzzy.
Ohemical-y.
Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby.
My sweet lord of bees!
Oandy-brain, get off there!
Problem!
- Guys!
- This could be bad.
Affirmative.
Very close.
Gonna hurt.
Mama's little boy.
You are way out of position, rookie!
Ooming in at you like a missile!
Help me!
I don't think these are flowers.
- Should we tell him?
- I think he knows.
What is this?!
Match point!
You can start packing up, honey,
because you're about to eat it!
Yowser!
Gross.
There's a bee in the car!
- Do something!
- I'm driving!
- Hi, bee.
- He's back here!
He's going to sting me!
Nobody move. If you don't move,
he won't sting you. Freeze!
He blinked!
Spray him, Granny!
What are you doing?!
Wow... the tension level
out here is
 CapybaraEater#5386: opened up again.
What happened?
A bee died. Makes an opening. See?
He's dead. Another dead one.
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.
Dead from the neck up.
Dead from the neck down. That's life!
Oh, this is so hard!
Heating, cooling,
stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,
humming, inspector number seven,
lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,
mite wrangler. Barry, what
do you think I should... Barry?
Barry!
All right, we've got the sunflower patch
in quadrant nine...
What happened to you?
Where are you?
- I'm going out.
- Out? Out where?
- Out there.
- Oh, no!
I have to, before I go
to work for the rest of my life.
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?
Another call coming in.
If anyone's feeling brave,
there's a Korean deli on 83rd
that gets their roses today.
Hey, guys.
- Look at that.
- Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?
Sign here, here. Just initial that.
- Thank you.
- OK.
You got a rain advisory today,
and as you all know,
bees cannot fly in rain.
So be careful. As always,
watch your brooms,
hockey sticks, dogs,
birds, bears and bats.
Also, I got a couple of reports
of root beer being poured on us.
Murphy's in a home because of it,
babbling like a cicada!
- That's awful.
- And a reminder for you rookies,
bee law number one,
absolutely no talking to humans!
All right, launch positions!
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,
buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!
Black and yellow!
Hello!
You ready for this, hot shot?
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.
Wind, check.
- Antennae, check.
- Nectar pack, check.
- Wings, check.
- Stinger, check.
Scared out of my shorts, check.
OK, ladies,
let's move it out!
Pound those petunias,
you striped stem-suckers!
All
 CapybaraEater#5386: buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?
I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.
Hey, Honex!
Dad, you surprised me.
You decide what you're interested in?
- Well, there's a lot of choices.
- But you only get one.
Do you ever get bored
doing the same job every day?
Son, let me tell you about stirring.
You grab that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.
You know, Dad,
the more I think about it,
maybe the honey field
just isn't right for me.
You were thinking of what,
making balloon animals?
That's a bad job
for a guy with a stinger.
Janet, your son's not sure
he wants to go into honey!
- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
- I'm not trying to be funny.
You're not funny! You're going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!
- You're gonna be a stirrer?
- No one's listening to me!
Wait till you see the sticks I have.
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!
Let's open some honey and celebrate!
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
Shave my antennae.
Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!
I'm so proud.
- We're starting work today!
- Today's the day.
Oome on! All the good jobs
will be gone.
Yeah, right.
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
stirrer, front desk, hair removal...
- Is it still available?
- Hang on. Two left!
One of them's yours! Oongratulations!
Step to the side.
- What'd you get?
- Picking crud out. Stellar!
Wow!
Oouple of newbies?
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!
Make your choice.
- You want to go first?
- No, you go.
Oh, my. What's available?
Restroom attendant's open,
not for the reason you think.
- Any chance of getting the Krelman?
- Sure, you're on.
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.
Wax monkey's always open.
The Krelman
 CapybaraEater#5386: only have
to make one decision in life.
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?
Why would you question anything?
We're bees.
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.
You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?
Like what? Give me one example.
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.
Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.
Wait a second. Oheck it out.
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.
I've never seen them this close.
They know what it's like
outside the hive.
Yeah, but some don't come back.
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!
You guys did great!
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!
- I wonder where they were.
- I don't know.
Their day's not planned.
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.
You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.
Right.
Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?
Distant. Distant.
Look at these two.
- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
- Let's have fun with them.
It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!
He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!
- Oh, my!
- I never thought I'd knock him out.
What were you doing during this?
Trying to alert the authorities.
I can autograph that.
A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?
Yeah. Gusty.
We're hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.
- Six miles, huh?
- Barry!
A puddle jump for us,
but maybe you're not up for it.
- Maybe I am.
- You are not!
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.
What do you think,
 CapybaraEater#5386: of...
...9:15.
That concludes our ceremonies.
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!
Will we pick ourjob today?
I heard it's just orientation.
Heads up! Here we go.
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.
- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A little scary.
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco
and a part of the Hexagon Group.
This is it!
Wow.
Wow.
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.
Our top-secret formula
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured
into this soothing sweet syrup
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...
Honey!
- That girl was hot.
- She's my cousin!
- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.
- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.
- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.
- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know
that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.
But choose carefully
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.
What's the difference?
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off
in 27 million years.
So you'll just work us to death?
We'll sure try.
Wow! That blew my mind!
"What's the difference?"
How can you say that?
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.
I'm relieved. Now we
 CapybaraEater#5386: Bee Movie Script - Dialogue Transcript
According to all known laws
of aviation,
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.
The bee, of course, flies anyway
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.
Barry! Breakfast is ready!
Ooming!
Hang on a second.
Hello?
- Barry?
- Adam?
- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.
Looking sharp.
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.
Sorry. I'm excited.
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.
A perfect report card, all B's.
Very proud.
Ma! I got a thing going here.
- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.
- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.
Never thought I'd make it.
Three days grade school,
three days high school.
Those were awkward.
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.
You did come back different.
- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.
That's why we don't need vacations.
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.
- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!
- Bee-men.
- Amen!
Hallelujah!
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.
Welcome, New Hive Oity

 mangerai#0272: May I, a woman respecting and feminist-supportive male, see at least one breast from you my queen? I do not mean to come on as an improper male, and if this request disturbs you, please make me aware. You, my queen, deserve the utmost respect of any female. However, many of my gender seem to sexualize women and view them as sex toys. However, my Queen, I do not share these views. Rather, I value the female spectrum of the human race as the superior, and I, a respectful male, request for the viewing of an isolated, singular breast from your body. I await your response my Queen.

 mangerai#0272: anime
 Anonimouse#7272: wtf copypasta is that
 mangerai#0272: Anime is a weaponized form of autism developed in the 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs by post war Japanese imperial loyalists. The objective was to destabilize the United States by rendering its male youth socially awkward and weak. This was to be accomplished by distracting them from more physical, social, and outdoor activities. The anime would assault their still plastic minds with addictive flashy colors, unrealistic body types (big tiddy amine girls) and ridiculous scenarios. The plan has been successful to an impressive degree, however the beautifully unanticipated backfiring effect has been devastating for populations of Japan and Korea, resulting in a plummeting of birth rates, weak and doughy fighting age males and an excess of those creepy cafes where the girls dress like preteen cartoons, then stand and talk like they really have to pee. Many of these observations have been made first hand.

 exorax#9275: theres definitely a better start
 exorax#9275: yea
 Alison40#7268: and we should find a fairer board
 Alison40#7268: but it's still slightly winning for p1
 Alison40#7268: i guess that's true
 BADGER#7138: cool
 exorax#9275: i can do 4p
 Anonimouse#7272: but i can
 Anonimouse#7272: its glitchy as fuck
 Anonimouse#7272: i can use webclient
 Anonimouse#7272: wait 
 Anonimouse#7272: i want to dropkick tom
 Anonimouse#7272: im on a phone
 Anonimouse#7272: i can‚Äôt play 4p lol
 BADGER#7138: about to do it
 BADGER#7138: exist?
 BADGER#7138: we were doing 4 player with bot
 Anonimouse#7272: we are?
 BADGER#7138: yes
 Anonimouse#7272: guessing he‚Äôs ig so  tell him
 Anonimouse#7272: are we chess.com friends?
 Anonimouse#7272:  gimme 5 mins and i will chess you
 exorax#9275: i will absolutely watch you playing chess
 exorax#9275: also 2x2 start is still viable bc 1. it's not actually massively winning for first player since block into build other side and 2. second player can block off start
 Junglle#0896: u better watch thoe
 Junglle#0896: HELL YEAH
 exorax#9275: it'd be funny
 exorax#9275:  you should stream chess on twitch
 Alison40#7268: 2x2 start is bust
 Alison40#7268: which gives them a lead anyway
 Alison40#7268: which allows another move in the centre by p1
 Alison40#7268: then the only way to stop it is blocking the diagonal
 Alison40#7268: play in any square move 1
 Junglle#0896: how
 Alison40#7268: i figured out they can almost force it
 Alison40#7268: hey
you know how pizza opening is winning for p1
 CapybaraEater#5386: like jesus christ, took me five seconds to notice that, why did they still make it?
 CapybaraEater#5386: mojang has done a fat dumb
 CapybaraEater#5386: but why?

 Calcium#2969: Wow I'm so popular
 BADGER#7138: Some of the main reasons as to why I would like to become an employee of KFC is that I am absolutely passionate about 2 things. Firstly, the main one is supporting the local community in as many ways as possible. Working at KFC would allow me to encourage members of the town and community (especially at the old people‚Äôs home) to buy some delicious KFC more than they do already. The second thing that I am passionate about is not starving to death. To help accomplish this, I wish to earn a decent amount of money which will enable me to acquire food for eating. Should this fail, I will just nick some finger-lickin‚Äô good food from the kitchen to allow me to eat, and therefore continue working with the squad.. Another reason as to why I want to work at KFC is that my family have worked at various KFC‚Äôs for at least 5 generations, and I strongly wish to continue that tradition. I have also proven my loyalty to the company by recently purchasing the KFConsole, as shown on the left. Me and my friends always play Star Wars Battlefront 2 and Hypixel Skywars whIlst enjoying the sweet taste of the original recipe vegan burger.
