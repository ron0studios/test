 ron0studios#4591: !scrape 50000
 Ian Mykl#4218: ~~just submit early~~
 almyki#2368: Even if itch could theoretically build that support, questionable how worth it it would be if it is only needed for one hour out of the year each year lol
 NitramiuZ#4145: Yeah good luck finding a better server
 almyki#2368: It takes money and infrastructure to support such spikes of high traffic.
 ProfessorSil#3107: I feel like moving to another server is only going to make the problem worse. There's no way Mark would be able to afford the infrastructure needed to support the jam upload hours.
 CadenJO [DM to trade ratings]#2365: im bored send me ur games if you wanna trade ratings
 dhafo#4640: it's pretty much always gonna crash 😭
 Penguinmanereikel#3708: Should we try the next GMTK Game Jam on its own website so that itch doesn’t crash on us last minute again?
 wyrm_slayr#7477: Ohhh, cool.
The reason I asked is because my team's game happens to have a kind of similar mechanic.
 domjanabi#9370: 😔  lol
 paulhdh#6428: if anyone wants their html games played dm me
 dhafo#4640: like being able to spec into this build or that build, like in a pick 3 u could do a crit stack or health stack etc
 Prince_S#4199: Thank you everyone!
 wyrm_slayr#7477: So like you collect a dice build by buying stuff or something and use them?
 DangerNoodle#5924: Hello! I'm trying your games giving honest and not biased (as much as I can) feedback. You can send them to me in DM! :D
 Kira#7896: Check  and jump into some streams. Great way to get feedback *and* show off your game
 ProfessorSil#3107: I think if you spend time playing and commenting on other people's games they will often play and review your game as well
 dhafo#4640: have u tried roll defender
 Prince_S#4199: Thank you! Now I'm worried we're just not getting enough traction. Any tips for reaching out?
 wyrm_slayr#7477: Wdym by "builds"?
 RoyalNobody#9379: How does Itch.io's ranking algorithm work?
Itch.io takes into account the number of ratings a game receives to ensure that things remain fair . The exact nature of this algorithm is not made public knowledge.
 dhafo#4640: but like a pick 3 roguelike can have what i'm talking about too maybe builds is the wrong word idk
 Woahsea#4308: i think it takes into account other factors, such as who gave the rating and how many ratings a game received
 dhafo#4640: maybe 2 i guess
 dhafo#4640: i get it but i did find 1 lol
 Prince_S#4199: Hey everyone! Does anyone know how the rankings work? Is it games with most ratings that get to the top- or what if a game has 1 rating, but is scored 5/5/5?
 wyrm_slayr#7477: Builds?
 Scolon#4218: I think something like that would be hard to find, considering the time constranit
 dhafo#4640: has anyone tried a game where u can like make diff builds, i only ran into 1 so far
 dhafo#4640: imma try this pip factory
 Lighted#2578: i wish pip factory had more content >_<
 dhafo#4640: no the clickbait memey one
 Scolon#4218: pip factory?
 dhafo#4640: i am now playing the clicker game
 Lighted#2578: yeye
 cathy#3897: yeah but youre still able to add images to your itch page you just cant change the actual game
 Scolon#4218: There's a big warning yeah
 LethalChicken#3001: Yep lol
I love how there's even a confirmation popup
 Lighted#2578: At the last hours of the Jam itch.io photo importing broke, and people now delete their pages probably to put their images or somethin like that
 Scolon#4218: There are always people making huge mistakes every year
It's probably posts in  that caused it
 vlady.ts#4296: Send me a DM if you want and I rate your game 😄
 LethalChicken#3001: I wonder what prompted that message in 
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: tasty, but a bit sparky
 Toliman#7817: If someone want I can try and rate their game (DM) 🙂
 domjanabi#9370: frustration, despair, and pride
 macleodian#7269: G-Fuel
 NalaFala38290#9305: what does game flavored jam taste like
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: fruity
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: no once each but you can share you game in DMs or put it in your bio
 Scolon#4218: mmm game juice
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: learning how to do a grappling hook thing in godot, always wanted to try this out... now to figure out how to make this go from "working" to "good feeling"
 syelan34#3258: sure that works
 SaadTheGlad#9716: I'm gonna dm you ok?
 Supuh#0468: Want to throw my hat in the ring for the game-swapping thing. Feel free to DM me your games!
 syelan34#3258: where?
 SaadTheGlad#9716: I would like to make the font much larger
 syelan34#3258: sure, what is it?
 SaadTheGlad#9716: Could you help me in something?
 syelan34#3258: a decent bit
 CadenJO [DM to trade ratings]#2365: W
 SaadTheGlad#9716: Does anybody have experience with css in itch.io here?
 Fiki#6850: omg yes xD same colors
 Gumy#7061: icup
 NalaFala38290#9305: up is a movie
 akaBl4ck#7384: what's up people
 domjanabi#9370: lol  our games look alike
 macleodian#7269: If we've already posted once in  , are we allowed to post in there again?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: No you are unable to upload new files at the moment, they will be available again after the jam ends
 PlatosMan#2789: My bad. Again, if anyone wants their games reviewed, feel free to DM me.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Put your games in  or swap through DMs, not links to your own game here thank you
 Lukey#6052: Yeah people stop posting game links
 Scolon#4218: 
 Spico#6316: delete all game so no jam :trollskull:
lets bother 6k people with something they dont want to do!
 6746#9763: Its not a game breaking bug or anything, just a bug that's bothering me.
 Cameron#7818: That said, deleting your game is possible but I advise heavily against that.
 Spico#6316: make change now, upload after jams done
 Cameron#7818: Edits are completely banned.
It is actually physically impossible for you to edit your game right now.
 Scolon#4218: I mean, don't worry about it lol
Even if it somehow places high Mark and others have final say over placements
 Spico#6316: sir your pfp is most exquisite
 6746#9763: I was wondering, can I fix bugs in the code during the submission period without adding new content is are edits just completely banned?
 wyrm_slayr#7477: ***Nice***
 macleodian#7269: Dice!? In my game jam!? 😱
 MetalGearSamus#0001: It's a roll of the dice, you could say
 masalt#5723: hehe
 syelan34#3258: It is kind of unique tbh, I didn't see anyone have a similar mechanic. Basically you can move variable distances but there's no check as to if there's a path to that location, so you can just teleport over gaps.
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: I would have thought the mod team and Mark bounced around ideas until they settled on one
 keb#6637: dice???????
 FryDev#0372: apparently him and his wife said phrases to each other until they got something
 Spico#6316: self note addiction practices use definitely
 SpellCast#5277: How do Mark and the mods come up with the theme? Just curious
 Spico#6316: 196 people voted for it jesus christ
 Digitaldude555#5515: nah keep it.
 Spico#6316: wtf
 macleodian#7269: As a wise man once said, "It just works"
 Lukey#6052: It's not a bug, it's a feature B]
 Spico#6316: (we dont talk about it) no lazy programming here hmm
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: I'm tempted to cause of how much I hate my "Game"
 syelan34#3258: I'm 90% done doing that, I want to make it more obvious that one mechanic is intended and not from lazy programming (it totally is trust me)
 octartis#5305: noice
 Scolon#4218: ayo
 6746#9763: Exquisite
 Spico#6316: 👀 HELL YEA
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: exciting
 Mark Brown#6982: I'm off! Aiming to start streaming games on Wednesday. All the relevant details will be on this Discord closer to the start of the stream
 6746#9763: 12th June 2012
 Amitgep#9295: mario
 Spico#6316: bird
 Lukey#6052: new zealand
 Draconium🪁#9786: kiwi
 MaverickHorn#2838: I am curious now, send me your link
 Spico#6316: i should start on fixing my game tomorrow
reorganization, fixing around 5 bugs that people found
 Valkyrrii#3264: Nah since like. A lotta the time it’s all stuff the person _knows_ about due to lack of time in the gamejam.
 masalt#5723: anybody else wanna play/rate mine? people have liked it a lot so far
 6746#9763: among us 😹 😱
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: maybe in a more polished game but I feel like in a game jam you want some sort of critique even if it's something really simple
 Cameron#7818: scroll up in 
 keb#6637: really? lol
 masalt#5723: me luck 🥺 🙏
 DangerNoodle#5924: Does anyone want to play mine? It's a top down shooter with some nice pixel art :3
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Things happen, mistakes are made
 Valkyrrii#3264: Yeah I feel like _unasked_ for critique is something a lotta people don’t want to do. Hell, I’m careful with it. But if you _want_ it I’ll 100% do an analysis.
 6746#9763: wish me luck
 Cameron#7818: Nobody knows but it keeps happening.
 subwave [Rolling Dice]#0193: * agrees in unison *
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: that.... is a question
 6746#9763: I'm aiming for the top 2000's
 masalt#5723: reveiw my game brutally honest
 CadenJO [DM to trade ratings]#2365: W
 Toliman#7817: If someone want I can try and rate their game (DM) 🙂
 honiemun#0001: the button looks extra dangerous and I'm all about living life on the edge
 syelan34#3258: ehh the only reason i get kind of annoyed at some feedback is that every single one says the exact same thing and never acknowledges that everyone else has said it too
 subwave [Rolling Dice]#0193: No worries, my bad.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: its ok we just don't want the channel filled with game links and no conversation
 keb#6637: why would anyone even try to delete their game
 Spico#6316: 6 if i could
 masalt#5723: nintendo game jam when
 StormyRise#2632: Cool ... Thank you very much for the answers.
I played games that already had over 20 ratings. I started to worry 😅
 Valkyrrii#3264: You can also yell at me for honest feedback. Choose your level of critique.
 subwave [Rolling Dice]#0193: Yup sorry I will delete. Oh its gone
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: Anyone else enjoying just sitting here and watching the chat roll past?
 Spico#6316: if its not the quality of a AAA game i give 1 star (joke)
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: 
 DangerNoodle#5924: Hello! I'm trying your games giving honest and not biased (as much as I can) feedback. You can send them to me in DM! :D
 Squishy Turtle#3988: boom gone
 Vedal#1437: median is 6 so 8 is good
 Spico#6316: send link
ill gam e
 subwave [Rolling Dice]#0193: You can review my game (and be at the other endpoint of advertising from now).
 Spico#6316: i got like 3 of them
famous we are
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: Apparently I got 1 view that came from the Itch homepage. Not sure how that happened
 mattkingz#6689: ohhhh thanks thanks!!
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: should be on the median
 dhafo#4640: also for some reason ur game didnt work in firefox for me
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: if you go to the jam submissions page you can filter by games you have rated
 Squishy Turtle#3988: oops it's fixed now
 Cameron#7818: PSA: Do **not** delete your games! They cannot be brought back once you confirm the deletion.
 Spico#6316: d ude
 Beeg scarf#3571: Submissions > have rated
 Tyrix#6647: i am at 35 ratings i think i can start to chill with the advertising, what do you think?
 Valkyrrii#3264: I’ve got 8-9 rn and that’s only since I’ve been vocal. I’ll prolly have 20 by the time this is over.
 dhafo#4640: oh for some reason i cant dm u
 Lukey#6052: Remember, playing other games gives you karma which makes your game more likely to be shown to people :D
 Spico#6316: yes
 Vedal#1437: the median number of ratings is 6
 mattkingz#6689: quick question, can i see all the ratings i gave on itch?
 Beeg scarf#3571: its doing average
 Scolon#4218: If you want to get can accurate read on your game you need more
But yeah it's only been 24 hours since the submissions ended
 Ian Mykl#4218: Just think: the next random game you play could be the best in jam that just no one noticed
 Valkyrrii#3264: Nah you’re fine there’s lots of time.
 dhafo#4640: im about to play yours lol but sure i'll dm it
 subwave [Rolling Dice]#0193: 4 gang here
 Spico#6316: heyy todays only the first day
 Digitaldude555#5515: 6 days left
 StormyRise#2632: So my game with only 8 ... it is not doing very well ... right? 😕
 Squishy Turtle#3988: DM me your game! :D
 Scolon#4218: But yes there are a lot of unknown gems that probably won't be noticed until mark makes his video
They'll get the attention they deserve later
 dhafo#4640: 20 is where i'd at least like to end up
 Valkyrrii#3264: But the game _was_ very obviously broken and I made it clear I wasn’t in the running lol
 Ian Mykl#4218: Just hit 20 as it happens, insert mini celebration with myself here
 Spico#6316: for more than 20 you kinda have to get inmense steam from an outside source, or get extremely lucky
 Scolon#4218: If you have 20+ ratings you're good (in this case)
 Valkyrrii#3264: I got like 5 ratings last year, including one that rated it 3/15 before the submission period was over.
 Squishy Turtle#3988: badpiggy's a good friend of mine ^^ he always makes great stuff
 dhafo#4640: i'm confused on what u are asking lol
 wastedfox#0295: Guys, what is the golden number of ratings in your opinion? 40-50?
 Amitgep#9295: last year what was the lowest rates on the submissions with the least ratings?
 dhafo#4640: ok now that i see u i will actually play ur game lol (only game with a bunch of ratings ive tried so far has been piggy's cause he's a minijammer)
 Squishy Turtle#3988: yeah usually some of the best rate games are relatively unknown gems
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: ratings aren't visible until the voting closes
 Valkyrrii#3264: ^^
 Ian Mykl#4218: We don't know what the most well rated games are
 Draconium🪁#9786: did someone post the top ten most well-rated games ?
 Digitaldude555#5515: guys these mythical trolls dont exist, unless you have enemies in this discord no one is gonna put 1 star on your 3 star game.
 Valkyrrii#3264: I don’t know how much info the gmtk allows but mass rating things  3/15 across the board would prolly be noticeable at least.
 Squishy Turtle#3988: I would prefer it if people would spend time on the least rated games cause we definitely have enough raters to get 20 to each game by the end
 Ian Mykl#4218: There was at least one person copy and pasting the same review (that ended with asking you to check out their game) on a butch of games
 syelan34#3258: I did too, I don’t even know if they’ve played it though
 dhafo#4640: i can't even check to see if that's a thing for me cause i shared my game with my nonjammer friends
 syelan34#3258: But then there’s also not much they could do to prevent that
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yeah don't even joke about this. We hope this community is better than that
 syelan34#3258: Yeah that’s kind of stupid
 dhafo#4640: although technically trolls can still vote without playing ur game lolol
 Toliman#7817: If someone want I can try and rate their game (DM) 🙂
 unityAccount#7810: Since people struggle to get their games rated, I guess it's a good thing for a game to be popular
 dhafo#4640: it's not a popularity contest or w/e
 Digitaldude555#5515: my game is replayable btw you can win
 dhafo#4640: if you're only concerned with winning, it's kind of a gatekeep for votes
 Amitgep#9295: wydm?
 dhafo#4640: honestly a downloadable only might be an advantage
 Squishy Turtle#3988: a lot of ratings doesn't mean they're good ratings 🙃  My game still has plenty of issues
 unityAccount#7810:  congrats on first place so far in ratings
 dhafo#4640: prob would have been able to win in that case lolol
 dhafo#4640: oh i thought u NEEDED it to be empty
 johanhelsing#7237: I guess discord really is the internet's black hole of information
 Digitaldude555#5515: the cards are blank or your dice are blank? cause sometimes the cards are blank means you only need to match one symbol, its free points
 dhafo#4640: sometimes it'll be like - O - or O - -
 Squishy Turtle#3988: aw darn
 Digitaldude555#5515: clear what dice?
 johanhelsing#7237: I wanted to make a blog post, but didn't save my progress pics, so guess they're gone now :/
 CoolRyan#6539: all the memories gone like that 😭
 Squishy Turtle#3988: there shall be no more progress
 Scolon#4218: Lol that's an old reply, only mark knows.
But he confirmed it won't be today or tomorrow
 johanhelsing#7237: what happened to the progresssharing channel?
 Jorvan#4669: When? 👀
 dhafo#4640: so is there a way to clear the dice
 Delphine Noel#1196: I meant in a game jam
 SaadTheGlad#9716: Good negative feedback imo is constructive criticism
 SaadTheGlad#9716: Not really
 DangerNoodle#5924: Hello! I'm trying your games giving honest and not biased (as much as I can) feedback. You can send them to me in DM! :D
 dhafo#4640: i dont think i can legit win this lol
 Digitaldude555#5515: you must enhance your vision
 dhafo#4640: also  i cant keep track of these shapes lmao
 Delphine Noel#1196: You would mostly get that from someone who doesn't makes games
 Digitaldude555#5515: It would have been a top 100 game if it had a webgl build
 dhafo#4640: it's been surprisingly hard to find like any remotely negative feedback lol
 Light Maker 🍧#8953: Aye
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: yep, I'd love to see it
 dhafo#4640:  omg i like ur comment
 Light Maker 🍧#8953: Well we were sadly unable to finish it, it was a bit too ambitious. But we do have a...'playable' build? There's not really much gameplay. Got a working main menu and you can kinda do movement stuff. Still interested in seeing it?
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: What game did you make for the jam? Can you DM it to me?
 krisis in a jar#0904: Same lmao, i've been coding for about 5 years and this was my first released game
 z00mm00z#2058: I might do that, it would be a nice break from the mess my procedural animation system is in 😅
 Pixelcore#9371: Nice!
 krisis in a jar#0904: I've rated 50 games already, only 6,141 left!11!!
 Light Maker 🍧#8953: By the way, if any of you are looking to join a team for a more permanent basis, or just wanna help out in making a bigger game, I'm always looking for help! Wanna lighten the load of all my boys. -v- DM me if your interested guys.
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: Construct 3 uses it for Desktop builds, although on Windows they're testing using Microsoft Edge Webview 2,
 The Tasty Jaffa#1678: Not what I ment to reply to
 Tyler Hunter#0474: Its that time again,  Review trade.
 Digitaldude555#5515: power of game jam
 The Tasty Jaffa#1678: Yeah, true for other jam-like events
 Squishy Turtle#3988: thats the hard part XD
 Ian Mykl#4218: Yeah, I have a really and habit of experimenting endlessly with the engine but never making a finished product. It feels weird that after like 7 years of game deving I made my best work in 48 hours
 octartis#5305: eeeew NW.js ... 🤢
 Delphine Noel#1196: That's exactly what I learned this time, and I actually have a game lol
 Mukhavertolet#2243: now it's time to learn to plan things properly and make structured code and not mess
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: similar concept, different people behind it
 Powercore2000#0189: biggest takeaway I still get from jams
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: Electron is NodeJS + Chromium, and no, actually most tended to use NW.js (Node Webkit)
 BlankSlate#8922: Jams are great for stopping new devs from overscoping that was a hard lesson I had to learn when starting out
 Delphine Noel#1196: 🦧
 Squishy Turtle#3988: that's great to hear! jams are the best practice for learning to finish games
 octartis#5305: you mean Electron?
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: I'm making a Visual Novel engine cause most of them rely on 50MB of Bloat (aka Chromium, the open-source version of Chrome)
 Galactum#6235: Honestly im super glad i participated in this jam, it gave me the motivation to spend time on an actual game
 octartis#5305: I'm making pong for fun
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: I’m planning on remaking an old one
 Light Maker 🍧#8953: Now that all this game jam stuff has passed, I should start getting back to work on my real game.
 Light Maker 🍧#8953: Well
 Vyllan#3241: but if its temporary/recoverable...heheheh
 pibolib#2222: somehow the jam fixed my sleep schedule (for its duration)
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: ^
 Uthel#6594: Yep for sure. I should be back to a normal schedule soon - the lingering fuzziness was unexpected, it's been many years since ive done a big grind, I'm getting old I guess 😛
 wren#0640: rolls and trolls was really neat, i like that they took the standard you are a dice rolling puzzle and turned it into a way to attack enemies
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: why not still try and make it? you can't submit it, but it will still be a fun challenge.
 octartis#5305: yeah I had "Jamhover" 😄
 dhafo#4640: accidently downloaded the same game twice 😭
 Alex Silva#8787: what is the name of ur game? I'll review it to ur migraine worth it
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: Please make sure you get plenty of sleep now that the jam is over
 Mukhavertolet#2243: i always get it after 12 hours sleep, nothing unusual
 z00mm00z#2058: I wish I had had time to do the jam. I had a cool idea too
 Vyllan#3241: my favorite so far has been this one called pip factory and it was like this idle game, super satisfying
 Uthel#6594: no but im still mildly delirious from staying up for 41 hours 😛
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: yep
 ⲟⲩⲥⲓⲣⲉ#2058: Did anyone else wake up with a migraine after the jam?
 wren#0640: ooh what game?
 Delphine Noel#1196: have a red bull
 Alex Silva#8787: i didn't spent my energy so... yeah lol
 dhafo#4640: bro i didnt even get my energy back yet from the last one 😭
 Draconium🪁#9786: Jeez I just rated one that was incredible
 Alex Silva#8787: someone waiting for GMTK 2023? 🙂
 Delphine Noel#1196: You know I just watched rick and morty for the first time. It's awesome
 Mukhavertolet#2243: i'm doing well
how many games rated how many ratings got
 Toliman#7817: If someone want I will try and rate their game (DM) 🙂
 Delphine Noel#1196: great wby
 Mukhavertolet#2243: hey everyone how's it going
 syelan34#3258: Yeah I realized that’s not a good idea
 birdstone#3073: this is the first time i've witness the chat go silent like this
 Delphine Noel#1196: yeah
 masalt#5723: shenanigans
 Delphine Noel#1196: Yo
 masalt#5723: be
 dhafo#4640:  ok my b i got a call during ur game but i'll actually review it now lol
 Amitgep#9295: b
 masalt#5723: fixed thanks
 macleodian#7269: Just a heads up that the link in the about me is broken, it has a b at the end
 masalt#5723: not funny (didnt laugh)
 Thomas Boone#6137: and mine too please, it ain't much, but it's honest work
 masalt#5723: ;
 Michel#2879: compiler error you put a semicolon in middle of statsment
 masalt#5723: if anybody is actively rating games;
rate my game! it's in my about me and status! rate my game!!!!!! 🤣 🗿 😭 💀
 masalt#5723: brainfuck derivatives 💀
 Thomas Boone#6137: alright, thx 😎
 LOPSTERu#3902: now 6 days
 Michel#2879:  let's not talk about esoteric languages
 masalt#5723: a week
 Thomas Boone#6137: just a random question, don't know if it has been answered already, but when does the voting stop?
 masalt#5723: ive made multiple
 Toboter#5206: I actually made a game in Brainfuck once.
 masalt#5723: as in Look! My ascension orb!
 NalaFala38290#9305: i made an esoteric language
 masalt#5723: i like befunge
 Michel#2879: lmao as in London's maintainable agricultural origins?
 macleodian#7269: The Shakespeare one is just mind boggling to me with how it works lol, but I personally like Ook! because return to monke 🐒
 masalt#5723: 2 hours 40 minutes before deadline
 domjanabi#9370: same, but i thought the _reason_ behind the no cover image was not that it broke, but that it wasn't a priority
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: Checked 30 Minutes after the jam ended and I could not even open the itch.io page
 Amitgep#9295: I uploaded it 4 minutes before the deadline 💀
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: I almost couldn't upload my game at all
 domjanabi#9370: true, were they really having issues tho?
like apart from the obvious issues
i thought they turned off uploading cover images to prioritise getting people's uploads up
 Scolon#4218: You can't
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: yes, but yesterday itch was having issues and I don't think they realized that adding one later was an option
 Digitaldude555#5515: someone else asked and was told it was against the rules
 Draconium🪁#9786: How do I see the top games in the jam
 Redline#7370: no rule against it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: sure, but you have a6 hour timer
 Chazi b#4006: Also there's a 6hour slomode
 domjanabi#9370: 🧐 isn't it up to them to post some?
 masalt#5723: esoteric* (lmao)
 Digitaldude555#5515: no
 macleodian#7269: Btw if we already posted our game once in  are we allowed to post it again? (If it's been a while of course)
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: I'm very sorry for the people without cover images
 Michel#2879: I like erotic language
there's also a language called Shakespear which just look like Shakespear plays
 masalt#5723: what
 Melwing#3159: Anyone else's comments double (or triple) posting today? (on itch)
 masalt#5723: javascrapped
 macleodian#7269: Yesterday I learned there's a technique called jsf*ck, which is just using JavaScript but in the most broken way 💀
 hzzzln#7656: Nice, glad you had a moment of pride and accomplishment 😎 🆒
 JIBUS#8140: thats what i though
 NalaFala38290#9305: people managed to download my game even though I only posted an HTML build
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: review channel please
 Valkyrrii#3264: ^^^
 masalt#5723: 
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: 
 JIBUS#8140: heeyyyy, if i post my game here, is someone here gonna play it ? just asking 😅
 Falcon#3043: pitch up, pitch down untill it sounds like something
 Scolon#4218: Yeah your ctr should go down
1%+ ctr is high and usually only happens in game jams
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: mine doubled somehow
 masalt#5723: just punch and flick things
 NalaFala38290#9305: my ctr went down
 LOPSTERu#3902: typed it wrong
 Michel#2879: I assume they are the type of people who would code in brainfuck
 Falcon#3043: wha
 Beeg scarf#3571: no, there are 22k participants
 masalt#5723: sound effects are easy
 LOPSTERu#3902: there are 22k that entered
 Falcon#3043: there is currently 6,191 Entries vs 61,9k ratings nice 1/10
 paulhdh#6428: I got 20 minutes left before i gotta go. If anyone has HTML games they want played and rated dm me
 Powercore2000#0189: haha ha, the answers a lot 🙃  Although honestly my management skills got a lot better lol
 Beeg scarf#3571: keep in mind more rates doesnt mean better score, for that you have Most karma
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: people do that? In 48h? How much does one have to hate himself
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: some (quite a few) of them are good
 Michel#2879: And if u r a masochist go to "help rate unrated submissions" and scroll all the way down
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: I thought the community rated kinda fairly, but seeing a cat and ninja in third place is making me second guess that
 Powercore2000#0189: did anyone work on multipul submissions this time around?
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: why are memes top rated
 chegusta(nikola)#7094: will do, thanks for the offer!
 Beeg scarf#3571: duality of man
 PlatosMan#2789: Hey all! I just finished rating another batch of games. If you want me to play and review your games, send me a DM with your link
 cathy#3897: yup just go to the bottom of the bar on the left side of submissions and then expand it and there are many options
 Scolon#4218: You can't
 chegusta(nikola)#7094: you rascal
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: any clue if there is a way to view the top rated games?
 Scolon#4218: bruh
 Michel#2879: jk
 birdstone#3073: **bruh**
 cathy#3897: LMFAO im sorry ill be sure to change that right away
 Michel#2879: your drawing is so cool. (speaking about his pfp.) also isn't it inappropriate to have a profile picture of your pussy
 Scolon#4218: If your game makes top 100 or into mark's video you will get a sizeable popularity boost to your game by default
That happens pretty much everytime, especially with the hidden gems
 Digitaldude555#5515: yeah I played that game it was way too easy
 cathy#3897: fair. guess it just depends on what type of gameplay you like
 Scolon#4218: btw guys
 birdstone#3073: Got it!
 Draconium🪁#9786: ok huge wall of text incoming
 89o#5368: Ahh, it feels nice when you play *your own game just for fun* because it's fun...
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: oh I think I played it it is a bit close to other puzzle game but I think it's a unique spin at least i've only seen one with this exact mechanic
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: I have. Didn't think it was fun at all, but people seem to enjoy it
 Michel#2879: lmao can you dm your game tho. I may like to try it
 Scolon#4218: Sure
 Draconium🪁#9786: Can I say my idea to be sure no one else has the same
 paulhdh#6428: not a bad suggestion
 birdstone#3073: who has created what we thought was an abomination in our game but people like it for some reason
 syelan34#3258: so 3 different ones?
 Fox#3756: I tried to steer clear of dice because it seemed like the first thing everyone would think of. So my game has no dice at all.
 MikeHazeJr#6582: You could try running it with Wine
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: review, you risk it being deleted here
 Scolon#4218: Guys keep in mind is really is **6000+ games**
We've each seen/played *less than 0.2% of them*
 birdstone#3073: OH, no i'm a programmer, my teammate also drew my profile picture lol
 syelan34#3258: you are a die, when you move the number on the die changes the same way as if you rolled the die in real life, and you move as far as the die
 sqrt#9237: the one you are talking about
 Beeg scarf#3571: streamer does not equal famous
 paulhdh#6428: Can we post a link to someone elses game in this channel or would it be better to do it in the review channel. I wanted to play it but im linux and it for windows
 NalaFala38290#9305: is it the one where the die has to match the number by rolling around
 Michel#2879: No. I just assumed because of your pfp.
Also your name reminds me of my friend Daniel who's an artist
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: what is the concept?
 Scolon#4218: I made like 20 different rooms but honestly you've probably already seen most of the content
 Spico#6316: 
 syelan34#3258: which?
 Beeg scarf#3571: so far ive seen 1 or 2 games like mine whats yours about
 sqrt#9237: famous people are always like that
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: the problem with that is that implementing a theme to a concept is far more difficult than doing the opposite. You risk making a game that feels out of place
 hzzzln#7656: But I won't be able to rate that one (:
 dhafo#4640: how far do i have to get to experience everything cause sheesh i keep dying in the first couple floors lol
 Toboter#5206: I have never appreciated the Firefox zoom controls more than with these humongous WebGL windows.
 Spico#6316: dont do that
linking a different "fixed" build while the voting period is present may get you disqualified
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: if you are masochist
 snuffysam#2767: so far none of the games i've rated have been the same genre
 sqrt#9237: this streamer fucking sucks bro
 birdstone#3073: I did some of the effects but my other teammate is the artist, did you play ours?
 chegusta(nikola)#7094: hello chums
 syelan34#3258: Actually, I have an updated one that is much better if you’d like
 pibolib#2222: potentially
 Michel#2879:  I assume you are the artist of your team
 Spaceshark YT#4155: 4 ratings 🥳 🥳
 Toboter#5206: No, they are a trap by the burnt-out-developer-industry to get more burnt out developers.
 hzzzln#7656: DM me your game now I'm curious
 Spico#6316: yes and no
 Ber#3410: 19 ratings 🥳🥳
 Lyrcaxis#2555: you can begin setting up a game jam template for the next jam 😛 Some generic extensions/art/tools/mechanics as well
 syelan34#3258: Well I mean every streamer who played it also said they had played the exact same thing 5 or 6 times, and yet I’ve never seen another game like it
 Scolon#4218: Nah it just has some balance issues xD
The recoil is a bit chaotic cause of an oversight
 NalaFala38290#9305: dice flavored
 Starch_Supreme#4835: ah damn, i really wanted some jam on toast. :/
 sqrt#9237: are game jams fun ?
 Toboter#5206: I made a narrative adventure, haven't really seen anyone do that yet (one maybe?).
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: It's the third time I'm writing this, but has anyone seen regular board games? I think in an attempt to be original everyone avoided those
 Lyrcaxis#2555: 🥳 🥳 🥳 🥳 🥳
 dhafo#4640: btw i am so  bad at ur game lol
 birdstone#3073: unfortunately you're a bit late buddy
 Spico#6316: dont let that stop you, if you have a cool idea just make a game out of it
 Starch_Supreme#4835: i heard there was jam here, where do i go?
 Scolon#4218: > "Roll OFF the dice"
Maybe I'm just dirty-minded but that sounds bad out of context
 hzzzln#7656: Well that's what happens when effin **6000** people upload a game
 Draconium🪁#9786: the jam is over
 paulhdh#6428: Hey dumb question can I post about someone elses game jam entrry here? They made a windows game and it looks beautiful but im on linux and i think someone should play it.
 Woahsea#4308: honestly a lot of the 'bad' games still have creative ideas
 Spico#6316: make it! why stop here the worlfs your oyster!
 Beeg scarf#3571: i loved "Pachinko suites"
 dhafo#4640: after this i'm going to be scared of any dice i see IRL, dice overload
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: I saw a couple creative takes on the theme, like someone mentioned "Roll OFF the dice"
 Scolon#4218: lol
 syelan34#3258: See I thought mine was because I didn’t really see anyone doing anything like that but then it seems like it’s actually quite common
 Draconium🪁#9786: I just got a pretty good idea for a game that fits the theme
 LOPSTERu#3902: every game is creative
 hzzzln#7656: Yeah man that game Dice'n'sphere by hzzzln was amazing 🙈
 Spico#6316: not *too* creative but i rated alot of people 5 stars in creativity
 Digitaldude555#5515: anyone see really creative games?
 Beeg scarf#3571: same lol
 Spico#6316: i should maybe change the email adress i use
 Michel#2879: Yeah I am that kind of a serious person
 syelan34#3258: Best Buy is international, although it’s probably some kind of scam
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: I think that's a really big part of it. tbh I keep skipping games without browser builds
 Spico#6316: okay unreleated but why do i have a best buy email in my mailbox
one i didnt know they had a website
two i am not american
and three why the hell would i make a best buy account
 Toliman#7817: Hi if someone want I will try and rate your game (DM me) 🙂
 Beeg scarf#3571: Damn, only half of the games have browser builds
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: yeah man I need some assurance here
 syelan34#3258: Aight bet
 birdstone#3073: i remember last year it was so hard for me to get reviews and i spent a lot of time doing game review swaps
 LAVAL70#6835: Well this is prime blackmail material lmao
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: *raises eyebrow*
 Digitaldude555#5515: it was joke cause that guy said free rating
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: I saw it, interesting idea
 Spico#6316: time to bribe the voting system! rate my game to win one hundred doller!
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: that doesn't work though, they think they are tricking the system but they are just wasting time
 syelan34#3258: O-•
 Scolon#4218: I mean as long as you aren't begging for plays you should be good
People active in chat here seem quite chill
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: 0_o
 Spico#6316: probably
 Digitaldude555#5515: I paid for 20 ratings dont tell mods
 Scolon#4218: Probably to increase their odds or something idk
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: maybe don't listen to the ones that only send messages like "Send me your game if you want a Freeee rating!"
 dhafo#4640: i didnt know what to comment in the review so i just posted the walkthrough
 syelan34#3258: Bruh, what even is the incentive to do that?
 Scolon#4218: rate swap scammers? wtf that's sad
 syelan34#3258: I’m doing the same, it’s like 90% done too
 Digitaldude555#5515: its in teh comment on your game.
 Spico#6316: it did happen to me once where someone asked me to rate swap but then they didnt, just be careful with who you ask it to
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: oh, alright, thanks
 hzzzln#7656: and maaaybe they want you to check theirs out to 😜
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: Which was?
 LAVAL70#6835: That's just sad lmao
 LOPSTERu#3902: idk if its a good idea, but I just sort by random, play the games and try to give good feedback and leave a rating, ive rated 43 games
 Beeg scarf#3571: tbh its kind of a shame theres so many color coded games
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: nah dude I wouldn't worry too much. If people ask you to DM them your game it's because they want to try some games out
 Digitaldude555#5515: try my idea.
 MK#2034: I would only ever rate fairly.
 Spico#6316: i try not even going for 2s i feel bad if i do that
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: Yea, i guess
 Beeg scarf#3571: why 1 star? if i went that way i would rate it all 3 stars to be more fair
 MangoPango#6533: noo like the video the person made got taken down for no reason...it was a game about closing a door lol
 hzzzln#7656: wat. By that logic, shouldn't every rating just be all 1 stars by everybody?
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: if you don't like your own comments, you are commenting wrong
 Draconium🪁#9786: This is really nice of them
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: for trolling
 BlankSlate#8922: I am currently trying to make it so that I rate 2 games for every rate I have
 dhafo#4640: i followed ur itch so u better make one 😎
 Sir Tetris#1382: yeah there are many people who have reviewed 10+ and 20+ games
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: why would they?
 Digitaldude555#5515: does anyone like their own comments they made?
 LAVAL70#6835: Daymn what was ur game about?? Must've been pretty bad lol for it to get taken down
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: Yeah, so many people have left me great ideas
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: tbh i kinda get a bit skeptical when i dm someone my game to rate it because im sort of worried that theyll not play it and just rate it all 1 star :/
 Draconium🪁#9786: yeees great
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: I mean no one else did what you did, sooooo...
 MangoPango#6533: in the first jam I ever participated in..someone made a video and i was super happy but his video got taken down lol
 LAVAL70#6835: Duel of the fates intensifies
 masalt#5723: 2
 dhafo#4640: wait r u actually making a post jam build
 LOPSTERu#3902: read the channel names in the discord
 Draconium🪁#9786: ooooh. ok. By curiosity did people review more games than necessary (not recieving reviews)
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: Idea? I didn't have any ideas
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: 21
 dhafo#4640:  honestly i can't tell if i should rate high or low for creativity, it's certainly a unique idea
Don't know who it is but I'll be forever thankful
 Sir Tetris#1382: wait i thought the question was about the ratings on your submission
ive rated 9 games so far i think?
 Taccos#1054: you speak very professionally while most teens (including myself) are very immature
 Spico#6316: i have 25 i think?
 Beeg scarf#3571: ive rated 20
 LOPSTERu#3902: ive rated 43
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: a proud 26 🙂
 JonasSmrcka#9280: ++, wise words
 masalt#5723: ask people to rate your game
 BlankSlate#8922: How many games have you guys rated I have rated 32 so far
 hzzzln#7656: Send me your games in DM, I'll rate em!
 Draconium🪁#9786: no that's not this kind of game
 Spico#6316: give requests to lesser known streamers! you could get more exposure by giving them to more known ones, but lesser known ones usually play it for alot more
 dhafo#4640: no why would i read things smh
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: Did you not read the huge warning that the rng broke on the Web build?
 Amitgep#9295: im at 4 yeah idk how people get so many
 masalt#5723: x Marks the spot
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: lol
my games a platofrmer that has you roll a dice that sends you to a randomly slected lvl
 Chazi b#4006: 6 🥲
 Beeg scarf#3571: 12
 Draconium🪁#9786: Chad. Reviewing more games than necessary. It's really cool that people devote themselves to the jam like that.
 BlankSlate#8922: 20
 Acu1000#5560: Make an interesting cover image and use the  channel, also theres a plenty of people here who are open to review requests
 Sir Tetris#1382: same, dm me your game ill play it tomorrow 
 LAVAL70#6835: Just 4
 masalt#5723: dm your game and ill play it and rate it and leave feedback
 Sir Tetris#1382: 22
 Draconium🪁#9786: SO many games where you're a dice that rolls around. At least half of my review queue
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: I've got 7 ratings so far
 paulhdh#6428: dm your game and ill play it
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: i'm stuck at nine since a few hours
 dhafo#4640: WAIT ELIZA IT'S THE SAME ROLL EVERY TIME
 masalt#5723: 60k (14)
 Spico#6316: i agree
 Acu1000#5560: 16
 Ting#1574: Me too
 MangoPango#6533: WHAT, im at 3 and i thought like.....omg 3
 Scolon#4218: Well yeah if have a following or you speedrun getting rated early you'll usually get  quite popular
There's so many really good games you can find just browsing random games
 Uthel#6594: 13 😢
 birdstone#3073: currently 64
 Spico#6316: 17
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: haven't checked in a while actually
 paulhdh#6428: im at 21
 dhafo#4640:  i can't even retry 😭
 MangoPango#6533: How many rates do u have guys?
 Spico#6316: i still kinda hate that top rated games get snowballed into 100 or so rating every hour quite fast, since understandably that's what people go to
again alot of hidden gems there are, i can probably link 20 of them
 Casper#6361: Sometimes when one specific part was really bad I still give 1 stars on playable games, but usually not.
 Digitaldude555#5515: yo you werent joking.....
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: Eliza stop please. You at least managed to upload something
 Scolon#4218: 1 star games are usually very obvious
 Michel#2879: xd as in xeinophobic dengus
 dhafo#4640: now i'm curious lolol
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: I only one star unfinished games/ shitposts. If you delivered something playable, no matter how bad, you are getting at least 2 stars
 birdstone#3073: i saw king dice in one game thumbnail, too bad i only noticed it the moment i refreshed my page lol
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: I'll put it in 
 Michel#2879: correct. still most people think I am an adult xd
 masalt#5723: rate my game aamazing immediatlity!
 Digitaldude555#5515: time zone
 Spico#6316: there were 35k ratings when i woke up, and by the middle of the day there were 60k
 Scolon#4218: Ratings are going up fast right now
 BlankSlate#8922: I usually only 1 star if a game is basically unplayable
 Spico#6316: immortal?
 Digitaldude555#5515: link it so I can give 1 star
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: like, queen elizabeth old
 EnergyDashClarko#4158: So just play and rate, that's it, that easy
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: probably my game, it deserves it
 dhafo#4640: i still have to get to it, i've been procrastinating this queue i made, the 1 star is for someone i followed cause i enjoyed a game from another jam  but this time it was just bad and really low effort and apparently a team effort?
 masalt#5723: my 2 days
first day art second day making editor work third day  made actual levels
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: 16-18
 Scolon#4218: Yeah, this is true too
It wouldn't even be a win
 Casper#6361: 15 maybe
 snuffysam#2767: Itch gives a raw score and a weighted score after the results are in.
Itch doesn't make their weighting system public because then it would be easy to cheese. But rest assured that there *is* a weighting system.
 Spico#6316: some people dont think that way though, they just want the attention
 Michel#2879: guys how old do I look
 dhafo#4640: no lmao
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: even if itch didn't, how do you even have fun rating others poorly? Like, is it really a win if you didn't deserve it?
 Spico#6316: i had one game that didnt work
 Digitaldude555#5515: my game? 😭
 birdstone#3073: i'm actually really curious to know how that system works
 dhafo#4640: i did my first 1 star recently 😢 but i try really hard not to usually
 Michel#2879: change one letter and it's a death sentence
 Scolon#4218: itch can detect people trying to cheat the rating system, your ratings will get invalidated if you try to do that so don't waste your time and play fair :]
 Michel#2879: mild. Man I love dices
 Spico#6316: thats definitely what AT LEAST one person thinks in minimum
i keep my points pretty high because i like giving people high points, game devs hard
 Casper#6361: Second day is always rough
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: I feel like some guys just want to win and think that bad ratings will help them achieve that
 EnergyDashClarko#4158: Still hate dice. You?
 masalt#5723: hi jackson
 Michel#2879: whatsupp fat programmers
 Digitaldude555#5515: hmmm
 Spico#6316: surely someone rating everything 1/1/1 but a single game 5/5/5 would jave different influence on the results yeah
 EnergyDashClarko#4158: So, zip and rar files allowed again?
 Scolon#4218: You just need to be above/around the median and a few other factors play into it
For example, not everyone's rating is weighted the same depending on uncertain variables
Your 5 star rating might not have the same effect as someone else's 5 star ratings because they did certain things
 Spico#6316: 5/5/5 on all
if you meant amount i think around 25 by the end is fine if you are struggling to get your game main stream
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: trying to understand your past self, even though it was only the day before.
 Casper#6361: I just had a script called movement at some point which did everything but handle movement
 masalt#5723: whats a good amount of ratings
 Casper#6361: Yeah you eliminate most of the "how did I do this again" time
 dhafo#4640: u just gotta get past an easily achievable threshhold lol not a billion, u dont need a bunch
 ⲟⲩⲥⲓⲣⲉ#2058: What's the game?
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: 26
 dhafo#4640: many of the jam winners last year didnt have the hundreds of ratings that many other games did lol
 Redline#7370: having a small amount of ratings drags your score down, that's how itch works
 Digitaldude555#5515: what wasnt?
 Woahsea#4308: well thats obviously unreasonable haha
 Calavara#6618: that's good to know, thx
 Spico#6316: i just want my game to be seen so it can gather some peoples likings when i update it eventually
 Scolon#4218: I had 224 commits on my game
 dhafo#4640: yes but if u have a small amount of ratings but consistent 5 stars u'll beat them out
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: It's impressive how in 7 hours straight you manage so much more than in 1-2 hours a day
 SpellCast#5277: How many commits
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: and this is why my game is open source, cause then you can see the history and see how long it took
 ⲟⲩⲥⲓⲣⲉ#2058: Happened to us first jam, learned the hard way lol
 Woahsea#4308: honestly with how many games there are i feel that 100 is too small
 SpellCast#5277: True that’s a point
 Calavara#6618: wasn't getting into the top 100 based on how well users liked it?
 Casper#6361: The most challenging part is stepping back every once in a while, asking for feedback and revamping your vision for the game
 Scolon#4218: Yeah you don't, a lot of people just seem to correlate popularity with winning the jam for some reason
 Casper#6361: If you really put your mind to it you can create big features in just an hour or two it's crazy
 dhafo#4640: right i mean i feel great after finishing the game but if u cheat u dont have that lol
 Spico#6316: thats where this jam in particular succeeds at, there are no patterns thats overdone everything is different
 SpellCast#5277: I think for many people it’s for the sense of accomplishment
 dhafo#4640: u dont need TONS of ratings to get to top 100
 Uthel#6594: I was actually shocked how easy it was to make golf logic, I had tons of time leftover for level design and polish 😄
 Scolon#4218: There a LOT of hidden gems
I don't think many of the most popular games are gonna be in the top 100
 dhafo#4640: like there's not even a reward 😭 y u wanna win so bad
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: Something about my game doesn't line up. I have 9 plays but 14 rankings.
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: true, I'm honestly glad I got to play it
 dhafo#4640: honestly cheating on game jams makes 0 sense to me
 Casper#6361: And after all it's not really about the competition.
 Spico#6316: it kinda glares at you when its not done in 48 hours
 Casper#6361: Don't be too suspicious, it's amazing what people can do in 48h
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: It's too well made. I think they just happened to have a game that fit the theme
 dhafo#4640: i really gotta make a game with rpg mechanics, every time i play them in the jam i sit there for awhile
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: tho I don't think this was made during the jam tbh
 Spico#6316: i think its called karma tho
coolness = karma unless im getting something mixed
 BlankSlate#8922: Can you send me the game?
 BurgerWizard#8683: Mostly yeah, but I got pro for free soooo
 CryoTyro#4910: it doesn't seem to line up with the karma rankings on the page tho
but I had the same thought
 Ian Mykl#4218: I think it's how many ratings the person who made the game has given
 CryoTyro#4910: does anyone know how itch's 'coolness' score works?
 Spico#6316: alot actually
 Shimp#0064: Send me in dms please
 akaBl4ck#7384: yeah me too
 [Error_27]#3011: pip factory is really good and really addictive
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: there is an rpg I spent 1 hour playing
 Ian Mykl#4218: I wonder if this person whose name says "dm to trade rates" and keeps asking in chat to trade ratings want to trade raitings with anyone
 Fox#3756: There were a few really good ones. My favourites were probably "Dice of Los Sueños" and "Dice Knight 2600".
 Omegnight#7081: So, any favorites hidden gems so far?
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: i did
 akaBl4ck#7384: Send me dm if you wanna trade ratings
 SpellCast#5277: My favorite is prob fire and dice
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: sure
 BlankSlate#8922: Mine is probably Dice Catcher
 Casper#6361: Mac is a pain to support
 PokeNinjaGuy#9592: I have 28 😎
 PlatosMan#2789: Super Dice Boy
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: i have around 24 ratings
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: wait more people supported Linux then MacOS?
 cathy#3897: i think ours is at 50 ish
 LOPSTERu#3902: i got *says smaller amount*
 Scolon#4218: I'm at 25
 krisis in a jar#0904: 22-24
 Redline#7370: I got 30 😎 ^^ yes 
 akaBl4ck#7384: Anyone want to trade ratings
 SpellCast#5277: I got 13
 Ian Mykl#4218: Me when 19
 PlatosMan#2789: Hey all! I just finished rating another batch of games. If you want me to play and review your games, send me a DM with your link
 dhafo#4640:  y u always make good strat game for gmtk, u too OP
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: guys what your favorite game that you rated so far in this jam? For me is a game called "This Is Definitely How Dice Work"
 NalaFala38290#9305: I got 14
 BlankSlate#8922: I got 20
 krisis in a jar#0904: Btw only send me games if they have a Linux build (and weren't made on Unity) or are available to play on the browser
 grong dong bongle#6426: gonna be one hell of an update then, maybe i can get webassembly working
 272354#2943: it's one week long i believe
 grong dong bongle#6426: when's the voting period going to end? i want to update my game
 akaBl4ck#7384: I got 17
 Scolon#4218: If you have anywhere above 20 ratings (currently) then you're fine in terms of placing well
 Acu1000#5560: the median is 7 currently
 Casper#6361: Yeah previous years it didn't go far above 20 (if it all)
 Scolon#4218: Karma will only impact your game visibility as long as your game is in need of ratings though
If you're far above the median it doesn't do anything
 Toboter#5206: Gotcha 👍
 Digitaldude555#5515: is 21 ratings enough for the median?
 snuffysam#2767: it's not what GMTK intended, but it is how itch's system works
 Hobusu#5033: There isn't actually a hard rule against huge walls of text like this, but I'd recommend using a website like pastebin in the future since we'd greatly prefer you not post something that large in  and doing it too often could qualify as spam
 Casper#6361: Yes, otherwise you could mass add contributors to skew voting
 Scolon#4218: Yes
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: reddit moment
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: I think that's a number that goes up the more you rate other people's games and it makes yours more likely to be seen.
 272354#2943: I'm a contributor on my game but still have to use the rating queue. Is this intentional?
 Casper#6361: I also made my project quite early on to upload playtest builds
 Art#9335: What's the "karma"?
 OrangoMango#0973: Also if I keep old version?
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: After rating is done you can just upload the whole thing.
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: If youre a youtuber as popular as Dani, yes lol
 Acu1000#5560: some madlad uploaded 11 minutes after start
 Chazi b#4006: Not during rating, after rating is done you can
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: Not during the voting period
 dhafo#4640: it should be mandatory for my game to have 60k ratings 😎
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: Nope. Rules state that you can't add a link to a non-jam version of the game.
 OrangoMango#0973: Am I allowed to keep the build files for my game and add a link for a fixed version of it?
 Scolon#4218: Last two jams we hit 140k ratings so we still got a ways to go
But ratings are increasing steadilly I think we'll make it
 dhafo#4640: i mean u prob are if u doing that haha, but u can also mix it with stuff like github etc
 Casper#6361: +1
 akaBl4ck#7384: You should just use GitHub ngl
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: oh wait we hit 60K ratings 🙂
 Scolon#4218: Unless you're making small af games
 Casper#6361: 1 gb of cloud is not much for gamedevelopment
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: i mean... 1 GB seems kinda smal tbh
 dhafo#4640: which should be enough tbh lol
 BurgerWizard#8683: Ok I checked, the free version is a maximum team of 4 and 1gb of cloud
 akaBl4ck#7384: I do that always
Using extract here just extracts the zip while using extract to makes a folder for it however most people use extract here so it's best to put a folder inside the zip
 dhafo#4640: i literally always forget the itch app is a thing lol
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: alright
How many people have already done it?
 krisis in a jar#0904: Yessir
 Casper#6361: Or when people don't mark their builds as windows so it doesn't work in the itch app
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: im pretty sure you have to upload a zip folder for your game
 akaBl4ck#7384: Gosh darn it
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: In retrospect I should have done this.
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: ohhhh alright thx
 dhafo#4640: underrated but i love when people zip a folder instead of the insides of a folder 10/10 to people that do that
 Casper#6361: Not as many huge numbers as I expected
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: so you want me to dm my game to you?
 Toboter#5206: People who've been added to the game in the itch settings as "contributors", and the original dev.
 dhafo#4640: u can give credit to accounts that didnt upload the game themselves
 BurgerWizard#8683: Hmm, I'll go check how it works
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: wait what are contributers, people who support your pproject?
 dhafo#4640: u guys made too many dang games smh too many to play
 Casper#6361: You can use Unity teams but with some limitations
 dhafo#4640: i made a team with 2 people in 2019, logged in and it still says the other person is in the "organization" but idk havent tried it recently
 krisis in a jar#0904: Yes, NOW!!!!!!!!!
 Scolon#4218: 
 akaBl4ck#7384: Everyone let's rate the top 10 least rated
 Omegnight#7081: Just added a short description "I am speed", hope this helps getting some attention lol
 Valkyrrii#3264: a streamer disliking a game can also slaughter the ratings haha
 SaadTheGlad#9716: did you just say...*NOW*?!
 Scolon#4218: Man if I had a penny for everytime the word dice appeared in this game jam...
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: I'm reluctant to send my game to streamers. Like, yes, I want my game to have visibility. But also it's a puzzle game and playing it means that people watching will have the solutions spoiled and no reason to play it themselves.
 Toboter#5206: Good idea.
 Toboter#5206: Don't see one.
 Redline#7370: hmm yes, a .txt file could be a bit better next time so it won't fill up the chat
 BurgerWizard#8683: I thought you needed unity pro to use unity teams
 Scolon#4218: Be careful there might be a rule against massive messages
 dhafo#4640: deserved they need to be better than the rest
 Vincent#7401: Anyone know if Mark is gonna do streams playing random games this year?

 SpellCast#5277: Same

 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: in this server, capslock is not a thing
so peopl out there, use shift
 krisis in a jar#0904: Sorry, i want to rate literally every game
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: chill on the caplock lol, I know you're excited
 Saxophone Siphonophore#1485: If a game gets deleted and no one's around to see it, did it ever exist?
 Acu1000#5560: Pretty sure unity is free for anyone unless you earn $100k/year
 jonahhw#9743: Laughs in *doesn't like Unity anyway*
 krisis in a jar#0904: IT'S A ORDER, I'M NOT ASKING

 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: Imagine how much mods are scared when the press it for others games

 krisis in a jar#0904: I really want to press it for no reason at all
 Acu1000#5560: on my way
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: Same
 DangerNoodle#5924: Hello! I'm trying your games giving honest and not biased (as much as I can) feedback. You can send them to me in DM! :D
 Ting#1574: I always afraid that I will accidentally click it.
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: XDD
 Acu1000#5560: same lmao
 masalt#5723: yes
 dhafo#4640: more related to "on a cube, how can i found out how many possible paths there are to form a closed loop" quora

 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: please make a channel with 2+ minutes slowmode called after-jam-chat for us

 masalt#5723: wowiee!!!!! aug
 akaBl4ck#7384: When is brackeys wowie and ludum dare
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: pay up plebs
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Alas, you are all correct in assuming that the GMTK discord is an oligarchy
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yeah you'll still be part of the server there' just no channels you can join
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: and Chief's
 TwoWholeWorms#8078: What is 'joke'? 😶
 masalt#5723: no way
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: at least we still have Brackeys' server
 Taccos#1054: it was a joke
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: other servers exist but whatever you choose
 Scolon#4218: Yeah we can just stare at the eternal abyss when the server closes
 AromaticA#3738: the interaction is a privilege for the wealthy
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: not until next year
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: Darn 😦
 Taccos#1054: no social interaction, just like in the real world!
 masalt#5723: people who go "thats like"
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: I have the same question lol
 snuffysam#2767: That’s how many likes the comment has
 macleodian#7269: that's the number of likes it has
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: A few days after Mark's video goes up the public channels close so any non=patrons won't be kicked out but you won't be able to interact anywhere
 akaBl4ck#7384: After marks video it will be Patreon only again
 Indigu#6862: What is this (+1) that's next to every comment on some games?
 masalt#5723: flappy bird    but hit everything or lose
 Saxophone Siphonophore#1485: Is it "being creative"?
 Taccos#1054: so after the week this server will be a warzone?
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: welp I think I will work in a big project
the thing is I only have 1 idea
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: whats going to happen with this server after the voting period?
 Saxophone Siphonophore#1485: btw, how long will this server be up for?
 masalt#5723: nice!
 macleodian#7269: Oh now that'd be fun!
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: We want this to be a nice chill server for the remaining week or so, minimal tolerance for shithousery
 Saxophone Siphonophore#1485: Platformer, but instead of you jumping it's all the obstacles.
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: nooooooooooooooo
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: Thanks, Mr. Architect.
 macleodian#7269: 🤢
that'd be fun but so unsettling lol
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: Game that's pixel art but all the pixels are rotated 45 degrees.
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Just going to throw it in here that whilst the vast majority of you all have been lovely, please don't hesitate to ping me or one of the other mods if someone is being a jerk
 Redline#7370: so true
 macleodian#7269: Now that I think about it a theme of Jame Gam for the 2023 one would be cool (basically nothing's right, or stuff is just a little off sorta theme)
 Taccos#1054: rayman harder than dark souls
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: Lol
 Aeph#4622: same here! mine needs a few bug fixes and additional features but should be done in a few updates
 akaBl4ck#7384: Make it rainbow 🌈
 Uthel#6594: Jame Gam 2023
 dhafo#4640: an algo just generates a color palette for u and it looks amazing
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: it's a great tool
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: yea  just use the roles in this erver as the colors 🙂
 JuliusCube#8501: are you gonna make the g and the j thats part of the g different colors?
 dhafo#4640: u know off topic but talking to fellow jammers it's surprising how many people dont know about coolors co lol
 Taccos#1054: if rayman (1995) didnt need playtesting, neither does my game
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: Oh, i playtested my game for a bit to see if the randomly selected levels were working as i wanted to
 snuffysam#2767: Depends how precise you define “color”. Just loop around the color wheel with the golden ratio as an angle and you’ll never hit the same hue twice
 Taccos#1054: you have a color in your name, you can figure something out
 DangerNoodle#5924: Hello! I'm trying your games giving honest and not biased (as much as I can) feedback. You can send them to me in DM! :D
 akaBl4ck#7384: Make the G green
 Scolon#4218: Me when they tell me to imagine a new color
 Saxophone Siphonophore#1485: Transparent.  ame Maker' Toolkit  ame Jam
 Beeg scarf#3571: from .7 to 6 k submissions
 BlankSlate#8922: Gonna invent new colours
 Mark Brown#6982: buddy, you don't wanna know
 Ty4ft31#0767: u submit game but it's not playable
 Scolon#4218: I like how the G keeps changing color
I wonder what color it will be next year.
 JuliusCube#8501: 2017
 dhafo#4640: what are u going to do once u run out of colors for the G
 akaBl4ck#7384: What year did the GMTK jam start?
 masalt#5723: a lot of the people commenting on my submission said it would make a great full game so likely me
 krisis in a jar#0904: I'm on Linux which Mac's kernel is based of, send me yo game
 PlatosMan#2789: Hey all! I just finished rating another batch of games. If you want me to play and review your games, send me a DM with your link
 FireSquid#8882: it doesn't show the number joined anymore, but the number submitted is on the website. I recall the number joined being around 22k
 dardasaba#9759: Nice
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: Y'all are getting nowhere, arguing in bad faith and with anecdotal evidence. Maybe just drop it?
 vladdeSV#6969: thanks!
 Scolon#4218: Every game has atleast 1 rating now btw
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: what do you mean?
 Shimp#0064: If i feel like continuing the idea into a full game, i might make it a bit of both based on player's performance
 Spaceshark YT#4155: is there anyone here on a mac who is willing to rate my game since the player movement in my windows build is broken?
 Redline#7370: sure thanks for your help
 dhafo#4640: most engaged with comment of all time
 PlatosMan#2789: Hey all! I just finished rating another batch of games. If you want me to play and review your games, send me a DM with your link.
 BurgerWizard#8683: Some people don't plan ahead of time, and then can't join on that day for one reason or another
 Omniclause#4760: This feels like a weird thing to get into semi argument over. If you wanna believe the majority of jam participants submit games that’s fine and not hurting anyone
 vladdeSV#6969: how do you know that?? where does this information come from? statistict? your opinion?
 Ty4ft31#0767: who's finishing games after submiting?
 dardasaba#9759: But again, why are we arguing?? :P
 FireSquid#8882: I mean last year I joined the GMTK game jam 2021 but then got covid and decided not to participate
 Aeph#4622: i felt that too! but i stuck with my gut and made a wave-based shooter-like game
 Amitgep#9295: how many people do you guys think didn't finish on time?
like from the 22k that signed up
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: If Ben messages you again and you don't like it then let us know but don't reply or continue the conversation
 dardasaba#9759: You can't see how many people were In a team, but I'm sure that not all of the 75% who joined the jam and didn't submit were in a team
 Manuel4o5#1038: Or they worked in teams
 Taccos#1054: a lot are also late
 krisis in a jar#0904: Or don't finish in the deadline
 vladdeSV#6969: 4
 FireSquid#8882: 22k people joined the GMTK game jam and only 6k submitted. Lots of people just click "oh Ill join this" but don't submit
 PlatosMan#2789: Hey all! I just finished rating another batch of games. If you want me to play and review your games, send me a DM with your link. Or DM me and I can send you mine! 😄
 Saxophone Siphonophore#1485: Welcome to Ludo Designer Toolbox
 dhafo#4640: how many jams have u done cause from my experience this is like never true lol
 krisis in a jar#0904: Mark's secret account is poopyfarts
 vladdeSV#6969: where do i see how many people decided to join and not submit a game, and that they weren't in a team?
 masalt#5723: ive submitted around 9% i think
 macleodian#7269: real, I *really* like unity's workflow rn (partly because I'm finally getting the hang of it finally) and the C# language, but I think I'll switch to Godot or Unreal until/if they get their crap together
 Taccos#1054: my name is Bark Mrown
 krisis in a jar#0904: Omgmgmgmgmg
 Redline#7370: *he didn't do the /j thing guys*
 Shimp#0064: Uh, mods, i feel like war is about to erupt
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: that I don't agree with
 Saxophone Siphonophore#1485: You see, that's my secret: I'm actually Mark' alt.
 Omniclause#4760: You can see joined versus submissions on past jams. This jam for example had around 1/4 of the participants submit a game. He is definitely right about this
 akaBl4ck#7384: Omg guys every unity game bad!!!! ***/j***
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: I should hope not, that'd be a conflict of interest.
 BlankSlate#8922: I am trying to switch from Unity to GameMaker rn
 vladdeSV#6969: sorry bout that :)
 krisis in a jar#0904: It's rather wonky lol. Breaks often, awful perfomance, etc
 Taccos#1054: not really.
some games are more suited to a specific engine.
for example, you can get much better graphics with unreal but it would be overkill to make a retro shooter in unreal
 dardasaba#9759: Nope
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: that can be true in some cases
 FireSquid#8882: Wait does mark submit to the GMTK game jam?
 dhafo#4640: even the unity devs hate unity rn 😭
 Amitgep#9295: OFC True rating
 akaBl4ck#7384: Omg guys unity suck!!!
 vladdeSV#6969: > how do you know most people dont? you just say people don't, with nothing backing that claim
 BurgerWizard#8683: XD
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: Because Unity got the marketing and publicity and tutorials to become the go-to for introductory game development. Alternatives exist, but GameMaker is more expensive, Construct is less capable, Godot doesn't have the marketing, etc.
 dardasaba#9759: With nothing backing that claim except the experience of pretty much everyone :P
But why are we arguing on this? xD that's a silly thing to argue about :D
 Amitgep#9295: Is like asking people to rate your game so you could rate their game back ok?
 dhafo#4640: what u mean 😭 everyone is hating unity rn
 Taccos#1054: you got the wrong reply XD
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: assembly best "engine"
 Shimp#0064: I've seen a lot of Godot on the jam
 Manuel4o5#1038: It depends more on the developer tbh
 hzzzln#7656: So anyone need some ratings? Send me your game in dm
 krisis in a jar#0904: Unity's overrated imo
 Taccos#1054: depends on the game
 uturn#2245: As someone who did that, _how dare you_
But actually I haven't seen a lot of that.  This is going to sound mean, and I don't mean it that way, but I have seen a lot of "I made this genre worse by randomizing core aspects of it."  Which... I get, my team didn't have a vertical slice until 30 hours in, that's a long way in to reverse course if you realized that's what you did.
 krisis in a jar#0904: ENGINE WARS!!
 vladdeSV#6969: how do you know most people dont? you just say people don't, with nothing backing that claim
 BurgerWizard#8683: _(best engine)_
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: You've been warned already, stop causing trouble
 Shimp#0064: Its funny how i made a platformer for the jam and i encountered the same problem that Mark did. Aka "this game feels like it has to be a puzzle game"
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: cause it's easy
 dhafo#4640: honestly i hated and still hate the theme but i just went with it and a decent game came out of it
 Taccos#1054: its free and capable
 dardasaba#9759: I have submitted 100% of jams I joined too, but doesn't change the fact most people don't
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: why is so many game made on unity?
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: I've only submitted 80% of the time tbh. I think ymmv.
 BurgerWizard#8683: Heyoooo
 masalt#5723: burgar wizd!!!
 dardasaba#9759: All you gotta do is scroll up to the jam times and see just how many people said "alright I'm giving up, can't think of an idea" or something
 OrangoMango#0973: My game has memory leaks :(
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: I've rated 26 games, time to rest
 BurgerWizard#8683: Thanks for being a great teacher for all of us here :D
 Taccos#1054: is there anyone here from botswana?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: right, ok, so the pattern i'm seeing the most is "after you get comfortable within the engine you have to experiment and try out making ideas you have"
 vladdeSV#6969: i've submitted a game 100% of the times i've participated, and so my friends. please tell me where this well known fact comes from
 masalt#5723: games where you have to move dice around (including mine)
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: I played one with that title that was extremely fun
 Fusoy#6101: I saw something like that on twitter, yeah
 Spico#6316: honestly i havent notice a pattern, all the games i played were releatively unique in their own right
 dardasaba#9759: Again, nothing proven, it's all from experience
It's a known fact that most people who join a jam don't submit
 AKUTO#8881: yo
 hzzzln#7656: In the start I was thinking about a game like "Roll OFF the dice", did anybody do/encounter anything like that?
 Manuel4o5#1038: When I felt like my skills got stuck I sat down and tried to make a 3D game for the first time (I only worked on 2D before) and because I was drunk or something I decided to make a multiplayer team FPS. I pulled through eventually and since then I felt like I improved a lot. In fact I still play it with my friends from time to time.
Probably not the best advice but that's my experience.
 calamitty2#4599: i feel like every year there is a "Most Common" theme of game within the theme given
this year i have seen mostly where your character is a dice and the side that is up matters as your move around a grid.
what have you seen?
 MrBen#0001: . you just started this
 SaadTheGlad#9716: Our *main mechanic* of the game wasn't working until about 4 hours before the jam
 vladdeSV#6969: im curious, where did you get that number?
 Spico#6316: slice & dice
 Digitaldude555#5515: mods im being roasted 😔
 dhafo#4640: honestly submitting it gave me so much trouble this year lol
 masalt#5723: next year is roll of the slice
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: Ben, STOP
 dardasaba#9759: I don't have actual numbers because I can't know which people were in a team, but usually in game jams only ~20% of the people actually have a game at the end
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: ok honestly i kind of hate to see the conversation being taken by two people fighting over the quality of someones game can mods do something
 Redline#7370:  this man is harassing me and publicly pasting my comment on his game, and also roasting my game
 SaadTheGlad#9716: Exactly, and the funny thing is, so much of the work happens in the last 8 hours
 uturn#2245: Thanks!  Honestly, doing this at all in 48 hours is incredible.
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: It's easy to think it's nothing special because you did this and this wrong, but just submitting something is an achievement
 MrBen#0001: lol u got quiet
 Digitaldude555#5515: link it
 Alex Silva#8787: that's good, i think
 LOPSTERu#3902: i mean yeah thats the theme
 Spico#6316: tutorials can only get you so far, honestly just quit everything and jump into a product you want to do. Dont be ashamed if its not finished, its the attempt that counts. I have been game deving for a year and Cue Roll is my only release yet, next to around 10 cancelled projects
 dhafo#4640: i think i just showed u my before and after pictures  idk if u actually looked it up urself but i never linked it lol
 Uthel#6594: I hope mine gets high enough for you to try it - I don't really do social media or have a following, so will have to rely on the integrity of the itch rating/voting/suggestion system 😨
 Omegnight#7081: Just played around 15 games and I must say one thing : ||DICE. EVERYWHERE.||
 vladdeSV#6969: most people don't submit? any statistic for that?
 MrBen#0001: its actually cool
 Digitaldude555#5515: didnt I rate your game?
 dhafo#4640: ro-ll lol
 dardasaba#9759: Teams are a part of the reason, but most people that join still don't submit, so yeah whoever submitted something should be pretty proud :)
Also hello again
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: what's the name of the game?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: hey does anyone have any advice for improving from the beginner to intermediate gap of gamedev? i feel like i'm stuck and i'm not sure that beating my head repeatedly against tutorials for specific things is going to exactly help
 dhafo#4640: i cannot take criticism, no one is literally giving me any 😭 please insult me
 DangerNoodle#5924: send it to me pal!
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: we are here to have a good time. Stop insulting each other
 masalt#5723: someone criticize my game nobody has yet im scared that i made something genuinely good
 Spico#6316: i think its a game thats about tardigrates, it has around 13+ team members but idr the name of it
 LOPSTERu#3902: yooooo
 MrBen#0001: lmao compare my game to ur game which is literaly about clicking circles (amazing idea)
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: stop arguing people
 uturn#2245: Probably not the largest, but we had 9 people.  None of us had come together on something like this before.  It went surprisingly well.
 Redline#7370: oh you can't take opinions and the fact that you don't mention a menu like at all?
 Spico#6316: it highly depends on how skilled they are and how they are able to coordinate
 MrBen#0001: yeah it's cool. I love graphics ngl
 Digitaldude555#5515: ah okay, so its not an achievement 😔
 Twelveoclock#2212: i dont find that a team of people will do always better
 dhafo#4640: i think u just rated my game and didnt even bad mouth me smh
 Fusoy#6101: What's the biggest team this year ?
 MrBen#0001: ?
 vladdeSV#6969: teams of people
 akaBl4ck#7384: S
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: don't forget that teams enter so it's not a 1/1 ratio
 dhafo#4640:  it was u
 MrBen#0001: I will roast u one by one:
`theme:` By rolling a dice you are able to do an unexpected  changes to the level and character movement (moving platforms, stopping time, Changing gravity, Changing player speed... I tried making it more random but I ran out of time.
`player:` lmao ur game has a *high quality one*
`no main menu:` there's menu and pause menu.
 calamitty2#4599: true
 Digitaldude555#5515: 21k signed up only 6k submitted
 masalt#5723: impossible 💀
 Uthel#6594: Same. I thought I'd be pressed for time, but I even managed to do extensive testing and slap a couple layers of polish on it 😄
 Redline#7370: I read your page, there's no extra information, it's basically the same thing as your submission comment
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: my CTR is decreasing...
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: So mark is just stealing idea before he make his own game?
 dardasaba#9759: Godot wild jam is good, but it's, well, Godot, and Marc uses unity
 Mark Brown#6982: yeah, maybe!
 tinderet#7708: Submitting a playable game is a huge achievement honestly
 Mark Brown#6982: i couldn't make the game until i learned how, gmtk is me learning - teaching others is just a nice byproduct
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: yo same dude. Honestly, I thought I'd need a week. I somehow managed to submit a playable game!
 Spico#6316: the updates are just in, on the analytics, i got 300 more views and the CTR is increased to 1.20% ish, that gif definitely did something right
 unityAccount#7810: Hey Mark, how about a general gaming livestream? It's been a while since you've done one of those. (Of course, after all the jam stuff are done)
 BurgerWizard#8683: Mark, I had a question, how come you started teaching how to make games before you started making a game?
 Mark Brown#6982: i've already failed in public with developing, who cares anymore!
 syelan34#3258: i'm definitely going to extend mine as well as add some fixes but a level editor would be _way_ too hard for me
 BlankSlate#8922: One of the first things I am gonna do to my game is try and completely remake it in game maker studio
 Uthel#6594: I had a blast, my first game jam, will defo take place again next year 😄
 calamitty2#4599: Godot wild jam has had some good themes and going strong.
 MrBen#0001: #readmygamepage 👈   you only got the negatives xD
 Redline#7370: wow you copy pasted my comment, I call harassment on that I'm now offended
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: You will tell me the theme for 2025's game jam RIGHT NOW.
 FryDev#0372: Ludum Dare divided into a 72 hour version and 48 hour version
 Nectar#2888: Will you use an alias so people don’t know it’s you or do you just go for it
 DangerNoodle#5924: I really loved the style, you were right. Really reminded me of Limbo.
The movement felt a bit unnatural at times, and I would have preferred a more randomized approach.
So yeah, a bit linear in my opinion, but puts the base for a more refined product! Try to spend some more time on it after the jame ends! :D
 Mark Brown#6982: Wowie is a possibility
 BurgerWizard#8683: Join the wowieeee
 Redline#7370: make it so that it has to do with sans undertale somehow
 MrBen#0001: `The game basically doesn't have anything to do with rolling the dice, you just get to the dice. And go to another level. And no the "unexpected changes" when you press R are all scripted, and not randomised, which would be worse, but this way it has NOTHING to do with dice. Also the white rectangle for the player is just low effort compared to the rest of the design (why no background?). No main menu or any options to be seen, and the game is pretty short and buggy.`
 nakst#1416: Is there any chance the game jam time length will change (72 hours?) in the coming years? I think Ludum Dare made the switch
 masalt#5723: wowie
 Mark Brown#6982: Yep, definitely planning to do someone else's jam
 akaBl4ck#7384: I wanna extend my game a bit and add a level editor
 syelan34#3258: true my highest res sprite is 64 x 64
 Manuel4o5#1038: Yeah true, perhaps another popular jam, I mean if you want to get more into game development there is no better way to do it.
 Mark Brown#6982: I should clarify, I *will* know the theme. 2023's has not been decided yet, naturally 😛
 dhafo#4640: 6000 different dice puns
 Redline#7370: stop, and read my comment
 MrBen#0001: but my game is *high quality*
 Tapu#9161: I believe the guy/gal who's first on karma sort
 Nectar#2888: Interesting… needs a twist to it tho to make it more unique
 calamitty2#4599: who has rated the most games so far?
 ⲟⲩⲥⲓⲣⲉ#2058: They'll just have to double down on the work, we deserve fun more frequently!
 unityAccount#7810: Same, I didn't make it in time but will surely finish the project
 Redline#7370: Finally rated 21 games I think that's enough for today (I chose mostly random ones, and tried a couple of the most rated)
 Mark Brown#6982: 1) I know the theme
2) I have to run the jam!
3) The jam is about the community, my involvement would distract from that
 Danny Dan Dan#6699: Alrighty, it's time for me to refactor all my code and try making version 2 of my game 😎
 BlankSlate#8922: Plague doctor
 Manuel4o5#1038:  why don't you participate in the next year's jam?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: bad. got stuck watching task master season 8. haven't been rating games for hours now
 ⲟⲩⲥⲓⲣⲉ#2058: With the size increase, it would be nice to get two of these a year. Can't wait a whole year for these to happen again
 Omegnight#7081: Just reported it since I now heard the song
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: oh no another mark meme/mark genre game
 masalt#5723: last four digits of your social security number theme
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: pretty people still made some of those
 syelan34#3258: And yet there have been SO MANY shooter games
 paulhdh#6428: going very well
 Mark Brown#6982: thanks, i'll look into it
 Scolon#4218: Yo yo yo how is the playing and rating going guys
 Tapu#9161: Oh god
 Casper#6361: I feel like this theme was specifically to combat and conspire against shoot to move games
 Omegnight#7081: No, it's Mark made of dice and a very sketchy song
 syelan34#3258: That’s exactly why it’s web, also, my game is under 150kb with dozens of PNGs for sprites
 LOPSTERu#3902: that is gonna be next years theme
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: stop saying that i keep hearing it in the mark-video tone
 masalt#5723: bark mrown the chat !
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: yes I only had 1 with 3/4 days and I didn't really work for it
 Nectar#2888: Congratulations, epic victory royale 🤝
 Manuel4o5#1038: Good for you I spent about 30-35 hours on the computer. I barely slept, had a blue screen of death (thankfully the project didn't got corrupted), and
today I had to attend my big brother's wedding ceremony. Tldr I'm dead 💀
 Omegnight#7081: Honestly "Oogy Boogy Woogy, Let's Do A Banana Slamma" was a better phrase
 Mark Brown#6982: me!!! yessss i won this year
 Chazi b#4006: This was a good theme, I can tell because I hated it for 6 hours and then loved it for 42 🙂
 akaBl4ck#7384: I was gonna make my last level in my game dicing onions
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: brainstorming's an awesome system
 Valkyrrii#3264: Oh that’s a wonderful system.
 FryDev#0372: my idea was going to be a western themed game where you shoot dice to pair them up into snake eyes, too bad I couldn’t finish it
 Tapu#9161: Is the dice faces Mark's face?
 Nectar#2888: Which of you said it tho that’s what’s important
 Fredison#9375: That would have been hilarious
 birdstone#3073: great system
 Mark Brown#6982: my wife and i said random phrases at each other until we said a good one
 Uthel#6594: I had an idea too late to have a game about dicing vegetables in a rolling vehicle - just dicing and rolling, no rolling dice.
 Viciouz6#4491: To be honest, you gave me like the greatest idea for a game i will most likely develop into a full game
 Omegnight#7081: There's a game called _"Mark Brown used to roll the dice"_, if I remember correctly it's against the rules?
 MrBen#0001: e
 calamitty2#4599: honestly i expected the theme to be Magnets 🧲
 Nectar#2888:  how did you come up with this theme?
 LOPSTERu#3902: (but honestly the theme last year was way better maybe i think)
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: don't forget game where the character is just a dice but no random element
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: this theme tore apart my family and gave me rabies. 10/10
 birdstone#3073: iii'm mr king dice
 Woum#5790: Shame on you, I liked your prank!
 Casper#6361: Often it is an entire weekend! They don't happen very often and I didn't have many options for transportation until recently I think it would undoubtedly be a worthwhile experience though
 Valkyrrii#3264: The one I saw everyone brought sleeping bags. Your team members would take shifts.
 Fredison#9375: I don't know, if my dice rolled 7s I would consider them particularly good
 Nectar#2888: I’d love to get some ideas for new characters/dates to add to my game in the future. Maybe some peoples OCs or something
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i'm already basically imagining mark's video being divided in 3 parts where he talks about games where the dice rolling was literal and central to the gameplay, the dice rolling was literal but just aided the gameplay and wasn't random per se, and the dice rolling was interpreted more as generally "rng". DO NOT POST THAT DICE FUCK, MARK I HATE HIM WITH MY LIFE
 masalt#5723: i submited my game way early and the levels are rushed because i had to go to the beach but forgot sunscreen now im sunburned not worth it dice game
 Tapu#9161: Bruh
 dhafo#4640: random gun spawns
 CryoTyro#4910: randomized elements or something?
 akaBl4ck#7384: Too bland
 calamitty2#4599: haha same, we made marble physics rolling dice.
 Casper#6361: I had a number on screen to indicate the randomness at some point but I scrapped it cause it just caused confusion and my horrible code kept rolling 7s for my 6 sided dice
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: wait, that is a thing? what do you do like 10 hours straight and everyone goes home?
 Toboter#5206: Honestly, "Money" would be a pretty cool theme.
 Fusoy#6101: There's more dice in this game jam than all of video game history
 Reinspieler#2067: Hey it was my first GamJam ever and i sleeped combinend 14 hours not bad. But my pc time..... 29 hours in the 48 hour window : )
 dhafo#4640: i played a game that was straight up just an arena shooter earlier, no dice
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: now itch.io contain a lot more dice game
 BlankSlate#8922: I actually took some inspiration for my game from Monopoly
 masalt#5723: jokes on you, i  made a!
 Manuel4o5#1038: Honestly the last year's theme was way better. Such a shame I couldn't participate at that time.
 akaBl4ck#7384: I took the idea very literally, you're a dice that rolls when it moves
 MrBen#0001: monopoly
 hzzzln#7656: Jokes on you, I just slapped some dice on what I wanted to do anyway
 calamitty2#4599: haha the theme felt restrictive at first but i think it was still good and open in the end.
 Fredison#9375: To the point where after Day 1 we saw all those projects-in-progress with literal dice in them and wondered if we had done something wrong by making the dice-rolling less literal
 Toboter#5206: He just tRolling.
 CryoTyro#4910: my health has declined from sleep deprivation
you'll be hearing from my lawyers /j
lol
 FryDev#0372: next year will be about checkers
 calamitty2#4599: i only mention my rating if its 15/15 when commenting personally.
 Valkyrrii#3264: You _sure did_ and there’s some bangers in there.
 Fredison#9375: Joke's on you, our game has no dice in it at all!
 akaBl4ck#7384: I cut my scope in like 15 pieces lol
 MrBen#0001: it turns out that the gamejam was a social experiment
 Relis#1309: lol
 birdstone#3073: whatever happened to the "pants are for losers" theme
 Manuel4o5#1038: Bro i overscoped so hard on my game
 Mark Brown#6982: cant believe i made 6000 people mak a game about dice lol wat an epic prank
 CryoTyro#4910: everyone is so nice in the comments, its hard to tell if they rated you highly lol
 MrBen#0001: 🤩
 masalt#5723: if anybody wants to try mine dm ill send the submission link
 Manuel4o5#1038: I was on a big break after the last one I entered. I took a year off itch to persue freelancing on fiverr.
 akaBl4ck#7384: Same, the other jams that I did were 30 days, 7 days and I think 7 days
 DangerNoodle#5924: I'm downloading yours rn!
 Casper#6361: I'd still like to do an in person jam at some point they seem really cool
 Valkyrrii#3264: Second official one for me, prolly 5th or 4th counting in person events and ones I did but didn’t officially join.
 Digitaldude555#5515: 20 ratings...why is everyone saying interesting idea in comments im scared bros.
 MrBen#0001: ?
 Manuel4o5#1038: Same for me, but it's the first with 48hrs deadline
 Chazi b#4006: Same here
 Casper#6361: Karma isn't as important as it used to be because they changed some things
 masalt#5723: this the first jam ive actually submitted a game to after joining
 Redline#7370: yeah so original whoops wrong reply 
 ⲟⲩⲥⲓⲣⲉ#2058: Wouldn't matter since it'll be shown in the popular section and karma is just used as another sorting method
 akaBl4ck#7384: This is like my 3rd jam excluding private jams
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: yeah that's what I meant. You won't surpass a game with 10 5 start ratings if you only have 1
 DangerNoodle#5924: Really well made game!!! The sprites and animations are really well made! I would have liked a little "hurt" animation, cause it wasn't clear when I was taking damage. Nice experience overall! Good job! I will leave you a comment and rating right now! Thanks for having sent it to me :D
 MrBen#0001: but ngl man my game looks sick
 CryoTyro#4910: I don't think so but I really don't know ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 Casper#6361: I tend to look more at polish than at art when it comes to presentation. I also favour new developers a little bit as they won't up in the highly competitive ratings anyways
 Fusoy#6101: So games with 300 ratings will have a terrible karma, even if the person rate a thousand game
 Digitaldude555#5515: they did it last year too
 snuffysam#2767: Idk, I’ve made some great games solo and some awful games in teams. This is the first team jam I’ve been in where I felt the entire team was on the same page
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: amount of ratings won't increase your score, it really only affects it if you're under the median
 Nectar#2888: Does it feed into the final rating?
 Fusoy#6101: Karma is a ratio composed of how many game you've rated and commented versus the number of ratings your game has
 Fredison#9375: Yeah, I do tend to be a little pickier when rating games made by very large teams or using a lot of pre-existing assets
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: that stunned me also. tbh I pretty much only play WebGL builds. Too lazy to download everything
 Omniclause#4760: Not your pawn has been my favorite so far and I’d be shocked if it didn’t make top 20
 CryoTyro#4910: points for rating other people's games
 MrBen#0001: I am doing great without that
 akaBl4ck#7384: I played a really cool tower defense game with dices that do different stuff depending on which number they land
 Nectar#2888: What is karma btw I’ve got no idea what it is
 Casper#6361: I have been doing game development on and off as hobby for the past 4 years along with creating mods for games. I've done 6 jams total now, of which 4 GMTK jams
 Redline#7370: just saying a web build is way smaller
 MrBen#0001: idc about webgl lol noone would download 120 mb html game
 Fredison#9375: I wish I had taken the time last night to play some games and collect some early karma, but my brain was so fried from marathon coding that I ended up just curling up with Super Robot Wars all evening, haha
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: it states in the jam page that more ratings increase your "score"
 Valkyrrii#3264: Personally I’d also rate a solo dev 5/5 for mostly good art where I’d rate a large team 3/5 or 4/5. It’s all subjective anyway.
 MrBen#0001: yes it is? itch says it in my stats
 Redline#7370: ben, you don't even have a webgl build, it's practically not possible
 akaBl4ck#7384: I doubt that though
 Wompfbeere#0090: is there a min. view amount you need because if you need to have 5star ratings then one rating with 5 stars will get you there if noone else cares for your game 🤔
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: may I ask how long you guys have been doing this for? Jams I mean
 MrBen#0001: ah yes 101 downloads :)
 FryDev#0372: the Team Bugulon game will probably get in the top 20
 akaBl4ck#7384: Maybe top 500-300
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: not to mention that you can't be good at everything
 Casper#6361: It's always great to see games from new developers, brings back memories from my first jam
 MrBen#0001: im hoping for at least top 200
 dhafo#4640: it doesnt really mean that in practice lol
 akaBl4ck#7384: I hope mine gets top 1k lol
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: Same, but you more people means double the content or half the time investment
 Valkyrrii#3264: I think the gnome game is gonna make top hundred, but I dunno too 20.
 BlankSlate#8922: Some people work better in teams and some work better solo
 MrBen#0001: (mine) not /j
 BadPiggy#5202: You find a lot of jam veterans in LD, but you'll always find a lot of people doing a jam for the first time as well lol
 dhafo#4640: maybe a 2-3 man or something otherwise nah
 PokeNinjaGuy#9592: my prediction is me 🙂 /j
 akaBl4ck#7384: My game has a couple of bugs
 Valkyrrii#3264: I think that’s because solo devs get rated higher for less a lot of the time!
 Nectar#2888: What are your predictions for the top 20 games? Out of curiosity
 MrBen#0001: nah I like working alone. team distracts me ngl
 Uthel#6594: My first one for sure, been making unity games for a while though, a dev buddy suggested I join
 dhafo#4640: i thought LD was more popular among like more established peeps
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: teams always have an advantage no matter what
 BlankSlate#8922: My last game jam game I ended up deleting cause I overscoped and ended up with an overly complicated and unplayable
 Casper#6361: Yeah that happens a lot
 BadPiggy#5202: In big jams like these, you'll always find atleast 40% of peeps doing a jam for the first time lol
You see it more often in LD
 MrBen#0001: ur gamejam game is sick actually 🤩
 masalt#5723: hi
 Albur#4008: Interesting, so the advantages balance the drawbacks. Still, I think that when **art** is taken into account, teams with a delegated artist have an advantage. It’s true GMTK favours innovation, so I’m fine with how this works. 🙂 Actually, I watched the video on the winners for 2021, and there were a lot of ‘loners’ with homemade graphics that fared well.
I’m going back to the heavy testing-reviewing process, bye folks.
 tinderet#7708: that was our big issue too. like, the code behind it was cool, but it wasnt actually... fun to play
 calamitty2#4599: that was our 2019 submission and mark played it on stream only to give up. quick.
 dhafo#4640: i just made a barebones stealth game 😭 but u tab between 2 characters
 Jasper#7906: Yeah, I do a lot of listening without watching when it comes to YT and videos that don't really need the visuals for the most part, so it's also partially on me
 KingLucky#2526: I tried your game, i liked!
 MrBen#0001: me 👀
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: I think this year there were a ton of new devs. Half of the people I've spoken with had never done a jam before, idk if that's always the case
 Uthel#6594: I admit to not knowing how to do it.
 BadPiggy#5202: My game last year was terrible lol. It was hard for me and ended up being impossible for everyone else
 MrBen#0001: yep its cool :D
 NiallCrabtree#2618: Yeah I added in some text to warn people but it might have been too small. Thank you for watching!
 Twelveoclock#2212: Hi folks. If anyone wants to check my game, DM me. Its an enjoyable one 😉
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: it does look kinda creepy
 Casper#6361: That's a bit deceiving though because you need to get mostly 5 stars to actually get such a high rating
 tinderet#7708: our game last year was a bit of an over-ambitious trainwreck so our focus this year was scope & polish
 PlatosMan#2789: And if anyone wants to try mine, lmk and I'll send a DM
 MrBen#0001: when I uploaded my game at first, itch marked it as NSFW. I contacted mods and they fixed it lol
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: silly engines, aren't they? My UI disappeared at one point and I had to redo it. Luckily not a ton of work
 dhafo#4640: dang u have more ratings after the first 24 hrs than my entire game last year 😭
 Jasper#7906: Enjoyed the video! The discord notification sounds in a middle of you talking were annoying, though. Took me way too long to realize that they weren't coming from my discord...
 Nectar#2888: I almost did. But I powered through and I ended up doing well!
 Fredison#9375: It was! But it's also where I met some people I jammed with again later, and had a much better, fulfilling time
 Valkyrrii#3264: And not do the actual jam proper, or only a really short one.
 Casper#6361: Last year I believe the mark for top 100 was 4.01 overall
 PlatosMan#2789: I just finished another batch of ratings. If anyone wants their game reviewed, DM me! 😄
 tinderet#7708: That's a really cool idea -- i think the best part of things like this is that we can be collaborative
 Powercore2000#0189: my internet died in the last hour, it was terrifying lol. Luckily I admined my teams other devs
 BlankSlate#8922: I would've just stopped right then and there
 Valkyrrii#3264: Honestly? Next year I might just toss up a twitch stream where people can request assets or code help.
 Powercore2000#0189: even though their small and rough, having something is better than nothing!
 Nectar#2888: My game almost didn’t come out, godot erased all of my code at one point and I had to redo it all
 tinderet#7708: That's frustrating!!
 dhafo#4640: lol please dm me it too 
 DangerNoodle#5924: For sure! I will try in a while
 Fredison#9375: I once did a week-long jam with a very large team and it was a mixed bag of an experience. I met some good friends there but also clashed with others, and the team leader who brought us all together ended up doing very little actual work
 calamitty2#4599: anyone else make a game with billiard ball like physics using dice?
 LOPSTERu#3902: thas not how you do it
 Powercore2000#0189: man, its nice to actually have gotten something out
 ⲟⲩⲥⲓⲣⲉ#2058: Dm me ur game I have to see this lol
 barret#3612: If you wanna try mine that would be cool
 Uthel#6594: Maybe next year I'll recruit a bunch of my friends who failed/backed out/missed the deadlines as little worker bees 😛
 tinderet#7708: we were 11 random people lol
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: what is consider a big team?
 ⲟⲩⲥⲓⲣⲉ#2058: Yea small teams are good, I couldn't imagine a large team nothing would get done unless it's a studio
 tinderet#7708: we had a pretty big team and it was a lot of delegation. It worked really well, but like, you definitely need a lot of different personality types (somebody that takes charge etc)
 Aiminer357#8033: are the games that usually get to top 100 have a perfect 5/5 score?
 Casper#6361: Defo, though I do consider trying to be a bit more competitive next year in maybe a team of 2 or 3
 Nectar#2888: I agree, having total control made things so much easier
 DangerNoodle#5924: Hello! Anyone wants me to try their game? :D
 tinderet#7708: Yeah, there are tons of 1-2 person teams that made some really innovative entries. you Have the advantage of only really having to manage yourself and your own skills/expectations, and can also make a game thats entirely your taste and vision
 Uthel#6594: biggest advantage of being solo is.. making snap decisions and immediately starting work on them - no discussion required, no communication required, do whatever you like however you like
 MrBen#0001: cool
 ⲟⲩⲥⲓⲣⲉ#2058: I don't think it's unfair, I think it should be rated equally whether it's teams or solo
 dardasaba#9759: He streams random ones, and then plays the top 100 at the end of the voting period
 calamitty2#4599: yeah larger team projects have a leg up there I think but it depends on why your getting into the jam. if you in it to win it by yourself when teams are allowed its kind of a rough road to start.
 Nectar#2888: WAIT REALLY????? NO WAY
 Casper#6361: Top 100
 Fredison#9375: In past years it was the Top 100, I believe
 Valkyrrii#3264: Top rated hundred.
 Relis#1309: i'm guilty. I did everything but the background music. not only i'm not that good, but i surely wouldn't have thetime to do it
 Casper#6361: You might think this is unfair but the point is to inspire good game design which doesn't necessarily require many resources
 MrBen#0001: btw which games does Mark play? Top rated ones or he just picks from all?
 dhafo#4640: there are deff pros and cons to having a team lol
 Menica Folden#4823: Time to make a separate Jam/Compo like for Ludum Dare ?
 Uthel#6594: Time management for me this time was pretty easy - I had been planning for months to stay up the the whole 48 hours, but at about 38 hours I had a stable and tested webgl build, so spent another three hours polishing it up, adding effects and little tweaks - uploaded, submitted, and went to bed at 41 hrs 😛
 Nectar#2888: I did! All by myself :3
 Valkyrrii#3264: No rating differences, though I tend to give small person projects a bit more benefit of the doubt.
 ⲟⲩⲥⲓⲣⲉ#2058: Wouldn't make sense to split up teams vs solo as teams can just say they were made by one person
 MrBen#0001: e
 Casper#6361: Every game is rated equally
 Toboter#5206: Might add it though. Who knows.
 Valkyrrii#3264: I put in 10 minutes during the turn in period to download a tune and a side effect, and toss in a music version.
 Albur#4008: Hello everyone; speaking about teams (I came here to ask), how is this taken into account for judging the games? I am now testing a game made by four people, and it triggered (once more) the question in my brain. As far as I know, there is no separate ranking, so how does this add up?
 Scolon#4218: Ok guys I'm back, how is it going in here
 Casper#6361: It eats into your time very quickly when you realise you have like 24 work hours at best on your own
 Casper#6361: Ended up doing SFX and music as well, a bit rushed though with just 2 or so hours for the entire endeavour
 Toboter#5206: There's data about that, but since most people don't report their fellow devs to itch since the option is kinda hidden, I didn't process it.
 Omegnight#7081: Nice job then 😄
 Uthel#6594: I did, most of the sounds too   😄
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: I didnt put any sound in my game due to time restraints
 Jasper#7906: I have neither music nor sound effects. Originally had it in "created all my music" but changed it to "did not create my music" after the jam, but both are equally valid
 Casper#6361: Someone might have last year's stats
 CryoTyro#4910: I looked at it closer, I'm not so convinced that coolness == karma
its hard to tell because there is no info online about it
 Valkyrrii#3264: Yeah I went in as a solo dev and didn’t do the music since I lost the first 12 hours.
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: Do we have stats about that?
 Uthel#6594: ty, it's a pretty cool one 😄
 Casper#6361: Afaik the majority of games were made by one person
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: I'm maybe not realising how many 1 man team there were
 Peas_N_Carrots#0529: Lmao I want to play dicer arena submitted w one second left
 Toboter#5206: I was in there, without music, only sound effects
 Casper#6361: I did it solo and happened to enough experience to get something acceptable together in an hour but many people do not have time or have little musical experience so it makes a lot of sense to me
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: and most of the game I saw had made their own music during the jam
 Omegnight#7081: Most of "1 people teams" probably didn't do musics themselves
 Jasper#7906: Probably a lot of "no music" in there
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: I think it's low but I may be biased since we had a dedicated guy for that
 Casper#6361: Do you think it's low or high?
 Toboter#5206: A whole 130 lines of crappy Python code 😉
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: Made own music/sound: 49.08% i'm surprised by that stat
 calamitty2#4599: i feel like there is a TON of wordplay on game names this year and i love it!
 Nobody6502#8971: this is incredible
 nicholas#8278: i haven't experienced any lag with opera gx
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: pretty fun game also but it can get frustrating because of some of the level design
 Uthel#6594: strange, my experience has been the opposite, I tend to get better performance with webgl in chrome 🤷‍♂️
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: I love the word-play on that
 filipex2000#1080: I'm a game developer with all skills except for music and writing, I make games alone and with a friend who is a talented musician, writer and 2D animator
I made my first game when I was like 10 or something, now I'm 18, decided to participate in a few game jams this summer to build my portfolio
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713:   the name of the other golf ggame I found is Par-a-Dice
 Maxy#9186: Oh, I'm not talking about your game specifically. I try to play as many submissions as possible, but I noticed that not a single web game that is 3d runs even remotely well on chrome, while they run just fine on firefox
 Uthel#6594: There's a big performance hit as opposed to standalone for sure - for this jam I probably pushed the graphics too far for webgl - it runs fine and it stable, but framerate (on the main menu specifically) is pretty poor. I should have included a standalone version - if you check out my itch page in my discord profile here, I have a couple of super-lightweight webgl physics toys - like Sprocket, very performant
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: apart from that the later levels are decently difficult, but yeah hidden tutorials would have been nice to have
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: The fact that someone submitted a single second before the deadline though
 dhafo#4640: oh the first game i've seen where it gives the "THIS PAGE HAS BEEN QUARANTINED" warning
 BanananaMonke#3591: Cool
 Tibsko77#8462: Sorry, thank you for thé link
 Digitaldude555#5515: I did it face down and not face up, now it works
 Merus#7019: 
 Jasper#7906: 
 PlatosMan#2789: Hi all! I just finished the last batch of people who DM'd me their games. If you want a rating, send a DM my way!
 CryoTyro#4910: oh my god one second before deadline lmao
 LOPSTERu#3902: bruuh
 BanananaMonke#3591: Screenshot?
 Digitaldude555#5515: what....
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: the 6 need to be face up not face down I thing
 BanananaMonke#3591: Yea I am not really good at “hidden tutorials” and the space behind walls is indeed a bit tricky but the streamer I talked about didn’t came that far
 Maxy#9186: Maybe, but literally every web game that is 3d so far just doesn't run even remotely playable for me.
If I use firefox everything's fine
 Minus#1843: 1 second? That's enough time to create AAA game 😂
 Toboter#5206: Also to the guys who submitted 10 minutes after it started.
 Digitaldude555#5515: EXPLAIN TO ME, I GOT THE 6 ON THE BRIGHT PATCH
 Toboter#5206: Personal congrats to the two guys who submitted one second before the Jam ended 😉
 LemonScripts#5768: dam
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: A bit I feel like the first level should restrict a bit more the movement of the player since at first I thought I needed the 6 to be facing down and not up (but that's maybe because i'm bad at english) also there is a level where you cannot see that there is space above some wall so it become hard to get a read on the level, the difficulty of the puzzle seem fine tho
 Uthel#6594: untrue, ive been making 3d webgl games for a while 😛

 BanananaMonke#3591: I think this lays on you tbh I tested it  a billion times
 Maxy#9186: Another problem I have with webGl versions is, that every 3d game doesn't work in chrome
 Spico#6316: 
 dhafo#4640: joe rogan experience in ur game
 BanananaMonke#3591: What?? That has never happened before
 Digitaldude555#5515: bro it doesnt......when I put the 6 on the hole nothing happens
 BanananaMonke#3591: , you played “the perfect dice” right? Can you tell if you had trouble with the difficulty?
 Spico#6316: ^
dont worry about winning, releasing a game in the first place is an accomplishment
 SaadTheGlad#9716: The problem is webgl versions are notorious for being very broken, although the only issues in our game is some audio artifacts and... not enabling scale with screen size on the canvas
 dhafo#4640: damn u got graphics?
 Uthel#6594: neat, remember the name? sounds cool
 Spico#6316: i would sort by karma if i were you (but it doesnt update for some reason)
 SaadTheGlad#9716: I agree with this
 CryoTyro#4910: on the bright side, I think you're more likely to get a thorough/legit review with download onlies :\)
 dhafo#4640: u know i forgot i should try that
 Viciouz6#4491: Regarding webbuild, for some insane reason my game breaks when you use fullscreen... anyone seen anything like that before?
 Jasper#7906: That's just a text thing, though. The link is the same, but the download page *is* the same as the play page for games with a web page, so it's really only the text of the button that's different
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: nvm it wasn't yours I played a 2d variation of that
 Viciouz6#4491: Ah maybe i'm wrong then
 Spico#6316: there are some no web games that are really good, i understand the complaint but its unfortunate for devs that forgot to add a web build/cant
 dhafo#4640: im in the dice flipping family but i dont associate with them, my game is totally different it's like scrabble ok
 Uthel#6594: Maybe, or maybe there's another one with a similar idea Im unaware of 😛 mine's `Die, Golf`
 CryoTyro#4910: I believe that is just another name for karma
tho I could be mistaken 🤔
karma is called coolness in ludum dare so I just assumed
 Viciouz6#4491: It shows some coolness rating aswell?
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: Oh I think I played your game
 Uthel#6594: the first review on mine is the only one ive seen that had similar ideas - golf, but the ball is a die, and power of next shot is determined by previous roll 😄
 CryoTyro#4910: oh I saw that script
doesn't it just show # of ratings + your karma?
 Fredison#9375: Because personally I do welcome constructive criticism, but I know it's likely going to be for things we know about but simply didn't have time to implement before the deadline
 CoolRyan#6539: making notes for us 😉
 Viciouz6#4491: Someone linked a script
 Draconium🪁#9786: There are like three games in my queue that have the same "twist" on the theme
 Fredison#9375: There should probably be a checkbox in the submission form where you can say like "Please be kind" or "Please ROAST ME", lol
 dhafo#4640: yeah i have yet to have any negative feedback 😭 hopefully it's a good thing and it's not just "good game" and 1 stars or something lol
 CryoTyro#4910: how can you see that the ratings are low?
 BanananaMonke#3591: “Fairly roasted”
 Viciouz6#4491: Yeah, i would love to get roasted so i can improve for the next jam
 BanananaMonke#3591: Yep same! I saw like 10 games similar to mine
 dhafo#4640: one of the first games i tried was similar to mine 😭
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: which is a shame because it's way more useful to get critiscim on those type of gamer
 syelan34#3258: Actually I found out that my concept was pretty common thanks to a streamer.
 BanananaMonke#3591: By banananamonke
 Digitaldude555#5515: there are two games named perfect dice
 Viciouz6#4491: Itch comments are not that reliable since people try to be nice due retaliation fears 🙂
 BanananaMonke#3591: :) haha
 BanananaMonke#3591: All the itch comment are nice. But all the other people just roasted me
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: I can relate to the first frame a lot
 BanananaMonke#3591: The name is: “The perfect dice”
 Digitaldude555#5515: also whats the name of the game?
 Digitaldude555#5515: first mistake giving game to streamer.
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: oof what's the name of the game I wanna see a difficult one since I didn't many of those apart from use and a few other
 Fredison#9375: Yeah, popularity can be a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy in jams
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: omg guy,one nitro bought,one nitro offert
 BanananaMonke#3591: One streamer played my game (Barji) and he thought it was too difficult. Then he didn’t even play level 1 and rated 1  1 star and 2 star.
And he didn’t even play more than 5% of the game
 Viciouz6#4491: I think people just spam ratings in the beginning for a high karma/list postings
 PokeNinjaGuy#9592: most rated is crazy, it basically becomes "the most rated gets the most ratings"
 Viciouz6#4491: Maybe disable ratings and reviews until next day of the jam to promote better and fairer rating and reviews?
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: why?
 Viciouz6#4491: Interesting, my initial 8 rating seemed to have been very low, and now it is increasing by people really playing it and give a fair review. I suspect people just spam random games in the beginning without putting that much time and effort a short time after the Jam to just get the popularity going
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: how do you even get more then 10 😦
 BanananaMonke#3591: People are hating on my game
 dhafo#4640:  are u some kind of artist or something smh smh
 Digitaldude555#5515: 16
 BanananaMonke#3591: Lol
 BanananaMonke#3591: Cooool
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: I have 23 so far
24, actually, i just got one lol
 BlankSlate#8922: My cover art is just a pic of an empty board and the name of my game next to some pixel art of dice
 dhafo#4640: with my cover art* i tried to kinda explain my game mechanic by pushing blocks together until it says gmtk jam _____ with the blocks but it's a gif and starts with scattered blocks + doesnt look good when it's just in the comments
 Aiminer357#8033: lol my cover art was made AFTER the jam finished. i was too tired at that point
 BanananaMonke#3591: WoW the most rated game has 500+ ratings???
Lol I got 13
 SaadTheGlad#9716: Np!
 Ian Mykl#4218: thanks for the feedback!
 Digitaldude555#5515: my cover art is literally an art asset I scaled down....
 BlankSlate#8922: My cover art was so last minute
 Valkyrrii#3264: I was _very_ proud of my cover art haha
 SaadTheGlad#9716: I like it, however it would benefit from a bit more focus, you won't benefit from trying to fit everything in your game in the cover art, maybe just the highlight
 NiallCrabtree#2618: Awesome pm me if you want to talk about it after :)
 aflyingpotato#7521: 👀 can you DM it to me? curiosity piqued but i couldn't find it under your username
 Ian Mykl#4218: sure. I can't send images here but the game is linked in my bio, it should also come up if you just type the title in the itch.io search bar if you want to see the cover art better
 Aurélien#3461: Hey ! who made this game name "Ruin the game" ? Is like bowling but whit board game :-))
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: yea, thats why i changed the cover of mine to something better before the voring period started
 CoolRyan#6539: cool! will watch it for my break rn, thx
 dhafo#4640: oh i was meaning to check out yours since u a minijammer
 SaadTheGlad#9716: Can I see it?
 filipex2000#1080: Someone commented ``See you in “The Best Games from GMTK Game Jam 2022”`` under my game, whoever it is, is a legend lmao
 Ian Mykl#4218: for sure. I actually surprised myself with the cover art/banner this time given I'm not normally good at art-ing
 Redline#7370: ok I'm at 11 rated, I want to hit at least 20
 dhafo#4640: honestly i'm not sure i'm happy with mine
 SaadTheGlad#9716: Cover art is extremely important in jams like these
 OrangoMango#0973: Could someone please download my game and see if it lags? It seems like it's lagging. Please DM me
 dhafo#4640: 6000 games and u can only tell by cover art
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: Have to admit, thats very samrt lol
 dhafo#4640: ahh it's frustrating not knowing what is good or not lolol
Made a devlog about the weekend! Hopefully you guys find it interesting :)
 Ian Mykl#4218: 36 so far, but I need to stop and do the whole "go to work" thing which is kinda cringe if you ask me but I guess whoever designed society didn't ask me because here we are
 CoolRyan#6539: i've only played a few - i keep making notes and outlines for my group to keep us going strong haha
 Galse#8611: I mean, he did so for the last two years, I'm sure, so ..
 dhafo#4640: only 14 but i try to write some kind of feedback for each
 Aiminer357#8033: 6k games in 7 days. 1k a day. you could play a game for 10 seconds and then leave a review 🙂
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: How many games have you guys rated? Ive rated 29 so far
 Valkyrrii#3264: I haven't heard anything either way, so who knows.
 dhafo#4640: the first random game i tried that wasnt from a dm or someone i know turned out to be kinda bad and didnt follow the theme hopefully i get luckier
 Galse#8611: Anyone knows if Mark will also be playing random games on stream this year?
 dhafo#4640: ok i gotta go back to actually playing some morre games lol
 CoolRyan#6539: i've been debating how to rate them cuz i think anything some one is able to submit is cool! lol - want to encourage people to keep going with more time and more jams haha
 Ian Mykl#4218: true! more options are always better.
In my case I only had time to make windows + html but would have liked linux and mac too 
 FancyReckless#2560: depeneds. this is such a big jam I think a lot of the things work differently here. In some jams there's just few people that will give all 1s to anyone but themselves. Good luck with that for 6k games 😄
 Danny Dan Dan#6699: The grid 😭
 dhafo#4640: feels like people who take the effort to download are also more likely to leave a comment
 Aiminer357#8033: ah oh well, should have done downloadable and webgl
 Kipash#0301: which one ? 😦  ❤️
 CoolRyan#6539: i get it - was just a convo point is all 😉 both is probably best for stability anyway as some will have trouble with one over other right?
 Toboter#5206: Holy crap, there's so much more data in that JSON file! I can parse the answers to the "did you make your own art/music" survey, the Karma each entry has, which platforms it's on, and when it was submitted! Brb writing code 😉
 CadenJO [DM to trade ratings]#2365: can you sort submissions by how many ratings they have?
 dhafo#4640: from my current experience it seems like that lol, like last jam i had more ratings but only like 3 comments, this time i have so many comments already
 CoolRyan#6539: right been trouble shooting that - pogi's one right?
 Valkyrrii#3264: What was it for you?
 Ian Mykl#4218: honestly not trying to game the system that hard lol, I just want people to play & (hopefully) enjoy something I made
 Omniclause#4760: I played that dice factory game for over 30 minutes. It’s so simple it doesn’t make sense how addicting it is.
 Digitaldude555#5515: there always is
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: theres only one DICERPUNK that shows up, but the games looks interesting nonetheless
 Valkyrrii#3264: what relis said. doing downloadable only won't hurt your chances at winning if you've got a real good game, and troll reviews tend to hit more popular games.
 Danny Dan Dan#6699: No...
I just found out Unity has a built in component which would have saved me like half the time I spent coding during the jam
 dhafo#4640: and yet higher chance to get a higher score cause the trolls are more likely to look at the ones with a lot of ratings lol
 CoolRyan#6539: yeah there's a 'science of game jams' youtube vid - they said do win exe for better ratings, look more pro, etc
 FancyReckless#2560: the less ratings you have the more troll ratings weigh you down
 dhafo#4640: the more ratings u get the more likely u prob are to attract those weirdly random 1 star ones
 Relis#1309: i think that also there's a kind of wall with downloadable, after you get some comments of people playing, i guess others are less suspicious of the exe
 Nobody6502#8971: 12 ratings 👀
 dhafo#4640: honestly maybe i'm copium but the ratings u lose to web probably dont matter in the grand scheme, like if ur game is good u'll still get like 20 5stars instead of idk like 40
 FancyReckless#2560: tho if you don't have it and want to play a lot of games quick, then download itch.io client
 Valkyrrii#3264: It'll definitely get you more reviews at least :p
 Tyler Hunter#0474: 2bit pixel art at that.
 FancyReckless#2560: browser build is so important in the jam
 CoolRyan#6539: yeah the more recent submission won't show up in search for some reason - but if you go to search for 'chewbaku' and look at their page it shows on the right panel
 Tyler Hunter#0474: That’s why I stuck to pixel art :/
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: damn lol
I did find some jams to be very addicting though
 MrBen#0001: fair
 dhafo#4640: tbf i did play 1 jam game for 1 hour lol
 Kipash#0301: that's true. We had to make a whole different visuals because we've wrongly assumed that Unity's VFX Graph is supported on WebGL. 😦
But we luckily were able to get to decent visuals right around the end 🙂
EDIT: I also read `imperative` as `impressive` 😠
 Fusoy#6101: A browser build will make you have more ratings and comments, but it's definitely not a factor for winning
 Tyler Hunter#0474: Interesting.
 Valkyrrii#3264: Makes sense, a lot of people are understandably uncomfortable with downloading random exe files. but more reviews doesn't equal a better rating :p
 Aiminer357#8033: a key point is you want the game to be as accessible as possible. you need to increase the likelihood of someone actually playing the game and decrease the steps to get there. so i would prioritise that
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: We don't police DMs so if you want to play someone's jam game and rate it in order to get feedback on a game you made then that's your choice. What you can't do is advertise non-jam games in the discord or post links on jam pages to fixed versions of games
 Aurélien#3461: i have 3 review now ! thank you anonymous stranger !
 MrBen#0001: yeah I wanted to do a html 5 ue game but:
a) I ran out of time
b) noone will download 120 mb html game
 dhafo#4640: feels like i've been rating forever now and i'm only at 14 lol
 SaadTheGlad#9716: Because last year's games' winners were mostly downloadble
 SaadTheGlad#9716: Your eally think so?
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: So i just tried playing your game, and whenever i press Play, i get an error message in the other window:
ERROR: Cannot open file 'res://scenes/mainScenes/Player.tscn'.

 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: from what i've seen only half of our views downloaded the executable so that's a  lot of review lost
 octartis#5305: yeah, browser games usually get more ratings, I did an html5 build but it had an engine bug...
 Tyler Hunter#0474: As I go through and play games I’ve realized one thing.  It is absolutely imperative you make your jam game browser playable.  No matter the jam.
 dhafo#4640: tbf i usually only do web builds but this time i just couldnt
 ⲟⲩⲥⲓⲣⲉ#2058: That's really cool
 Toboter#5206: But if you are above the Median, it means more than 50% of people have less ratings than you.
 CoolRyan#6539: eh - we're all super new so - i tried to take a sorta project lead but - it can work i bet if there's prep and assigned workspace with outlines and game jam experience etc sure - was really cool and intense towards the end for sure!
 octartis#5305: yeah, I wanted to correct my previous statement
 Toboter#5206: You get some score detraction if you are far below median, otherwise people who just happen to have only one 5/5 score would win easily.
 SilentProtag#8135:  Sorry to ping you directly, but I just want to confirm the above question regarding "you can still ask for feedback for rates in DMs", Does that mean if someone asks about the game in discord DMs, we can send them a fixed version, as long as we don't explicitly say that on the Itchio page? I'm not quite sure what you meant
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: yes that's the definition of the median
 Amitgep#9295: but you have more ratings than most that's median I think
 octartis#5305: oh then I'm a little below average at 8 ratings against 9
 ⲟⲩⲥⲓⲣⲉ#2058: What was it like working with 12 people? Was someone managing them?
 Scolon#4218: Reminder that the number of ratings you get has seemingly no correlation to your chances of winning
You can view the results of any of the previous GMTKs and most of the winners have a very average or slightly above average number of rates.
 octartis#5305: ooooh
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: and the average is 9 rip
 Fusoy#6101: It means 50% of games have less than 6 ratings and the other 50% of games have more than 6 ratings
 CoolRyan#6539: yup! don't know if we can post here but DICERPUNK is us - we ended up with two entries of same game, different build - one a few hours early other last minute upload lol
 octartis#5305: wait what's median?
 jarrpa#6782: tyty 👍
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: That would be fine
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: git hub work really well as long as you can manage branch
 CoolRyan#6539: we're a pretty chill and helpful group so wanted to share!
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: Did you submit a game?
 calamitty2#4599: this is really cool. would love occasional updates.
 Amitgep#9295: damn average rating is 9? I got 3 lol
probably cuz I didn't do browser version
 CoolRyan#6539: by the end of it, ya! lol - I kept an eye open for lost souls here in the lf team chan and nabbed up 4 more in the final hours 😉
 jarrpa#6782: Legit. What about a retrospective devlog on how the event went and technical hurdles that kept us from publishing a working build, as long as it contains no media or links to assets/builds?
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: you had 12 people on your team!?
 Amitgep#9295: cool
 octartis#5305: yay, I'm a little above median 👍
 CoolRyan#6539: Hey game devs, my group of 12, all green & new, are searching for a free (if at all possible) shared workspace that adapts to game jam teams.
This weekend's jam made it clear it’s best if we can adopt a single collaboration space for all our needs as our biggest project issue was all our differing personal workflow tools.
Notion Milanote Google Jamboard / Google Workspace Trello Miro Github - a bit overwhelmed here.
Any advice for an entry level casual group - the more simple & easier to use the better. Please direct reply or dm - tia!

 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: as far as we know
 Delphine Noel#1196: Hello everyone
 octartis#5305: hooooly shi... 55.3K ratings already, woah
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: yea i think so
 Digitaldude555#5515: last year 150k ratings
 Scolon#4218: Yes
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Correct. We can't guarantee people won't rate you based on the updated version and it explicitly breaks the rules so you could get disqualified. much safer to just be patient. Upload the devlog and the new version when the jam is finished
 Aiminer357#8033: Is mark gonna stream himself playing games like last year?
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: yea, but ratings have really slowed down
 Ian Mykl#4218: how often something is used. In general people don't like it when something has too hig of a payrate because it means the game is not diverse enough
 Scolon#4218: Wow we're already at 55k ratings total with 6 days left
 Spaceshark YT#4155: ok
 aflyingpotato#7521: I'm on Mac! DM me
 calamitty2#4599: haha so true
 Aurélien#3461: do other people have only 2 notes on their game ?
 Aiminer357#8033: what are playrates?
 cheesepizza#3335: Be like me , slept for 12 hours straight and already thinks i won 🥰
 Ian Mykl#4218: when in ccg communities people are always on about playrates. Here the thing is play/rate
 MrBen#0001: ok
 Spaceshark YT#4155: well it works on windows its just the player cant jump
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: You've just asked if people want to, then said you want people to notice you, then asked if someone can review you when they are talking to someone else.
Give it a rest
 Aiminer357#8033: mega oof. the game has to be windows playable
 MrBen#0001: oof
 Spaceshark YT#4155: is anyone on a mac? My jam game has an error with the windows build so only mac users can play/rate my game.
 MrBen#0001: ye I will stop 😭
 jarrpa#6782: Okay, so leave the devlog for when we can upload new versions after the jam?
 calamitty2#4599: yeah i write reviews for all games i play. just seems fair
 JuliusCube#8501: thats a little very too much and also no its not 1-2 hours
 MrBen#0001: then I will stop
 SilentProtag#8135: Alright, so it sounds like what we should do is:
* Upload a gameplay video
* Add to the description to DM for feedback and rates. Does that mean we send them the fixed game directly via DM, if they're interested?
Is that correct?
 Redline#7370: you just did it 3 times in the past 5 minutes
 cheesepizza#3335: Uff
 PatateNouille#5627: what kind of feedback do you want to ask for if the game doesn't even launch ? "was the name alright ?" 😂
 MrBen#0001: I do it like once for 1-2 hours
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Its fine to ask or respond to r4r but don't overdo it as it becomes spam
 Aiminer357#8033: lol if you insist
 Redline#7370: ben sotp
 MrBen#0001: can you also review mine?
 calamitty2#4599: you rate/comment mine and i will play yours. swaps are fun.
 Sir Tetris#1382: dm me the link, ill review it after finishing up my queue
 RomketMan#0055: finished work now, time to try out some other games 🙂
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: actually, it does, on the Metadata tab, but most people don't bother filling it in
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Do not do this
 dhafo#4640: all i want is some decent feedback lol feels like all my comments are just people enjoying my game i have yet to have anyone make fun of my bad game 😭
 MrBen#0001: I want to be noticed 😭 This is my first jam
 dhafo#4640: ben u have so many ratings already 😭 why do u want mine
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: No please don't. You can still ask for feedback for rates in DMs etc but don't put it on your itch page just wait for voting to be over
 jarrpa#6782: I'm in the same boat as  .The rules say it's not allowed to upload new binaries for evaluation, but I'm planning on publishing a devlog with screens and a link to an actual working build, with giant text saying **not available for evaluation in the game jam**. I'll be updating the game after the game jam is over, while trying to preserve the work and version that did make it into the jam.
 calamitty2#4599: i would upload a video to your page of gameplay so they can see it at least.
 Redline#7370: not yet just started rating
 MrBen#0001: k
 JuliusCube#8501: redline have you played my game and also ben please stop promoting your game it literally does nothing
 Redline#7370: ben that's not how you promote your game and you should stop
 Beeg scarf#3571: Im good
 MrBen#0001: anyone wants to play my game? 👀
 Sir Tetris#1382: im pretty sure the rules say it's not allowed (even if you already know youre disqualified)
 OrangoMango#0973: yeah, the questionnaire asked it so I was wondering if there will be a global stats
 SilentProtag#8135: Hey guys, got a question. Our submission is totally busted, as in the EXE crashes on run. We know we're going to be disqualified anyway for having a broken game, but can we add a link to a fixed submission on our game page? It kinda would feel like a wasted effort if people only see the crash error, but we totally get if that's not possible
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: itch doesn't record game engine used it has no way of knowing that. Mark does give out a questionnaire about the jam where he will show some of those types of stats
 SaadTheGlad#9716: If anybody would like to DM swap hmu!
 nicholas#8278: unity
 Scolon#4218: I mean it's pretty obvious what the most popular used engines were anyway
 uturn#2245: You can also list others as a contributor and join the jam as individuals.  You just add admins to your game page.  I assume you can get data from itch that way.
 LOPSTERu#3902: most of the time its pretty obvious what game engine was used
 Beeg scarf#3571: It says private for a reason
 OrangoMango#0973: Will the stats like game engine used be public?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: they do that, if you are under the median your score is adjusted
 Aeph#4622: I’m not sure but I would assume the majority of teams uploaded from a single itch account also
 MrBen#0001: mostly alone probly
 nizbel#9979: But what was the average team size?
 shenalkm#1022: Woah thanks for the explanation!
This makes a lot of sense!
They should be doing something like this, all the submissions less than the median number of ratings are averaged out with jam average ratings until they hit the median
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: People generally use least ratings if anything so that they can give some views and feedback to people who are seen less
 Viola_Buddy#6763: Note as well that a single 5-star rating would have a final score of 4 under this system (average of 3 and 5), which is actually less than that 5,5,4,4,4,4 example
 Aeph#4622: That’s true, there were around 20k participants last year but only 5k projects
 Scolon#4218: Yeah having something playable submitted should only put you like top 80-ish%
 Nectar#2888: Ahhh I see, that seems a bit more realistic
 uturn#2245: I think I worded that incorrectly.  I meant of the people that start the weekend with the intent to participate, ~33% submit a game.
 Maxy#9186: From what I heard people do apparently
 cheesepizza#3335: Okay
 Kipash#0301: sry, wrong reply 😄 ..
 nizbel#9979: But do many people use that sorting order?
 Acu1000#5560: rating a heavily rated game doesnt affect the median so its fine
 oa#7680: games are bad for making art then. all you get is extra immersion. you sacrifice good pacing, control over the story, and are forced to make everything entertaining for that alone.
 Aeph#4622: I highly disagree. Maybe different levels/ styles of art but some are beautiful masterpieces and some are amazing narratives which is an art in itself
 Scolon#4218: I don't think it's that high
 cheesepizza#3335: What
 Maxy#9186: Random idea, but having you be unable to sort by ratings during the rating period would most likely even them out quite a bit
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Wait what
 Kipash#0301: 28
 Nectar#2888: Wow, really?? I had no idea that many struggled to submit properly
 Viola_Buddy#6763: If you get a total of three ratings that are 5, 4, and 4, your final tallied score would add an additional 3-star rating, so it'd be the average of 3,5,4,4 (so this final score is 4). As you get more and more ratings, that one additional default 3-star rating gets more and more "washed out" in the average. If you have six ratings of 5,5,4,4,4,4, then your final score is the average of all those as well as an additional 3 (so 3,5,5,4,4,4,4) which is 4.14.
 FancyReckless#2560: I actually think they kinda are
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: they definitely are
 uturn#2245: Yeah, just a working submission is a lot.  Immediately puts you in the top 33%, if I heard  correctly.
 oa#7680: games aren't art
 Scolon#4218: I've rated 43
Reminder to try and rate games that have low ratings before others!
 Aeph#4622: Probably around 15/20? Would’ve done more but been quite busy
 Acu1000#5560: You could use more confidence
 cheesepizza#3335: Sorry i wanted to messge him from the bio
 Redline#7370: how many games have you guys rated so far?
 FancyReckless#2560: What should I think when all the jam I thought I lost my creativity and everyone in my game comments say it's very creative? 😅
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: use DMs or put your game in your bio not in chat
 Nectar#2888: Absolutely, I agree! I think I just got really lucky, and im thankful for all the recognition I’ve been getting! Nobody should be discouraged right now, as there are over 6000 games, so it makes sense to have a relatively lower average of ratings. You all did wonderfully and you should be proud!
 Kipash#0301: 👍
 Boykala#8716: Do the ratings change after they're revealed? I went back to check our ranking from last year and it's quite a bit lower than what I remember. I checked and I have screenshots of us right after the ratings came out and they're much higher than they are now. I'm kind of confused.
 Nectar#2888: I’ve got VSC, thanks for the tips I’ll figure out the rest from here
 uturn#2245: Getting to the popular page initially is a difficult ask for most people - the social media following (or really solid art/publishing package) can be the foot in the door to keep the snowball rolling.  I'm not citing it as a negative or anything - just trying to remind people that the average game doesn't have more than 10 ratings right now, and not to be discouraged.
 shenalkm#1022: could you elaborate more on this with a simple example?
didn't understand
 Kipash#0301: You will need a Visual Studio 2022 for that.
Or just rewrite that code in the programming language of your choice 👍
 calamitty2#4599: bold contrast (dark light) large letters that are easily readable.
 Viola_Buddy#6763: Oh that'd make sense. For the record, a standard way of accounting for a low/variable number of votes is to start everyone off with an additional hidden exactly-neutral vote (in this case, 3 stars for each category), so it's probably something based on this/similar to this.
 Digitaldude555#5515: ok
 Syton#9947: Sorry.. I'll
 cheesepizza#3335: I dm you
 akaBl4ck#7384: did anyone play AIA's/n8dev's/Icoso's game?
 Beeg scarf#3571: Any tips on making good cover art
 ⲟⲩⲥⲓⲣⲉ#2058: Cover art goes longer cuz they have to hover over to see the gif, but I guess a gif helps get the actual click
 nizbel#9979: It helps but a pretty cover art also goes a long way
 Nectar#2888: Despite my following on socials most of my recognition came through the game jam popular page itself
 calamitty2#4599: honestly i dont care about winning as much as just getting some feedback. what about you?
 SAFT_Morlol#2702: Nope, but is it like really that extrem?
 uturn#2245: Commenting on other games, mainly.  Hopped in a couple streams.  The big numbers on the front page tend to have some sort of social media following already, though as with most generalizations, that's not entirely true.
 Nectar#2888: Never done something like that before so I had no idea what to do with the code
 shenalkm#1022: not really, its based on a secret algorithm by itch
 akaBl4ck#7384: do you have a web build?
 Sir Tetris#1382: luck mostly
 calamitty2#4599: nope look at the gtmk rules for details on rating
 Kipash#0301: It's C#, create a Console project ideally same as me on .NET 6.
Request the url in the browser and CTRL+F your name or the name of the project. Copy the jam id and insert it into the code. That's it. Then just run it.
Or what exactly is the issue?
 Woahsea#4308: it takes into account the number of ratings
 uturn#2245: Same!
 SAFT_Morlol#2702: How did you all manage to get like over 10 ratings? I'm stuck at 2
 Michel#2879: my connection is really bad. feels sad not being able to rate much games D:
 OrangoMango#0973: if someone gets 1 vote and it's 5 stars he wins?
 Nectar#2888: I’ll dm it to you once you accept my friend req
 calamitty2#4599: anyone that rates/comments on my game, i try to go and play rate comment theirs.
search Seum to find roll-o-seum if you want to. ill check em out after work.
 Scolon#4218: No it's who has the most amount of plays
 Woahsea#4308: is the popular sort option the current ranking?
 Occelot Dan#3777:  I didn't submit anything, but I'm building a queue of games to review if you want to send yours my way! (Same for anyone else who sees this)
Update, I'm a fool who did not read your bio lmao
 Nectar#2888: Can you explain how to use this? I’m a bit confused
 Aeph#4622: My bad!
 Kritical#4329: Dm me your games lets trade, i will play them when i wake up
 tinderet#7708: I'll shoot you ours 🙂
 akaBl4ck#7384: i'm at 15, would like to get a few more
 Lighted#2578: ye, i just do a one way trade :P, i do not want to feel like i am forcing people to play my game .-.
 SAFT_Morlol#2702:  btw
 uturn#2245: I'm at 11.  The average is something like 8-9, based on the reported info
 Scolon#4218: oof
 calamitty2#4599: i like trading since its fun to see others projects.
 Nectar#2888: I’m at 52 right now, going steady. I’m really hopeful that all will go well
 Maxy#9186: I'm currently trying to give the low rated windows games some loves, and it turns out a lot of people didn't even set their games to published, so you can't even download them : (
 SAFT_Morlol#2702: Why not?
 Pudigor#4425: I dont remember well, If I just see my game on that video I already consider myself a winner
 Lighted#2578: I can play others games, as well, I have a lot of time, not a trade really :P
 Scolon#4218: Also yeah the number of ratings you get doesn't mean that much in terms of winning
You generally want an average-ish number of ratings
30-50 should be good enough for an accurate score but also not too much that it'll be difficult to win
 nizbel#9979: Yup
 MrBen#0001: me
 Aeph#4622: Sure!
 uturn#2245: Happy to!  (Goes for anyone else that would like to, I'll put together a queue)
 Syton#9947: Anyone want to trade review? Kinda hard to get your game noticed in so many other games
 akaBl4ck#7384: yeah i have it's really good
 MrBen#0001: Im hoping for 70 at the end of the voting
 Scolon#4218: pip factory is definitely top 100
 Acu1000#5560: Thats a pretty high amount rn
 Lighted#2578: there is no one winner from what i remember (i think every game on the video is a winner, tho i am not sure)
 Pudigor#4425: have you guys played pip factory? im rooting for that game!! its addictive lol
 MrBen#0001: 30 reviews 🌝
 shenalkm#1022: CasperCaper17 on twitch played mine
we can submit our game link via a google form
had to wait 3 hours for him to get to my game 😅 so it wud be better if there was a payment system to jump the que 😅
 Lighted#2578: i  think 10 is the minimum or something .-. (there was something last or 2 years ago with a channel for games below 10 ratings )
 Acu1000#5560: they seem to be liking it so far
 Pudigor#4425: by the way
 Nectar#2888: Thank you mark love you mwah
 MrBen#0001: I hope people will like my LIMBO style game 👍
 SAFT_Morlol#2702: So there is math behind the scence that balances out the diffrences in popularity?
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: If I get top 4000 I'm happy
 BlankSlate#8922: Honestly seeing somebody play my game live would give so much dopamine
 Mark Brown#6982: 
 MrBen#0001: same
 Nectar#2888: Are there streamers or YouTubers playing the submissions? I’d love to see people trying them out
 Pudigor#4425: oh really? thats reassurring lol, actually Im quite happy with how everything turned out already
 nizbel#9979: Sounds like a dream
 shenalkm#1022: Not gonna lie, getting the feedback on a stream is gold
seeing people play your game
willing to even pay to play 🙂
 MMG#7170: it appears to have been taken down already
 dhafo#4640: my goal by the end is 20 lolol
 Nectar#2888: I’ll be plenty happy if I make the top 100, and if I don’t, it was a fun experience and I’ll do it again next year!
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: yeah my brain is barely functioning right now
 BlankSlate#8922: I personally want more people to play my game so that I could get as much feedback as possible
 Acu1000#5560: Oh well, Im no. 92 on popular, didnt expect that
 Kipash#0301: brrr
 dhafo#4640: cause the dopamine
 MMG#7170: I'll check the ones i've rated
 RedTeapot#1960: Because the number go brrr
 Sir Tetris#1382: yeah the games ranked least will probably just be broken games you cant play
 shenalkm#1022: that's crazy - then why are people taking so much effort to get more ratings? 😅
 MMG#7170: ofc
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: If it's a required payment and not a suggested donation, report the game - the rules say everyone must be able to play the game for free
 Fusoy#6101: Probably a broken game that got the least amount of ratings
 Nectar#2888: I’m aware that popular isn’t rank, it’s just nice to see something I’ve made do well regardless
 dhafo#4640: #1 for originality with 18 ratings lol 4.7 avg
 shenalkm#1022: 18 x 5 star ratings > 100 x 4 star ratings?
 RedTeapot#1960: I feel like I ran out of brain
 akaBl4ck#7384: i wonder who will get last place 💀
 MMG#7170: i saw a submission in my cue that was 5 dollars 💀
 dhafo#4640: tongue tied
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: How is everyone doing today?
 Kipash#0301: Here you can use the API to get that information.
 shenalkm#1022: really?
 ⲟⲩⲥⲓⲣⲉ#2058: Yea ppl confuse the popular with "currently winning the jam" every year lol
 dhafo#4640: last year someone won with 18 ratings so u dont gotta tryhard that much on the ratings haha
 Pudigor#4425: you cant really lol I jsut counted on the popular page
 akaBl4ck#7384: Just randomize the submissions
 MMG#7170: keep in mind you could be in the top 10 rank wise and still not win or place overall
 Viciouz6#4491:  popular is not a indication of rank tough
 Tapu#9161: Someone had made a script for looking up
I saw it last jam
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: That's gonna take a loooong time for me
 Nectar#2888: Pretty much 🥲
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: And then just scroll down or?
 BlankSlate#8922: Which game? I am super curious now
 Pudigor#4425: just did it!
 Nectar#2888: Sort by popular on the submissions page
 Lighted#2578: that is a good sign LOL
 tinderet#7708: as the art director/one who pumped out most of the assets i was, it was quite funny
 Viciouz6#4491:  how can you see what spot you are on?
 Sir Tetris#1382: you can see your ranking?
 Pudigor#4425: 487th ;-;
 BlankSlate#8922: I would honestly be super flattered
 CryoTyro#4910: I feel that! People were surprised for ours but its because we had a dedicated artist
 Acu1000#5560: hold on I cant dm you for some reason even tho I have dms enabled
 Viciouz6#4491: I need my daily dose of that sweet reviews, anyone want to review for my review? DM me
 Digitaldude555#5515: yeah go ahead
 BlankSlate#8922: All of the comments have been super kind and provide some very useful feedback
 PlatosMan#2789: Yep. Go ahead. I just got a bunch so I'm doing them one by one. I'll get to yours tho I promise
 dhafo#4640: lol can i send u my before and after i find it really funny
 MrBen#0001: Anyone wants to play my game?
 tinderet#7708: we had a few people accuse us of lying about making our assets because there were too many hahaha
 Nectar#2888: Absolutely! Accept my friend req and I’ll dm you a link!
 ⲟⲩⲥⲓⲣⲉ#2058: Just a heads up, the popular is based on views/rating count, not score
 Ian Mykl#4218: It depends, if visuals a re a big part of the game then I strongly prefer original art. But if it's stuff like basic UI elements etc preexisting stuff is fine. Plus as always gameplay is king
 Art Man Oil#5039: I was listening to lofi and when i stopped spacing out pixelart appeared
 Acu1000#5560: are your DMs are open?
 Digitaldude555#5515: I appreciate the effort you put if you made your own art
 CryoTyro#4910: same situation here!
 Lighted#2578: would u have the time tho
 Madness#5032: How to check what place your game is on?
 tinderet#7708: would you mind DMing me your game? I'd love to take a crack at it
 Ry'Hz#2125: I regret so hard not going for my open world rpg dice game idea
 MrBen#0001: play mine 😏
You will love LIMBO style
 Nectar#2888: That’s great to hear! Love hearing about positive feedback, it’s always encouraging!
 BadPiggy#5202: As long as the presentation is consistent, idc lol
 Digitaldude555#5515: oh man I can give you one.
 dhafo#4640: i was listening to deus ex soundtrack during jam and accidently made pixel deus ex
 Nobody6502#8971: ayo what up
 Lighted#2578: matters if it matches together or not
 PlatosMan#2789: Definitely. I'm sitting bored at work rn so if anyone wants feedback, DM me rn
 Relis#1309: ❤️ again you're being too kind
 CryoTyro#4910: I *may* take a star off presentation because I feel like making the art in the jam window is more impressive
 Nectar#2888: I’ve had lots like that too. Really showed me the flaws in my game in the best way possible. The feedback is wonderful!
 Art Man Oil#5039: TRUEE
 cheesepizza#3335: Same with my music lol
 Relis#1309: do it  this guy really care and he's awesome
 dhafo#4640: i just did pixel art and people seem to like my game
 Acu1000#5560: can you review mine too?
 Sir Tetris#1382: our game is doing fine with 15 ratings so far but very positive reviews
 Nectar#2888: That’s a great attitude to have! It’s fun just to submit a game and challenge yourself, see what you can do!
 tinderet#7708: We've had some really kind ones honestly, and lots of constructive criticism/ideas for pushing it further which is really nice to see
 cheesepizza#3335: We  got 0 lol
 PlatosMan#2789: THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST GAMES THIS JAM AND MORE PEOPLE NEED TO PLAY IT!!!!!!
 syelan34#3258: The problem is it’s not very intuitive and kind of hard to explain, and I didn’t have a chance to submit the version with a visual indicator of where the player will move
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: It'd be hard to convince me to give 5 for Presentation with third-party art.
 PlatosMan#2789: DM me your game and I'll review it
 Relis#1309: me sitting here happy with my 5 ratings
 Chazi b#4006: My WebGL build didn't work so I'm windows only, only have 2 ratings. Oh well, honestly submitting something was a win for me 🙂
 Pudigor#4425: my dream... Im fighting for those reviews...
 Nectar#2888: Go to the submissions page, and sort by popular
 akaBl4ck#7384: oh nice
 dhafo#4640: do you guys care about the preexisting art? i dont think i ever pay attention to it even tho i made all my own art lol
 MrBen#0001: wow I have 29 reviews
 krisis in a jar#0904: Didn't know you could see your place
 cheesepizza#3335: Logical
 syelan34#3258: You are a die, and when you move in a direction the number on it changes like it would on a die, and you move as much as the number on the die
 Acu1000#5560: wait im dum
 Pudigor#4425: might be error if it got 0 installs
 shenalkm#1022: 0/0 😅
 Nectar#2888: How is everyone’s game doing? I’m super excited to be among the top 100 right now at 14th on the popular list. I’m curious how you all are doing? What are some reviews that have stood out to you?
 cheesepizza#3335: Its not error , it will be 0
 Acu1000#5560: then my CPI is ERROR because I spent 0$
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: what's the concept?
 akaBl4ck#7384: what is it?
 syelan34#3258: I thought my game concept was somewhat unique but apparently it’s pretty common
 cheesepizza#3335: People need to understand buisness analytics after all 😂
 FryDev#0372: honestly, the CTR remake was better than the CTR original, honestly
 shenalkm#1022: CPI is cost per install
if you spend 100$ on marketing & got 10 installs, then 10$ CPI
 akaBl4ck#7384: how do you see CPI
 Lighted#2578: the most important stat of them all
 cheesepizza#3335: Lmao
 tinderet#7708: hahah you're right! some are pretty clever with the theme. some people think our game is a sim because of the art style but it's got a battle system and encounters, i swear :''')
 syelan34#3258: No CPI not CTR
 akaBl4ck#7384: i got good CTR
 Sir Tetris#1382: crash team racing
 Acu1000#5560: ok but what's CTR
 shenalkm#1022: CTR is click thru rate (if you show an ad to 100 people & 3 people click on it, then its 3% CTR)
 Art Man Oil#5039: Ours has a bug where a ball gets suck on a peg for too long so you have to restart
pain
 Mark Brown#6982: people keep asking "what's CTR", "what's CTR", "what's CTR". for the LAST time people, it stands for "Crash Team Racing"
 Acu1000#5560: rip, poor dude didnt playtest enough
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: Physically unsolvable and admitted by the author.
 syelan34#3258: What’s CPI?
 shenalkm#1022: Not really
over 3% is good
not that accurate tho - better to go for CPI whenever possible
 Acu1000#5560: Truly unsolvable or just too hard
 uturn#2245: I'm super surprised at the sheer number of dating sims I've seen
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: Stumbled upon a game with an unsolvable puzzle quite early on. F.
 Digitaldude555#5515: where are the dating sims
 Acu1000#5560: people have made literal dating simulators for this jam so a chess game is nothing special
 CryoTyro#4910: its a fusion 😋
 shenalkm#1022: I'm heading a small 5 person mobile game dev studio. We have made 100+ protos over the past 2 years & few games with over 1 million downloads.
Participated in this year's jam & it's not that good compared to a lot of submissions I played 😁 So I don't think there would be a big difference even if a top studio  joins the jam - 48h jam is different to the usual game dev process
 syelan34#3258: Click through rate, the number of people who have clicked on it comparend to the number who have seen it on their page
 Digitaldude555#5515: chess game? but its dice theme how can it be
 akaBl4ck#7384: decent
 CryoTyro#4910: in our game we didn't make it so pawns promote to a new piece when they reach the end of the board 🙃
 Pudigor#4425: what is CTR?
 Digitaldude555#5515: no.
 Kritical#4329: Feedback for when the player takes damage i didnt forget i didnt have time
 syelan34#3258: Yep, undo button and being able to see where the player will end up. As soon as the jam ends I’m updating it
 Acu1000#5560: is 0.92% CTR good?
 tinderet#7708: not every player, but some of the reviews that give critique on how to expand our idea usually include a few features we thought of but had to cut for scope
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: I don't think that will cause issues, but links to updated versions most definitely would
 Acu1000#5560: undo button 😩
 Digitaldude555#5515: no, but what feature?
 honiemun#0001: a win state :)
 CryoTyro#4910: anyone have a feature they forgot to include in their game that every player asks for? lol
 syelan34#3258: I did put an image of the updated ui in a reply to someone, hopefully that doesn’t cause a problem either
 NalaFala38290#9305: being a solo dev is more stressful
 akaBl4ck#7384: omg he swear???
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: The only thing I expect of a solo dev is having a good concept I don't really care how good it's executed, as long as it's interesting
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: The expectations from a solo dev and a team are different. That said, a well-coordinated team is more likely to make a three 5-star game than a solo dev.
 tinderet#7708: oh, really? it's weird because i come from the art side so i'm used to seeing the opposite
 Digitaldude555#5515: yo that pip flip game is insane I just saw it......its insanely good.
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: tbf I found my team trough other mean so I could found other more niche speciality
 birdstone#3073: that's how my team worked as well, we have 1 designated artist 1 designated musician and i was the designated designer and programmer
 Aiminer357#8033: thing is, most people joining are programmers so the server is saturated by programmers (not a bad thing)
 Jasper#7906: The DFAF I mentioned, is Double Fine (developer of Psychonauts (1 & 2), I'd say AA, not AAA) doing something like that. I found it very interesting to follow. They only make prototypes, but they've actually gone ahead with a number of them (and then they've ended up abandoning a number of them while unfinished in early access, but oh well...)
 syelan34#3258: Ok thanks for telling me
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: NO DON'T. You may even be disqualified for that
 akaBl4ck#7384: I had worked with him before, it was me basically because I wasn't very active during the making of it
but hey, jonas called the water of the game nice
*it was for the teamseas jam hosted by polymars & barji*
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: It help if most people of the team have different speciality, we had a guy spending like 80% of his time making music and that turn out so much better then I though
 birdstone#3073: lmao yup i noticed
 Lyfe#8258: Yeah but they're so boring, and the lower budget is lower risk, cuz chances are as long as they space out the releases and have a decent marketing strat they're gonna get their money back anyway for literally every game they make, so why not encourage more interesting games and occasionally you get the next Fallout New Vegas
 Aiminer357#8033: lol most people spend only the week before to find teammates
 syelan34#3258: Yeah I definitely think my game is much worse than it could’ve been just because I have a few features that i didn’t have time for
 Scolon#4218: You can follow the creator
 Julien#2204: I mean yeah, but it's not really a competition. I'm a solo dev and the game is clunky, but I'm happy with the idea so I'm gonna work on it regardless of the ratings
 birdstone#3073: typically if i want to work with someone new i spend a month or two making small projects with them to know how they work
 FryDev#0372: you’d probably have to do several other game jams to find a team that you’re able to work with well
 akaBl4ck#7384: i've only worked with someone once in a game jam and it wasn't very good
 shenalkm#1022: oh thanks
 honiemun#0001: Is there anything similar to a wishlist system on Itch? It'd be nice to have a call to action of sorts after the player finishes a game, to be notified if an update comes out or such
 LOPSTERu#3902: its one of the most rated game so just sort by that
 Digitaldude555#5515: execution will beat a good idea 99/100
 syelan34#3258: I feel like I could’ve added so much more important stuff, but I happened to be visiting family during the jam so I had maybe 5 hours a day to actually do anything, and that was all from staying up until like 1:00
 birdstone#3073: i worked in a team with two people from my school and despite the arguing we pulled off something pretty good i think
 shenalkm#1022: can someone DM me the link - cant seem to find it
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: If you're trying to get to top 100 solo, then maybe big teams undermining that goal, but let's be real: with 6k games chances for you to end up in that 100 aren't that high anyway.
 Digitaldude555#5515: its what sells
 BadPiggy#5202: Depends lol
Sometimes a good idea and decent execution is all you need
 akaBl4ck#7384: i'm quite stressed working as a team
 Lyfe#8258: I wish the big game publishers actually did this to make games, instead of spending 50 million on 1 big game that's an "open world action adventure with stealth and crafting" like every other AAA game, they just give 25 teams 2 million each, and they're bound to get a brilliant game out of it eventually
 FryDev#0372: yeah, not unfair, but admittedly it does feel like solo devs don’t stand much of a chance against coordinated teams
 akaBl4ck#7384: it's good, i got 1.4% and i got web + windows
 BadPiggy#5202: ( oinks in gratitude )
 Kipash#0301: i've played your game ❤️  was fun :) The pig face made me remeber :D
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: I don't see the issue with big teams entering game jams - trying to deliver a bigger game with a bigger team in such a short time is its own unique challenge.
 Aiminer357#8033: it makes sense, theyre a team and they have a lot of experience. cant really blame them for joining again
 Julien#2204: Too late for that. I'm gonna di that next year
 syelan34#3258: Mine is 1%, I don’t know if that’s good or bad but I have a web only game
 BadPiggy#5202: 8 member team lol. Nice
 akaBl4ck#7384: guys mind that your CTR will be low if you don't have a web build
 syelan34#3258: Should I put a link to an updated version of my game in the description? It doesn’t have any major changes just like a couple of visual indicators added and some bugs fixed
 Jasper#7906: I don't really think the result would be all that good. And most teams know that it wouldn't really work. That's why I think that if a developer actually joins, what you usually get is more like the Double Fine Amnesia Fortnite, where a real developer breaks up into groups of people doing jam-like projects
 FryDev#0372: I know, it’s almost frustrating in a way how good they are
 The Handsome  Cat#6115: ok thanks
 BadPiggy#5202: Wait what ? Team Bugulon made a game ?!?
Gimme gaem
 Aiminer357#8033: goddamn i just looked at it and it looks so professional compared to the rest (no offense to you guys)
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: rate other games and leave comments, makes people more likely to check out your game. Also, keep an eye out for people here in chat with "DM me games" in their name, they're usually open to playing games and giving them ratings
 FryDev#0372: Pip Flip Paradise
 Aiminer357#8033: ahh. what game did they make this year?
 Julien#2204: Does Mark have a twitch channel? I've been following the YouTube one for ages and I heard he does streams as well
 FryDev#0372: that was Team Bugulon
 Sir Tetris#1382: yeah you can talk about any submission in the jam (i think)
 Aiminer357#8033: last year there was a really polished game that had a pretty big team compared to the rest of the jam. made mark consider putting a limit to the size
 BlankSlate#8922: I think it's allowed
 FryDev#0372: Team Bugulon joined again, although I’m not sure if you’d count them as a “professional dev team”
 RedTeapot#1960: Oh cool, thanks!
 Weeblings#1759: is it allowed to talk about my favourite game jam games? cuz the one i like has only 14 people rating it. i m new to  GMTK game jam (game jams in general) so idk if just 14 people playing ur game and rating it would be good enough.
 The Handsome  Cat#6115: BRo why me game stuck at 4 rateings ?
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: Blame Epic
 Kaz#4378: Didn't quite get to make a game I want to make for my team so we settled on a janky "rage-inducing" style of platformer
 Kipash#0301: i think folks do that.
 Lyfe#8258: i wonder what would happen if a professional dev team joined this jam, cuz it would be a logistical nightmare but the end product would be insane
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: no my problem is I'm on Linux and Unreal Engine Games don't play nicely with Proton
 Aiminer357#8033: is there a reason unreal engine games are soooo huge?
 Jasper#7906: Look for "ideation", it can be a bit wishy-washy at times, but there's plenty of techniques that can help. The best known technique is of course the good old brainstorm
 Aiminer357#8033: i download a game that was like 400mb
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: not if you don't give them your own games 🙃
 akaBl4ck#7384: If they use unreal engine it will take ages to download on mine xd
 Kipash#0301: From 300 till 1000 the average is 16
 Aiminer357#8033: people do that?
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: I'll play any games, but if they use Unreal Engine, it'll have to wait till I get back to my main PC in a few days
 Sir Tetris#1382: is it allowed to repost your game page in ?
 CadenJO [DM to trade ratings]#2365: does putting DM me your games in your own bio help yourself get more ratings?
 akaBl4ck#7384: ayy I got 15
 DevByMarc#7784: 😏🤘
 Ting#1574: You can send me your game link. I will rated it
 MaryStrawberry#4672: the list didn't appear for me but it did for a friend who didn't participate
that's odd
 birdstone#3073: *gee i wonder where i can find someone with that in their name*
 RedTeapot#1960: Do you know any of the tools or methods?
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: One way of getting some ratings is keeping an eye out for people with "DM me games" in their name
 akaBl4ck#7384: I mean making only a windows build since noone is gonna download it
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: ~8
 MioMilo#1922: Yes, I was a participant and submitted a game along with 5 other teammates
 Lighted#2578: not if it is paid lol
 CadenJO [DM to trade ratings]#2365: how many ratings is the norm rn?
 MaryStrawberry#4672: did you participate in the jam last year?
 Art Man Oil#5039: It was so much better that i worked with a team since it just made it way easier to do everything
 MioMilo#1922: does that really work ? I'll try anyway
 Casper#6361: Yeah that's probably a measure to prevent 20 contributors to be added to spam ratings
 akaBl4ck#7384: I played a really fun but unbalanced tower defence game made with gamemaker
 Jasper#7906: There's some talent involved, in my opinion, but largely, it's a skill that can be trained and enhanced with tools and methods
 THE T VIRUS#2754: Not if you win. They will need it for the YouTube video for sure
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: these games are so good that my laptop has overheated
 MaryStrawberry#4672: makes it more accessible to people buuuuuuut the jam is over and you can't upload stuff rn
 MioMilo#1922: oh I see, last year I wasn't the one who submitted my team's game, that must be why
 CadenJO [DM to trade ratings]#2365: i made a windows build because WebGL is very scary
 Hemera#2002: and co-contributors too, apparently, for us only the submitter didn't have to rate the queue list
 RomketMan#0055: I'm spending my evening after work playing games and leaving comments, also checking out some livestreams of people doing the same
 akaBl4ck#7384: Honestly making a windows build is wasting your time
 Kaz#4378: You can try rating other people's games and comment then hope that they will do the same for you
 Casper#6361: That's only for people who didn't submit a game
 BlankSlate#8922: My ctr is 1.64%
 Art Man Oil#5039: 1.14 😔
 Chazi b#4006: I'm sitting at 0.5% ctr right now myself
 domjanabi#9370: so the rate of interactions when someone sees your game?
 akaBl4ck#7384: So I'm surprised it got 1.4% ctr
 MioMilo#1922: Hey ! Last year, i remember that we had a list of game we had to review before being able to review any game we want. That way every game get some review. This years, I don't have that list, has it been removed ?
If yes, how do I get to bring more visibility to my game so that it can receive some rating ?
 Ian Mykl#4218: 1.23% 😦
Up from 0.9 something yesterday though
 Jasper#7906: click through rate
 BlankSlate#8922: Click through rate
 RedTeapot#1960: Not sure if anyone notices this because the chat moves fast, but do you have any thoughts on coming up with cool ideas? Like, there is a dev (or a team) that is good at consistently coming up with unique game ideas for GMTK (guess who I'm talking about hehe) while still adhering to the theme. Is it pure talent or there's some kind of a method I don't know about?
 Scolon#4218: Average ctr is like 0.5% or something
Anything above 1% is high
 domjanabi#9370: what is a ctr ?
 Casper#6361: Ideally the game teaches the player, but it's really challenging to nail that
 MrBen#0001: idk I have like 2,35
 akaBl4ck#7384: I made my game when I was on vacation in my laptop with a trackpad with mobile data and I didn't have access to Photoshop to make a good one so I just used a screenshot from my game
 Jasper#7906: quite good. 1% is good, 3% is amazing
 Arkeon#9826: uh 19 downloads
 BlankSlate#8922: Luckily people seem to understand my game pretty well since all my buttons have pretty simple functions and are labeled properly
 Art Man Oil#5039: Ok awesome ima redraw it
 Sir Tetris#1382: hmm how good is a 2.3% ctr
 MrBen#0001: yes shot
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: no shot
 Acu1000#5560: yes
 Casper#6361: Yup, just don't accidentally delete game files
 Art Man Oil#5039: Are we allowed to put new thumbnails i think the current one for casino roll is too Bland (?)
 akaBl4ck#7384: I got like 1.1k 7d impressions and 1.41% CTR
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: be happy that you skipped the tutorial. I lost a day on that and people still have no clue how to play
 MrBen#0001: well its my first
 Scolon#4218: It's also important to note that game jam ctrs are going to be inflated
Mine is at 1.60% rn
 Acu1000#5560: how many jams have you participated in
 Casper#6361: Impressions are mostly luck. Good thumbnails can help but it's just up to chance
 RomketMan#0055: Ah same, I didn't have a tutorial either, but tried guiding the player with a super simple first level that "should" explain the button mechanic, only problem is since the button works first time people have been going to level 2 not realising that the dice orientation needs to match the button
 Sir Tetris#1382: the real stat is the ctr: basically the percentage of time people clicked on your game instead of scrolling down
 MrBen#0001: lmao idk 👀
 Art Man Oil#5039: Whats an impression is it just people that saw it
 Lighted#2578: that is really high, good job
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: I'm close to 1k how on earth did you manage 10 times that
 akaBl4ck#7384: Honestly I expected noone to play my game and people that played it would not understand the controls at all
 MrBen#0001: idk what it even mean so yeah
 Sir Tetris#1382: 1959 impressions with 2.3% ctr
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: ty gonna try it
 Acu1000#5560: It's like friend telling you "theres something I have to tell you"
 Art Man Oil#5039: For mine it says 4392 is that good
 Mr.Boda#3589: Several people are typing
 Casper#6361: But the CTR is skewed quite a bit cause it also counts my own visits to the page
 Sheref#0910: Just sent it in  precise dice
 Hobusu#5033: It is, which is why Mark timed that person out for a day
 BlankSlate#8922: Notifications give me such a weird mix of anxiety and excitement
 MrBen#0001: idk it just says it
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: how the hell 10000 seems like a lot
 Acu1000#5560: use 
 Casper#6361: I got about 1500 with 0,74% ctr
 Lighted#2578: is this considered spam
 akaBl4ck#7384: i got 6 😳
 Hobusu#5033: Always fun to hop on the server and see Mark do something like that
 Twelveoclock#2212: Anyone looking for games to try, can dm me to try my game. I promise its a wild ride 😄
 MrBen#0001: wow cool I got 10000 of this
 Sir Tetris#1382: the number of times people saw your game on a link on itch.io, basically tells you how many times people got an opportunity to click on your game
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: Also can you send me your game I would like to try another puzzle game
 BlankSlate#8922: I was the only playtester sadly I was really worried that my game would be really unintuitive since I don't really have a tutorial
 Casper#6361: Amount of time your thumbnail/link showed up somewhere
 Art Man Oil#5039: Ohh ok
 birdstone#3073: idk i get anxious in regards to reviews so i prefer to get fewer more detailed and quality reviews than more but possibly troll reviews
it's a personal thing, i know that shouldn't be too much of an issue but it just stays in the back of my head sometimes
 Mark Brown#6982: You can sing to yourself for a day 🫥
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: good idea I hope it helped
 Beeg scarf#3571: Me when i wake up to one notification
 Digitaldude555#5515: whats a collecton?
 Sheref#0910: I got my whole family playtesting the game lol
 MrBen#0001: btw what r '7d Impressions'?
 RomketMan#0055: Yeah I had my roommate be the playtester, so that any bias on knowing the puzzles was gone. Had to redesign a level because he just couldn't make sense of it
 akaBl4ck#7384: People actually like my game??
 Occelot Dan#3777: Hit me with that link, I'll add it to me list 🤘
 Jasper#7906: Hm... that's a radically different play to rating ratio than what I have. Don't know if that means anything, but it's definitely interesting
 MrBen#0001: what r u tlaking about?
 Art Man Oil#5039: Painful
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: you really need outside perspective for a puzzle game or it's probably not gonna be great level design
 ImNot_Kriss#3652: **MY HEART**
**--AH AH AH AAH, AH AH AH AH AAH, AH AH AH AH AAH AH,  A A A OO A OO OO AA--**
 BlankSlate#8922: What style did you go with?
 Acu1000#5560: silence is absense of sound and dark is absence of light so you cant see/hear them, its more about not seeing/hearing anything
 ImNot_Kriss#3652: **CAN YOU FIX THE BROKEN**
CAN YOU FEEL??
CAN YOU FEEL
 Art Man Oil#5039: I wish i did that 😔
 nucleic#9655: Link? I'll rate it
 Toboter#5206: I too have a bit of an art style.
 ImNot_Kriss#3652: **CAN YOU HEAR THE SILENCE**
CAN YOU SEE THE DARK
 Sheref#0910: It's really hard balancing the hardness of a puzzle game when you're the one making the puzzles
 NalaFala38290#9305: my game is probably one of the smallest
 Casper#6361: Yeah I am already quite high on the karma tab
 Art Man Oil#5039: ours has 341 views and 16 collections
 Acu1000#5560: I went for minimalistic pixel art style so most of my game's art was done before the first hour of the jam passed
 Sir Tetris#1382: my team's game only has 14 ratings :(
 BlankSlate#8922: I went with a 1 bit art style
 Scolon#4218: I think you need to keep playing, my graph is currently spiking, it's going to eclipse yesterday
 MrBen#0001: yeah on my first day during the night I got 16 🦙
 NalaFala38290#9305: 3 collections
 Tapu#9161: The analytics page link you have on top of your game page
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: retro art style is just easier to get a decent result fast enough for the game jam, 3d game rarely have stellar artwork
 Art Man Oil#5039: How do you check those
 Lighted#2578: that is huge
 Casper#6361: I got 8 or something ratings and then it died down. First day has a lot of impact it seems
 Acu1000#5560: How did you get so many
 BlankSlate#8922: From what I can tell people like the simplicity and the retro art style
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Why would you plan that?
 Scolon#4218: I'm at 48 views 30 plays, 20 rates, 2 collections rn
 MrBen#0001: the views graph is a huge spike lol
 Casper#6361: Damn that's a lot
 birdstone#3073: i actually planned to get like 10 ratings each day so i don't get too many but also don;t get too little, getting 52 on the first day disrupted my plan lmao
 Art Man Oil#5039: We had a team to I was able to focus completely on art which was good
 MrBen#0001: well itch says that my game has 486 views and 92 downloads
 Sir Tetris#1382: nvm i thought you were required to rate submissions randomly bc it sorts randomly by default, but the only ones you are required to are the 5 in your queue then you can just sort by popular. still think most people will be rating while sorting randomly
 BlankSlate#8922: A lot of my time was spent balancing my game so that it wasn't too hard or too easy and I think I did ok enough
 Scolon#4218: My plays are starting to pick up, general consensus so far is that people really enjoy the combat/presentation
 Acu1000#5560: My game is got only a few comments but all of them seem to have really liked it, even though the idea is not the most unique out there
 Maxy#9186: Yeah, which is good.
My point just was that people shouldn't be discouraged just because they only have "a few" ratings.
 BlankSlate#8922: I personally like hard games so I see that as a positive
 MrBen#0001: yeah same here 👀 . People love my LIMBO-like style
 BadPiggy#5202: Same lol
Even though some feel it's hard
The game was actually going to be much harder though :linkSmug:
 BlankSlate#8922: I am honestly just happy that people seem to like my game
 MrBen#0001: oh ok
 Scolon#4218: Itch has a lot of different ways to detect what the true rating of a game too though
If you just had like 100 ratings and they were all 5* and no one left any comments etc, they'd be very suspicious about cheating/botting
 Fabianofski#5442: There are just rating spammers in every jam i think in one jam there was someone with a coolness over a 1000 games lol
 MrBen#0001: well I think that (my opinion) my game is visualy one of the best games ngl. I styled the game for LIMBO and it turned out sick
 Maxy#9186: The ratings most likely aren't based on "number of ratings" though, but on how well they are rated.
If you have 16 ratings and all are 5 * or 500 ratings and all are 3*, the 16 ratings one should win obv
 Twelveoclock#2212: I think my game has the potential for top 100, given enough ratings
 Beeg scarf#3571: Yeah
 Lyfe#8258: how do you even do that and actually make it so its even slightly accurate, like sure if you give all the broken games 1 star i guess
 Mr.Boda#3589: i wont win Xd
 Kipash#0301: Busy guy :D
 MrBen#0001: I don't think so
 Beeg scarf#3571: Im talking about a game that won and got into marks video
 Jasper#7906: Mark plays random games on stream
 MrBen#0001: well Mark plays only top 100 games
 Maxy#9186: What do you mean?
 Catralitos#4674: ok cool. hopefulyl I'm lucky and our group makes it on. we could use more ratings
 Beeg scarf#3571: On past years i saw a winner game that only had 16 ratings
 Fabianofski#5442: What i find more interesting about the entries.json file in each jam is the one with the highest coolness amount. In this jam someone already rated 218 games 🤨
 Scolon#4218: Yeah you can't just "submit and forget" you need to play games and do a bit of marketing
People who are getting a ton of ratings right off the back are usually just lucky or already have a big following
 Sir Tetris#1382: people have to rate randomly though unless they know the name of the game they're searching for
 MrBen#0001: well I got 24 ratings but its too little to get into top 100
 Maxy#9186: The amount of ratings really doesn't mean much. There are over 6.000 games, so games will just go under the radar easily.
You could have a really stellar game that no one ever plays because no one just ever found it.
Just make sure you do your part to have actually people play it, and that's it.
 LOPSTERu#3902: well that was the theme
 Mr.Boda#3589: see my post in 
 MrBen#0001: I have one 😏
 Kipash#0301: ❤️
 NalaFala38290#9305: find a game without dice or randomness
 LOPSTERu#3902: heyy i have average thats average
 Digitaldude555#5515: feel good about getting 15 ratings
 Acu1000#5560: I am away from my pc right now so I cannot review people's games 😩 So it'll be pretty hard to get a significant amount of ratings for me
 MrBen#0001: anyone wants to play my game by chance 🥺
 Lyfe#8258: im guessing thats the mean, which it says is 8.4 ratings
 Kipash#0301: those are averages
 LTCat#9725: so median is about 5?
 Kipash#0301: There's some random data 😄 doesn't say much.. just that popular games are popular.

 Lyfe#8258: if you wanna try to load it yourself then the file is here so by all means try
 Mr.Boda#3589:   see my post int it
 BadPiggy#5202: During
 Catralitos#4674: A question about Mark's streams. Are they gonna be during or after the voting period?
 LTCat#9725: it's not that important to get that median so don't waste more time on it :/
 Kipash#0301: VS reports the app's usage to be 44 MB of ram :/
 Lyfe#8258: only 8gb, which sounds like enough considering its a 3mb file, and yet its massively slowed down my computer
 Kipash#0301: How much ram do you have?
 Lyfe#8258: i think you would have to code one yourself to specifically get the median without killing your computer but yeah its possible
 Jasper#7906: Yeah, but you could read one object, save the number you're interested in, discard the object, read the next. Total approximate ram required: one object + one long list of numbers. (The latter could even be written to disk in a separate file if you want to use even less memory.) A parser that can do that is probably tough to work with, but it probably exists.
 Acu1000#5560: ah so thats how
 Casper#6361: Just play some more jam games whenever you feel like it. Currently I am like 3:1 with games rated to ratings received, just takes time
 Digitaldude555#5515: nearly everyone thats commented on my game is someone I rated first
 Lyfe#8258: but if you only care about probing secret data for your own game then yeah sure
 Digitaldude555#5515: just rate some games, leave comments you will get your ratings
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: that's it, just keep it going
 Lyfe#8258: i think if you wanna get the median you would have to read the whole file eventually, in order to get the number of ratings for each
 JIBUS#8140: hey there ! have a dumb question but still a question, how you guys are getting vote ? *i reviewed a lot of game, send it on streams and on this discord, don't know what to do more :/
 Jasper#7906: There's probably json parsers that don't need the whole file in memory to work, and can read the file piecemeal instead. Don't know if it's actually worth the effort, but I bet it's possible
 Scolon#4218: It's still guesswork though
At best you can get a rough idea
 honiemun#0001: yeah id rather remain oblivious until the rating period is over
 LTCat#9725: I mean, if you can do some math works on that json or something
 honiemun#0001: oh wait you can ??
 Acu1000#5560: insanity
 birdstone#3073: you can only see how many you have
 Lyfe#8258: you straight up need like a terabyte of ram to actually parse it without slowing down, and i have downloaded all the ram i can
 Acu1000#5560: wait you can see your ratings? how?
 Scolon#4218: Also I don't think that script would be accurate anyways since we don't know the internal workings of the placement algorithms
 Lyfe#8258: parsing through the data is so slow for me lmao, someone else do it lmaoo
 Casper#6361: Pretty sure you can't actually know your ratings
 Jasper#7906: Yes, yet it would
 Acu1000#5560: Coolness is the rating average
 LTCat#9725: I don't want to know my ratings... until the final result is out.
It's painful to watching it goes up and down until it stopped changing =. =
 NalaFala38290#9305: would a game about ice dice be cooler
 aviv13243546#4030: "Coolness" should be one of the voting subjects
 Scolon#4218: That's probably stuff like cover images, videos, etc
 RedTeapot#1960: Time for someone to fiddle with the correlation things
 Kipash#0301: not sure, perhaps it's the same as "Popular" in SortBy on the submission page
 aviv13243546#4030: 👏🏻
 Lyfe#8258: interestingly, theres a "coolness" attribute that each jam entry has
 Ian Mykl#4218: fair
 Jasper#7906: 😎
 aviv13243546#4030: I Actually really like how I designed my Itch.io page, It turned out really cool!
 Ian Mykl#4218: what's "coolness"? (in relation to the json file)
 Scolon#4218:  indeed
 Lyfe#8258: you just have to parse that and do some maths to determine the median
 Acu1000#5560:  take a look there
 Jasper#7906: 😂
 jakerbaker#4915: i did it was painful
 NalaFala38290#9305: sadly
 aviv13243546#4030: lol
 Digitaldude555#5515: none of us joined
 jakerbaker#4915: did you join the GMTK game jam and if so what games did you guys make?
 LTCat#9725: night here...
 Lyfe#8258: okay i have the entries.json file
be warned, it is extremely slow to load
 Scolon#4218: morning
 Jolly Ask#0856: morning!
 jakerbaker#4915: good morning game devs!
 Kipash#0301: If anyone is interested in ratings of your submissions checkout this script 👍
It can tell you your position and global ratings average.
 Aiminer357#8033: telling streamers who are streaming the jam to play your game also helps
 THE T VIRUS#2754: Not sure who it was, but thanks for the nickname tip
 RomketMan#0055: That was it!
 Casper#6361: It's not obligatory of course but it only works if there also people playing games from the channel
 THE T VIRUS#2754: Just doing a quick test to see if my nickname is okay
 Delphine Noel#1196: Monthly Income: $330 Million + not billion
 Casper#6361: Also if you use  make sure to rate one or two from the channel in return
 Spico#6316: you cant spam theres a 6 hour cooldown
 Delphine Noel#1196: I don't want to spam
 RomketMan#0055: The easiest way to remember average vs median is with the joke "bill Gates walks into a coffee shop and the average salary in the room jumps to 1 billion+"
This doesn't happen with median
 Aiminer357#8033: my timezones dont line up with the majority here so most of the reviews happen when i sleep
 Acu1000#5560: Make a good use of 
 Delphine Noel#1196: I already did that
 Lyfe#8258: Oh right, there's an entries.json file with that data somewhere lemme try find it
 snuffysam#2767: yeah in english it's kind of ambiguous. some people say "average" when they mean "mean", other people say "average" and just mean "central tendency" in general
 Casper#6361: I believe that in previous years the median was around 20 each time
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: dude, stop
 Aiminer357#8033: you can do that??
 qxt2019#6669: el gato por favore
 Ian Mykl#4218: I know how you in general find it, but I don't know for the jam unless you want to scroll through a heck of a list of games to find the middle
 NalaFala38290#9305: I'm going to make my game thumbnail a GIF
 LTCat#9725: sit around and wait!
 Ber#3410: Changed nickname again
 q1#3172: typical game devs cant do math
 Casper#6361: Yeah there's just a 6 hour delay in between
 Acu1000#5560: Interesting cover image and screenshots
 Delphine Noel#1196: Ah I see
 Ber#3410: EL GATO ‼‼
 Danny Dan Dan#6699: Just wondering, is it okay if we post our games multiple times in the  channel? I posted it yesterday during the wave of people submitting but I wouldn't mind getting some more eyes on it.
 Lyfe#8258: Sort the numbers and pick the middle one
 Jolly Ask#0856: classic math discourse in the game jam discord
 Acu1000#5560: oh well, in my native language median is not called average
 AlpalcaLad#2549: It's really nice being a maths person and watching the chaos unfold over different averaging methods
 NalaFala38290#9305: comment on other's games
 Ber#3410: Put it as your nickname or comment on stuff
 qxt2019#6669: im already making a update for my game so its bug free after the voting ends and ill add some more content
 Delphine Noel#1196: Is there anything I'm supposed to do, to promote my game? or do I just sit around and wait
 Ian Mykl#4218: which is great I just don't know you you know what the median is. The mean is super easy to determine though. ~~and then there's the mode which nobody cares about~~
 Jasper#7906: median is not mean. Median and mean are both averages (but mean is the most commonly used average)
 SleepyJeff#9492: I feel like im in my statistics class 😂
 Jolly Ask#0856: Mischief and hijinks
 LTCat#9725: median is about 7~8 now
 Acu1000#5560: Does anyone know what the median of ratings is right now?
 MK#2034: 13 ratings so far, but I'm just getting started on the marketing.
 Acu1000#5560: Median is not average
 Ber#3410: 16 ratings is good for a breakout game right?
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Sorry, thats what i meant
 NalaFala38290#9305: the mean is currently around 8
 Lyfe#8258: The reason theyre using median in this case is because some games have loads of ratings so it would skew the mean to make it look like the average person has way more ratings than they actually do
 Twelveoclock#2212: 1 ,2, 5, 7, 8 ->  median is 5, mean is (1+2+5+7+8) / 5
 QuantumMeme#1665: That moment when your game has only 2 ratings
 NalaFala38290#9305: no that's the mean
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Median:
Average number of rating across all games
Number of ratings divided by number of submissions
 Ber#3410: 🎲 🏐 🧱
DiceOut described in emojis
 Ian Mykl#4218: median is the value in the middle of all values, which could be considered the "average"
The mean is the sum of all options divided by the number of options, which is what most people think when they say "average"
 honiemun#0001: That sounds like a fun idea actually
 Lyfe#8258: Tbf it is a type of average
 q1#3172: i was wrong :)
 Leevi2000#1089: I think there is a great way to gain ratings:
Start a twitch stream and rate others games, leave a link to your game so the viewers can also play yours.
 NalaFala38290#9305: median is the middle number when the numbers are all sorted
 Spico#6316: time to dice it out
 Toboter#5206: I should make a script to calculate the current median...
 q1#3172: average i think
 SeanSS#0892: Oh God the among us
 5fm#0001: that would be very sus *sorry*
 Ber#3410: Im too stupid to know what median means
 Hemera#2002: nope XD
 Twelveoclock#2212: where can we see the median?
 NalaFala38290#9305: my game name would better fit a dating sim
 Ian Mykl#4218: how are you determining the median btw?
 honiemun#0001: did you make the one with the among us in it
 Hemera#2002: I think our team made the only dating sim, or at least I have not seen any other yet
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Why is everyone crying about their number of ratings when it's above the median
 Ber#3410: I put my game in 
 nizbel#9979: My feedback mostly revolves on a loud as heck sound effect, I added a note to the description warning about it but not sure if it’s helpful
 SeanSS#0892: Ic
 Acu1000#5560: I only have 13 ratings so far 😩
 Toboter#5206: If you are below the median, you get a score detraction.
 pibolib#2222: yeah, i noticed that
i'm kinda surprised that's the idea that everyone gravitated to immediately
 Ber#3410: 16 RATINGS LESS GOOO
 JoaoCupido#0225: It's a nostalgic flash game about turning ur block around in a tile
 Jasper#7906: To be fair, at the time it was really just a side project made by a uni professor. It would probably never even have gotten things like web builds if that hadn't changed
 Ian Mykl#4218: I'm what I'd consider a very comfortable 16 ratings
More importantly  is that I've only gotten positive feedback in the comments, which feels really good
 AlpalcaLad#2549: whichever of you made the gambler is a video game genius
 Hawkshaw#1364: Why 25?
 SeanSS#0892: Whuts bloxorz?
 JoaoCupido#0225: There's alot of "Bloxorz type-of" games in this game jam. I'm glad I scraped this idea.
 Hemera#2002: same 🤝
 SeanSS#0892: Aw dang sounds like a bummer
 Micomi#2488: I want to rate as many as I can manage while also giving them the proper time to leave an actual review. I'll do my best 	(๑˃ᴗ˂)ﻭ
 Cheese#8160: Compliment sandwich :D
 dhafo#4640: oh god i have like 4 dms rn 😭 but i will for sure rn
 Ian Mykl#4218: Gotta get that "sandwich-style" concrit strategy going
 Victor Seibert#6634: send me your game!
 Jasper#7906: The limitations were pretty reasonable all the way back in GM5 (earlier than that it was completely free, and only new non-essential features got restricted). It was in the versions after that the limitations got restrictive, with it getting limited to what platforms you could build and whatnot
 dardasaba#9759: My game currently has 50 ratings, way more than I expected to get
 nizbel#9979: Yup, I always compliment first then point bugs or improvements
 sbubby#4885: i always try to add comments with positives/negatives for every rating i do
it takes way too long but i think it's better than just leaving a rating
 Micomi#2488: Holy heck thats SO many haha. Mines at 9 so far
 Ber#3410: 😭 i am jelous
 JJfriends#3686: Mine is almost at 20
 dhafo#4640: i am currently at 6 ratings so 20 sounds awesome lol
 R2D2Vader#0693: There is an easy way which is activating the mid tier which has web exports 😭
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Mine is super close to beating the 6 ratings mark
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Damn, already! We were only at 50 this morning. Holy hell.
 JJfriends#3686: What
 Lyfe#8258: My game is so close to breaching the 300 ratings mark
 Jolly Ask#0856: big week for fans of dice
 Kritical#4329: I am at 4 so u guys are doing fine
 Spico#6316: nice
 din#1788: some guy has 500 idk how lol
 Lyfe#8258: Lmao my laptop is so hot rn I'm holding it in front of a fan, but I've now rated 35 games so Its a decent place to stop for now
 JJfriends#3686: Alr
 SeanSS#0892: 👍
 Scolon#4218: I'm at 18 ratings right now, I had 105 ratings by the end of last jam I particpated in
That said, on my analytics the plays spiked this morning so I might  get a lot of ratings today
 Ber#3410: Idk my friend get it off of craiyon
 Ian Mykl#4218: 20 is above the mean (8) by a good bit
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: send it in the review my game channel, I'll look at it
 Maxy#9186: Ah, so I guess you still need to buy a license for web then
 Toboter#5206: As long as you beat ~25 by Sunday, you'll be fine.
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: 7 rating and 3 comment tho the comment aren't really constructive
 SeanSS#0892: Yeah but it had some very restrictive limitations I remember
 Spico#6316: why do i keep seeing your pfp as that nerd 3d emoji thing but as a duck
 Ber#3410: Put gamename as server nickname
 BlankSlate#8922: 20 is already really good I got 14 so far
 Toboter#5206: Not really.
 Ian Mykl#4218: I just sort by random and pick anything with an intriguing cover
 Spico#6316: then how does lower than 20 do
 Jasper#7906: My memory is a bit foggy, but I remember there being a free version even in the GM5 days
 Chief#5673: meu jogo foi avaliado só 9 vezes hahaha, send me your game bro
 Ber#3410: I did 😎 made it better
 JJfriends#3686: I thought this thing was balanced in the amount of ratings I get
 din#1788: damn i have 20 but only 3 comments
in most other jams ive done basically everyone who rates also comments 😐
 Toboter#5206: 20 is completely normal.
 dhafo#4640: anyone have the issue of not knowing wtf to play lol endless dice games
 Victor Seibert#6634: i got only 5 in my game ;-;
 SeanSS#0892: Ahhh so no compiling to windows or webgl?
 nizbel#9979: You mean the cover image?
 JJfriends#3686: I got 20 ratings I need moreeee
 THE T VIRUS#2754: Free unless you want to compile for a platform other than the Opera GX game thing
 Victor Seibert#6634: i hate 52, 1 comment 😐
 Twelveoclock#2212: I might go for a gif thumbnail. Didnt even know i  can make a GIF one
 Maxy#9186: It's free unless you want to sell it or something, yeah
 Chief#5673: I have the feeling that karma is very much related to the amount of comments
 SeanSS#0892: Wait game maker is free now?
 Relis#1309: i have 4 ratings and 2 comments. Tbh it's more than i expected lol
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: If y'all want more people to DM you games, change your nickname for this server so you can advertise it better/passively.
 THE T VIRUS#2754: For a thumbnail, I highly recommend a GIF instead of a static image. My game has been 36th in most popular since voting started. I think that's all thanks to the thumbnail being a GIF
 Ber#3410: Thats people who are brainless and just take the themes name insteadnof thinking of a good name
 Victor Seibert#6634: Hey dicers, does anyone know how this popularity and karma system works?
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: 6200 game and 50k  rating the median is about 8
 Shimp#0064: Have you guys seen dark rouls? Visuals are so good
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: really? I saw at least 15 different "roll or die"s
 Ber#3410: My game should have 0 because i made it in a few hours but for somereason it has over 10
 Hemera#2002: we have 9 ratings atm
 5fm#0001: I need to change the thumbnail as well
 Twelveoclock#2212: I updated my thumbnail to hopefully attract more viewers. fingers crossed
 din#1788: how many ratings "should" you have rn ?
 Ber#3410: Havent seen any similliar names on the submissions page
 dhafo#4640: ayo i'll take u guys at ur offers lol
 DevByMarc#7784: Dice out still the best nickname here!
 TheTransHero#6203: You can dm me your games and I'll be sure to rate them
 RGBCube#8833: anyways gtg lol
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: either that or something with death
 Ber#3410: /nickname (gamename)
 Spico#6316: i found one thats you trying to descend a tower of some sort and you click to launch yourself towards that direction
 RGBCube#8833: oh I see what you mean by nickname lemme do that lol
 dhafo#4640: ROLL DICE
 Leevi2000#1089: Yes, one where you have to aim to direction and try to get higher and higher. It was frustrating to fall back down. I can send the link to you if you want to
 Chowdog 宗翰#0135: Hey if you have less than 10 ratings I'm happy to help
 Spico#6316: well i see one right here
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: idk I don't think the name will help this time. Most games have the same/similar names
 dhafo#4640: i found one where that is a possible thing but like it's a random shell in ur shotgun
 Zoro5168#0115: Question,anyone found pants are for losers games
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: It's relative to how many ratings you've gotten yourself
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: keep an eye out for people here with (DM me your game) in their username, they'll rate it
 nakst#1416: Is there a minimum number of reviews your game needs to get?
 Maxy#9186: On the topic of web versions, is there an easy way to do that with game maker?
Back when game maker was still paid I remember you having to buy an actual license for it, but now that it's free, all I saw was "create executable", which gave me a windows executable
 Ber#3410: Put your game name as your nickname in this server it works for me
 Spico#6316: my music doesnt loop :pain:
 Shimp#0064: Question, anyone found shoot to move games?
 RGBCube#8833: not to mention the fact that audio is completely borked when I tested my game on the web builder
I guess love2d games aren't really compatible with web
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Thanks for the tip
 Spico#6316: i have reviewed around 21 games so far, idk how up thatll take me in karma sort but
 Aurélien#3461: i got 2
 Leevi2000#1089: Web version brings much more players
 din#1788: how??
 Relis#1309: same, but oh well. lesson for the next jam
 Spico#6316: i really should have made a web version
 Ber#3410: Comment on games or put your game  name as your nickname
 RGBCube#8833: I have 5
I need to rate more games to get more people to rate mine
also it'd help if I were able to make a web build but eh
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: It means that the game left him speechless
 NalaFala38290#9305: 12
 Ting#1574: I only got 7
 Spico#6316: 10
:(
idk how to drive in attraction
 Jasper#7906: I did. DiceBattler was even the title I used at the time ^^
 Toboter#5206: For the same reason we have valleys. If there is small hole, more stuff flows into it, makes hole bigger, makes more stuff flow in etc.
 RGBCube#8833: I don't have the ability to rate any games at the moment
unless they have an android build
but I'm not gonna be able to play any games for 4 hours so I still can't rate any
 JJfriends#3686: Gg not winning I only got 20 ratings
 Occelot Dan#3777: Did you create a dice battler? I think I played an early build, if I'm thinking of the same game it was a ton of fun!
I'd love to check out the final submission if ya wanna kick me a link 🤘
 ESC#8775: Tmw when you start rating games  and go "ah sh*t"
 Julien#2204: Snowball
 Fusoy#6101: Being the most rated bring even more ratings
 sbubby#4885: people just couldn't resist it
i don't really think anything above like 100 ratings after a day is completely natural
 Leonardo Da Vinci#4456: 🤦 I am so stoopid. I've even mentioned it before. Me big dum dum 🗿🗿
 Ian Mykl#4218: you can also click the "Rate for GMTK Game Jam 2022" banner on your game to see them
 Jasper#7906: I had some good feedback on early builds, and was able to incorporate a number of suggestions. Some of it I was aware of needing to do, but it got reprioritized and other things were minor, but not on my radar at all
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: Aha! Thx a lot
 krisis in a jar#0904: Send it in my DMs, nvm found it
 nibbbble#2399: cant link here but you can check out my itch.io page in my discord bio, latest game
 Ian Mykl#4218: yea, that tab shows ratings on the game page, not for the jam.
You need to view the jam page to see how many ratings you have
 5fm#0001: the greatest game on the planet is obviously the best game.
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: then where do i find them
 BadPiggy#5202: Looks like it's natural lol
 krisis in a jar#0904: Send me yo game, i got interested
 Lascif#0184: Ratings are not jam ratings.
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: are the ratings shown correctly in the analytics tab? Because I have 36 plays and no ratings
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: the click to view ratio feel so bad to see 😦
 Leonardo Da Vinci#4456: But what's with "the greatest game on the planet" is this shitpost "naturally aspirated" or did someone "turbo" it to the top
 krisis in a jar#0904: it's /s guys!
 nibbbble#2399: hopefully it doesnt actually skew the thing because i want to see more accurate results lol
...unless you guys can rate it 1/5 on everything too
 SlamBamActionman#7160: (just kidding just kidding)
 Occelot Dan#3777: Okay but that is the sweetest thing I've heard all day lol
 krisis in a jar#0904: Lol
 Toboter#5206: I mean, 19 out of 20 desktops are Windows.
 nibbbble#2399: my mom made an itch.io account just to rate me 5/5 on everything 😵‍💫
shes too ecstatic about this
 SaadTheGlad#9716: I completely forgot you could make the cover image a gif
 krisis in a jar#0904: Only 1 person downloaded the Linux version of my game so far and 25 downloaded the Windows one, i wonder why...
 dhafo#4640: i think i need to make a way better gif lol
 Ian Mykl#4218: the mean number of ratings should be about 8, so if you have that many you're doing okay
 Shimp#0064: Rate me lol
 honiemun#0001: GIFs are super powerful, true!
 sbubby#4885: it's actually the best to be just above the median if you want to win though
 dhafo#4640: i ran out of people to rate that i know i think
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: once every 6hours
 BadPiggy#5202: Or just make a gif of the game.
GIFs work wonders in ways that static thumbnails don't
 Jasper#7906: once every 6 hours
 Scolon#4218: We're only allowed to post in  once right
 syelan34#3258: The thing I wanted to change was to add a visual indicator of where the player will end up if you move. I did have a couple of issues as well but mostly isn’t a problem
 sbubby#4885: I don't know about roll'n'skate but from what I know from past jams 3D games almost always tend to have 2-3x more ratings than the median, especially if they take off
 Leonardo Da Vinci#4456: Oh how the algorithm works in mysterious ways, not known to the mortal man 🗿
 honiemun#0001: Mine too... I need to draw a better one once I'm back home
 StormCodes#9924: Always have a web build if possible, else you will end up with way less reviews than desired
 RGBCube#8833: my game thumbnail might not have been enough, because it has 2k impressions but only 30 views
 NalaFala38290#9305: my game thumbnail is just the title
 JQ2#4402: Yeah! Get in there and play other people's games!
 Penguinmanereikel#3708: Frickin hell
 honiemun#0001: Comment and rate other people's games, and make sure the page and the game thumbnail is eye-catching! (Posting on social media and  can also help, but that's more of a mixed bag.)
 Lascif#0184: From what I can gather you don't exactly need a lot of ratings to win. Just have around the median and for them to be all high scores. The more ratings the more diluted your score becomes and harder to get a better rating.
 krisis in a jar#0904: I'm at 19 ratings
 RGBCube#8833: that's still more than me (5)
 dhafo#4640: if u look at last year's results, one person won with 18 ratings lol and most had like 40ish? iirc
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: just comment on other people's games, they'll do the same for you
 Spico#6316: i have been doing that i only have 10 :pain:
 krisis in a jar#0904: Rating others people's games
 Toboter#5206: Commenting, a snazzy thumbnail, and luck.
 BadPiggy#5202: If you get over 300+ ratings, it just means you got lucky / your some famous peep / you submitted at the right time lol
Or you made an actually good game lol
 Penguinmanereikel#3708: I don’t like being called out. It was just an easy idea at the moment.
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: How thematic
 Jasper#7906: Yeah, at around 10 minutes before the deadline, I found a bug in my submitted build. And since then, I've found four more. They're all just minor (mostly visual) issues, but I definitely want to fix them...
 Twelveoclock#2212: How did you guys get that many ratings? Just commenting? I am still stuck at 8 ratings
 Toboter#5206: Random is the standard filter.
 Casper#6361: Did Itch change is such that karma is no longer the standard filter?
 Leonardo Da Vinci#4456: I thought it was a similar case as with Dani on Brackeys Jam a couple of years back
 krisis in a jar#0904: I have rated 39 games so far, wb yall?
 Toboter#5206: In the first few Jams that was actually possible.
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: People worry about their game being similar to someone else's.
I've decided to proceed with the first idea that came up, even if others have already shared their progress on very similar games.
¯\__/¯
 syelan34#3258: Same, I just wish we could update small stuff with the game because every comment mentions this one thing that would be super helpful and really improve the game, and I have that version already made.
 dhafo#4640: it's just a snowball effect, those games dont necessarily even win
 Jasper#7906: (alright, alright, that just takes you to the same page, but it does fit the description: it's a button and its text is "View random submission")
 StormCodes#9924: I just used a die based mini game with a basic crit on 6 rule. I didn't get to attack patterns in time to make it a mini rpg like planned though
 dhafo#4640: i didnt think i was creative but i just thought it was good that i had an entire working game in my head before i even started working on it so i went with it
 RGBCube#8833: there was an issue in my game's tutorial
if it weren't for itch.io crashing, it probably would've never been fixed
making good things out of bad things haha
 Leonardo Da Vinci#4456: Is there a secret recipe for gaining 500 ratings like Roll'n'skate other than making a good game? Why is the discrepancy so big?
 ESC#8775: I am going a compile a list of all the games with that idea
 GuyWithTime#7852: My game has 12 ratings so far and Im pretty happy with that
 syelan34#3258: Probably 4 or 5
 Triggered#6897: "Unique" is a lie
 Michel#2879: indeed i thought my game will be very repeatitive and it turned out to be unique
my game is about everything turning into dices
 dhafo#4640: tbf my game uses the face thing to create words like "DIS" and "ABLE" for example on the faces...so NOT EXACTLY THE SAME THING GUYS
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: the randomizer also hides games you've already rated
 Jasper#7906: aside from the other options people have said, yes, bottom left on the submissions page
 ESC#8775: My game was exactly that idea
And I thought I was so creative and original for thinking of that idea 😭
 VanCastar#5425: Rated 50 games so far and our game got 27 reviews...
Trying to rate as much as possible, but the 6.2k is way too much for 5 days 😄
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: How do you know?
 Michel#2879: they're everywhere
I think eventually one of them will only win cus Mark doesn't like repeatitive ideas
 dhafo#4640: sounds like mine but u have to roll around multiple into each other 😭
 Lascif#0184: Very nice, I'm at 25 rated. Hopefully will get more rated after I finish work
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: I've seen 4 of those out of about 20
 Casper#6361: I'm at 29 ratings now. Just did a 4 hour stint of around 20 games
 Spico#6316: i am rocking it at 20
 Ian Mykl#4218: like 5 or more (out of ~30 I've played)
 dhafo#4640: dang i've only rated 7 so far, takes me forever haha
 SeanSS#0892: Ooo nice
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: which is completely fair, at least we only needed to optimized math equation so it was doable
 Spico#6316: it was 35k this morning god damn
 ESC#8775: Guys, just want to know, how many games have you played where it is a puzzle game where you have to roll a dice around to align a face with a square?
 Michel#2879: sort by random
 BlankSlate#8922: You can sort submissions randomly
 Merus#7019: there is a random queue on itch
 SeanSS#0892: Is there a take me to a random submission button?
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: I knew my game is optimized fine when I launched it outside of the editor and things ran at trice the speed. I forgot to account for the milliseconds delta between ticks.
 Spico#6316: 50k ratings
 N8#2718: i wanted to optimize/add performance settings to me game but no time
 Merus#7019: a good way to get itch.io to put more eyes on your game is to review lots of other games!
 BlankSlate#8922: Go to submissions and in filter submissions you should see a "Haven't rated" and "Have rated"
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: it happened in our team where our game was running perfectly fine but the guy who was testing it was on one of the best gpu he coul buy, we realised we needed optimization when it start lagging after about 500 entity on screen on a laptop
 Merus#7019: not in this channel, please: 
 SeanSS#0892: 
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: And this is why I test my games on my weak surface go with its Pentium CPU
 Lascif#0184: How do you find out how many games you've rated?
 honiemun#0001: Scolon's game is an absolute banger
 SeanSS#0892: aaaa I coulda asked some of my friends who played dnd
 Koolento#6688: 40 😎  i think i've had enough for today, my goal is 100 by the end of voting
 Scolon#4218: Yeah sure, gimme a sec
 ALittleRandomDude23#5867: 27
 Jasper#7906: Probably just someone running a top of the line GPU that saw it running well and didn't realize that that was only because of the good gpu
 BlankSlate#8922: It's always the ones that look super simple that can somehow make my pc cry
 Ian Mykl#4218: I am very glad I went with my second idea instead of my third, which was a puzzle game where you roll dice and try to get specific sides faceup. Turns out a lor of people had that idea lol
 Occelot Dan#3777: Oh hey! I saw some of your progress during the jam and your game looked really cool! Would you mind to DM me a link to your submission?
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I asked for a good amount of consultation from some of the devs on my team who played it. Lol.
 Digitaldude555#5515: something is running in the update function
 RGBCube#8833: the worst part about that
my computer has Ryzen 5 and Rx 560, it should be able to handle it, idk what's wrong
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: there is a couple of game that didn't get optimised at all for weaker computer it seem
 Occelot Dan#3777: I rated a few early submissions yesterday morning, but I'm building a list of games I wanna play on my breaks today
 RGBCube#8833: there's one web game that lags so horribly that I can't even play it lol
and it looks cool but has NO native builds for ANY platform other than webgl
 Scolon#4218: Alright and I should get back to rating
 Hemera#2002: 10, bc I'm technically still at work
 honiemun#0001: I've rated everyone who's rated mine (about 6). I'd definitely love to go and rate random picks once I'm out of work though!
 SeanSS#0892: Fuck I realized I could have made a dungeons and dragons type of game
But Ive never played dnd before so idk if I could have made it
 Digitaldude555#5515: I spent like half an hour on an idle game
 RGBCube#8833: I don't think I've rated any lmfao
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: can you send it to me too
 NalaFala38290#9305: I rated 18
 Chazi b#4006: I've only rated 3 because sleeeep
 nizbel#9979: 10 so far, I try to take notes and i feel guilty for closing a game quickly, even if it bores me
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: can we start calling them James?
 BlankSlate#8922: Can you send me that rpg sounds interesting
 SeanSS#0892: Only one so far, today is my rest day tommorrow is my rating day
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I've rated 0. I'm gonna start tomorrow.
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: 14
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: 20 roughly. But I've lost like 1 hour playing through an rpg i found in the submissions
 BlankSlate#8922: 23
 Ian Mykl#4218: 28 aparently, which is more than I thought lol. Jam games go by pretty fast
 Aurélien#3461: i don't know, i take break between ten game
 SeanSS#0892: *and that game turned out to be cyberpunk 2077*
 theChief#0001: that, and the quality of the team lead!
 GuyWithTime#7852: How many games have y'all rated so far?
 SeanSS#0892: I mean they are already kinda getting blasted by guys in their basement as is lol
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: if I found a team of people i'd love to do that
 Ian Mykl#4218: depending on how good they are at working together from the start
 Jasper#7906: EXTRA, EXTRA: AAA Game studio got through their first meeting by the end of the game jam. Their official statement is that their game will release in 3-5 years.
 GAmeDOS#1097: Very doable honestly with judicious use of placeholder assets
 nizbel#9979: Sounds like a friendship destroyer
 Scolon#4218: What's up guys
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: To get outperformed by a guy in his basement.
 Digitaldude555#5515: new jam idea 3 day jam each day only one person works on it then he passes it to the next guy
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: I mean there is a few triple aaa dev in the jam but probably no studio
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: imagine the chaos
 theChief#0001: no, making a game with a large team in such a short period of time is MUCH harder than doing it solo 😛
 Triggered#6897: Rumors has it that rockstar will make gta6 in 2 days in next GMTK
 GAmeDOS#1097: They start the first pitch presentation right as the jam ends
 Chazi b#4006: Only one game submitted that all 20k people in the jam worked on
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: next year it can be even bigger
 SeanSS#0892: BREAKING NEWS: A whole AAA game studio joins next years jam
 BlankSlate#8922: Now hear me out how about a 7.753 billion person team
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: Good, time to start collecting favours
 Digitaldude555#5515: should there be a limit?
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: that feels like cheating tho
 Chazi b#4006: There isn't
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: 20 000 person team?
 BlankSlate#8922: Depends on the comment if the comment is asking a question, providing feedback, or goes in depth on their thoughts I like to respond that way I can make it clear that I am open to feedback instead of just ignoring
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: Anyone know if there's a team size limit? I might have a crazy plan for next year
 Twelveoclock#2212: You can send to me your games to play in DM as well
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: i personally do
 Chowdog 宗翰#0135: I played all in my queue so you guys can keep sending those juicy links
 BadPiggy#5202: True lol. That's the easiest thing you can do XD
Though having a bar which fills up as a player attacks and checking that value and deciding whether an should block also works well
 Jasper#7906: Of course! Everybody knows you find gamer [boy/girl/enby]friends at the board game table, which is also where the dice are
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: but really now, why has no one thought of a dating sim where you date dice
 Twelveoclock#2212: Yeah i know about the leaderboard game. This guy was actually the first one to try my game
 BlankSlate#8922: I have 7 rn
 Spico#6316: found a half a gb game if that counts, it was very klunky and didnt quite function
 LOPSTERu#3902: Should I reply to the comments for my game?
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: Also saw a game where someone made an online leaderboard which was quite surprising, even if I didn't really like the game
 Aurélien#3461: ouch good thing i don't have that kind of issue in my game, except with the score who stay to zero, even if you have kill six gladiators whit a giant dice
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: you render me speechless
 BlankSlate#8922: Probably this one honestly since all my previous games were all insanely simple
 Spico#6316: damn you guys dont?
 Digitaldude555#5515: here is how you cheez it, every time an ai gets hit it will randomly throw a block that counters where the player hit if punch high block if kick low block, cause player will stick to what works. Then the player is amazed this opponent read his move.
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: I have 5 on my list currently
 oa#7680: bitsy is cool, and I do love what it's done for poetry. in agreement with you there
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: obviously. You hear dice you think of dating sims
 Spico#6316: add in mi n e!
 Triggered#6897: If it helps there is a rick roll game
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: I wonder, what's the biggest game anyone's submitted to the jam (in terms of scope, not file size)
 BlankSlate#8922: I have so many games I need to play queued up rn
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: I'm not the dev of that game, I just founded it funny that for some reason someone thought it was a good idea
 Koolento#6688: yep except for a small hole, but the movement speed is too small
 Spico#6316: thats some next level pushing it :ded:
oh wait nvm
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: no way
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: That reminds me, I need to work on my visual novel engine
 BlankSlate#8922: I demand you send me this right now
 BadPiggy#5202: Sus
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: Where did you get that stat from?
 ThatIsANoNoWord#5311: excuse me? Did I just get a stroke?
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: I didn't expect an among us visual novel this game jam
 Aurélien#3461: thanks 🙂
 BlankSlate#8922: It's kinda messed up that people could just hoard domain names like this and just hold them hostage until someone pays up
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: Wait, I only now understood what you've meant.
I read it as "5% of games with the word "dice" on itch.io belong to the GMTKJam"
While it was "thanks to GMTKJam, 5% of _all_ games on itch.io have the word "dice" in its title"
 Nabla#2837: buy it and direct it to your game to flex
 BlankSlate#8922: Idk $100 000 seems like a bit much
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: We should buy it and make it redirect to the Jam
 BadPiggy#5202: ( TAKE ALL THIS WITH A GRAIN OF SALT BECAUSE I SUCK AT GAMEDEV )
In a fighting game you have a variety of attacks and movesets in different directions, all of which can be blocked countered etc. and you need your enemy AI to be able to block / counter / get hit appropriately in a way that's fun
While in a beat-em-up AI, your normal enemy doesn't really need to have so many things to keep track of. It mostly just needs to know the distance to the player and whether it should move in or not / whether player is already engaging with an enemy etc.
Depending on the enemy, it can also counter air attacks, but that's it usually.
 Jasper#7906: costs only $100,000 😎
 Spico#6316: no clue but i could definitely use a slice of it
 Aurélien#3461: my game IA realise the only way to win again theirs developers overlord, is to form a union and organise a strike
 BlankSlate#8922: Looked it up the domain is for sale
 ThatIsANoNoWord#5311: How do some people already have so much ratings
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: This is probably already a thing, you know what io game makers are like
 SleepyJeff#9492: I just open my last game and delete all the assets as a framework 😂 so I dont need to reset URP and everything in a new one
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: I will probably not reuse that code knowing that some of the event management is really really bad
 BlankSlate#8922: Dice.io
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: Jep, itch is invaded by dice now
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: 5%? The community is that big?
 BlankSlate#8922: One day game ai will realise that it can't technically lose if it bricks your entire system
 domjanabi#9370: only 5 lol
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: A surprisingly small amount.
 Jasper#7906: I should have said 'once each turn'. I'm not letting the AI get off that easily 😛
 Digitaldude555#5515: this jam is responsible for 5% of all games on itchio having dice or roll in the title.
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: I would have made mine before the Jam, but I didn't realise the Jam had started until it was running. Although I'll probably take what I wrote for this Jam and turn it into a reusable codebase
 krisis in a jar#0904: I like doing everything from the ground up lol
 Aurélien#3461: what kind of attack ? a beam of light that invade the entire scene ?
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: fuck, didn't realise that
 domjanabi#9370: tbh i think anyone who wants to make games using a framework should make their own framework that suits their own needs. if you make it yourself, you know it in and out
 Aurélien#3461: spoiler
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: Next time make a framework before the Jam to save time.
> Yes! You can use pre-existing code, libraries, and functions. But we ask that you don’t write code specifically for this jam, ahead of time.
 Triggered#6897: Lol
 RomketMan#0055: The ai realised that the smart way to win the game is to stop playing 🤣
 Aurélien#3461: how ? can you argument on this ? i'm studding Game Design to pass my master.
 Koolento#6688: it was descent although one attack of the boss was basically impossible to dodge :D
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: it was fun doing the jam as more of a coding challenge and less as a game design one
 Jasper#7906: Mine too. Like, it's a dice rolling game, and the AI technically has the same options as you, but uses none of them and just rolls their dice once and leaves it at that...
 krisis in a jar#0904: Those are the hurdles of not using a engine
 Aurélien#3461: please tell me the game was fun
 domjanabi#9370: based gmtk octillionaire grindset
 domjanabi#9370: lmao
 BlankSlate#8922: My game has turn based combat and my "ai" is just a glorified random number generator lol helps that they have only 1 attack
 BadPiggy#5202: Aye of course, just that I find beat-em-up enemy AI easier than that of a fighting game AI XD
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: No, I think that's mine
 krisis in a jar#0904: i learned this jam that python in general is bad
 Galactum#6235: my goal, optimistically, is top 1k, but I'd be happy if i got in the top like 50-70%
 Jasper#7906: Or just go single-player, and play against an AI opponent. That's how the genre got (most of) its start in arcade machines after all. Makes balancing much easier too
 q1#3172: could be possible if you have a really good mmo framework set up
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: I learned this game jam that using pygame was a bad idea, decent result but a lot of wasted time
 birdstone#3073: i don't know lol, seriously cool though
 BlankSlate#8922: Only when the rating period is over
 SeanSS#0892: wtf how and why
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: Can you view the rating of your own game?
 Digitaldude555#5515: I time travelled
 BadPiggy#5202: Exactly why I make beat-em-ups lol. More fun to play with as well
 q1#3172: is this a premonition o_o
 birdstone#3073: It's called casino conquest by vedal and tomyomy
 Digitaldude555#5515: My game will rank 4873rd in presentation
 SeanSS#0892: Ye ig, but you cant be sure that all people who rate your games has a friend on standby willing to play it with you
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: I mean yes you created the lack of music
 BadPiggy#5202: What the actual
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: > Did your team create the vast majority of the music during the 48 hours?
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: DM it to me and I'll rate it and try to beat it
 snuffysam#2767: yes, and they keep saying things like "i'm not lucky enough to beat this game" and "the dice fell into the water so i can't finish" which to me means they didn't quite get the point lol
 DitchCord#3896: Yep, walked right into that one.
 birdstone#3073: someone made a goddamn mmo in 2 days and that was so impressive
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: but balancing nightmare 😦
 BadPiggy#5202: For the sake of a jam, you can remove almost all of that, have 2 similar characters and just do local co-op kek
 NalaFala38290#9305: my game probably won't make the top 6200
 Ian Mykl#4218: as long as you're better than single sprite of a carrot running with no controls you'll be fine 🙂
 SeanSS#0892: Whats Mark's twitch channel?
 DitchCord#3896: Me thinking if i make fighting game i don't have to make "levels", lol.
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: it'S a hard achievement in itself to get last place
 BlankSlate#8922: People will usually point out softlocks if they think they got one
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: People say Mark has streamed the jam games last year. Is there a VOD?
 Koolento#6688: yep
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: My goal is...
Not last place
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: If I get top 6000 I'll be happy
 BadPiggy#5202: ( oinks in gratitude )
 Aurélien#3461: that really happened ?
 SeanSS#0892: Like you'd have to like balance the moves, make sure theres a variety of characters make sure that no one's too op, implement a smart ai for your opponent in versus modes, AND implement a good rollback netcode
 snuffysam#2767: i'm not sure if anyone's actually beaten my game, i feel like people don't notice that important puzzle objects respawn and just assume they're softlocked
 Koolento#6688: i love when games have no tutorial, so when im looking in the description for how to play i get this: "Best Game of the century baby"
 BadPiggy#5202: I can do enemy AI for a beat-em-up and even make some unique actions
But a fighting game AI is too much lol
 domjanabi#9370: i know you from the cherno server i believe
 BlankSlate#8922: Not to sound cocky or anything but I think my game will get in the top 6200 😎
 Tapu#9161: But the game is fun and has nice art
 theChief#0001: Consider yourself tempted
 domjanabi#9370: yooo it's bad piggy
 DitchCord#3896: Yeah, should have scaled it down. Got stuck in making SOCD for a day, lol. But all chains are loose now. Going all in.
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: Don't tempt me
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: making a fighting game is like all about knowing the very foundational basics and how to give them a twist to make your game interesting, all while keeping the game fairly balanced
 BadPiggy#5202: Lol. Not a chance
70% of the comments for my game are " found the game kinda hard " so I highly doubt it'll rank well in the end
 Relis#1309: not to mention in 48 hours lol
 BadPiggy#5202: As  said, making an actual fighting game is tough lol
 Tapu#9161: Your this jam's game is definitely getting top 100 
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: a fighting game would not work very well with randomness, i can tell you that very much as someone who plays fighting games!
 Digitaldude555#5515: even divekick must be hard to make.
 theChief#0001: I'd wager that zero people made an actual fighting game in 48 hours 😂
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: try to finish it by the end of the week and publish it anyway. It's about challenging yourself after all
 Digitaldude555#5515: I played a game with sans and now homer simpson 👀
 BadPiggy#5202: True, but there are a lot of differences between fighting games and beat-em-ups lol
 Speg#9708: Me when all jam games have been action puzzles
 SeanSS#0892: Making a good fighting game is really hard to make imo
 theChief#0001: You do a lot of beat em ups
 BlankSlate#8922: That game sure was a game that was made by a person
 BadPiggy#5202: I haven't made fighting games lol
I mean, a few beat-em-ups but that's all
 theChief#0001: But no, for jam games I don't think there's a genre filter sorry!
 Cameron#7818: Truly one of the games ever made.
 BlankSlate#8922: "Your game is the game of all time"
 NalaFala38290#9305: poor concept executed interestingly
 theChief#0001: Yeah, find  's itch account and scroll through their games 😂
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: nah I'd take that well.
 swarm#1128: "interesting concept" is the "you're cute" of gaming
 Jasper#7906: "Inspiring take on the theme!"
 BlankSlate#8922: I find that usually when someone starts a sentence with "Interesting concept" it is usually followed up with "executed poorly"
 DitchCord#3896: Is there a way to filter games by genre or something? Or is that too biased-driven? I want to check if there's some cool fighting games as i have an idea for one but being new to game dev, couldn't finish it in 2 days.
 Aurélien#3461: ok, kinda confusing
 Digitaldude555#5515: Your art gameplay and sound is subpar, intriguing idea and concept. 😭
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: depends on the reader
 BlankSlate#8922: Fascinating conceptualization
 Barikami#6623: I didnt' want to do a puzzle game or something so I took "Roll of the Dice" literally, that it's about a physical roll that dice people have 😄
 Digitaldude555#5515: oh no is interesting concept code for bad game??
 Cameron#7818: The comment is on someone else's game. (and then I noticed after that it's someone commenting on their own game)
 BadPiggy#5202: The write why you thought it was interesting. That usually gets you more browney points from the peep who made the game kek
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: rate other people's games and hope they rate you back
 Chowdog 宗翰#0135: Hit them with "Cool concept"
 Aurélien#3461: ? ?
 Koolento#6688: honestly, relatable
 Cameron#7818: It also wasn't on my game.
 Falcon#3043: but i have to its a curse
 Aurélien#3461: that hurt, just ignore. you can always improve you'r game after the Jam
 BadPiggy#5202: Uhh......
No comment XD
 swarm#1128: Then don't  🐍
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: Inside the edit game page, you can download the build exactly as it was uploaded
 Cameron#7818: Yes, but I also since noticed that it's the person who made the game.
 Falcon#3043: im tired of writing "Interesting concept"
 BadPiggy#5202: Wait, this is on the itch page right ? Some people that comment there usually don't care for the jam lol.
Unfortunate that he did though
 theChief#0001: There is a button!
 OrangoMango#0973: There os no button for downloading old builds right?
 Kyo Ricardo#4586: holy gigachad
 swarm#1128: "this game sucks the boredom out of you" but he pressed enter mid sentence
 Chowdog 宗翰#0135: Exchange feedback with others, or comment on others game
 Relis#1309: ahah lmao
 Cameron#7818: Oh, wait. It's the person who made the game. I am stupid.
 dardasaba#9759: Yes very detailed and constructive
 theChief#0001: Use a different file name and it'll come up separately
 Digitaldude555#5515: we fear his power
 Relis#1309: ah, nice and constructive feedback 😐
 Chowdog 宗翰#0135: The chad reviewer
 theChief#0001: Comment on a bunch of other games!
 NalaFala38290#9305: comment on other people's submissions
 OrangoMango#0973: how should I do this?
 theChief#0001: I did it one time because I thought I was deleting an old build 
 BadPiggy#5202: Bah. Ignore
 Cameron#7818: Me: trying to be careful with negative feedback since I know they only had 48 hours.
This chad: 
 Twelveoclock#2212: Hey guys. I think my game is quite good but it has not seen many views. What can I do to boost its visibility? I want it to be judged as fairly as possible 🙂
 theChief#0001: You can, depending on how you upload the new ones
 swarm#1128: i see button i click
 Relis#1309: why would anyone do that? 😦
 OrangoMango#0973: if after the jam I change the build of my game will I be able to see my jam's build afterwards?
 Digitaldude555#5515: yeah cause you can do it in most other jams. sneaky dudes
 DeanX#2107: 👍
 Chowdog 宗翰#0135: God bless
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: That's good
 theChief#0001: Yep, once mark releases his video he'll make the scores public and you'll be able to see your score ☺️
 syelan34#3258: Wow it seems like every single game has at least 1 review at this point, all the ones “in need of reviews” have 1 review
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: Ok, great imagination
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Nice
 Digitaldude555#5515: dont delete your game or its lost forever
 swarm#1128: Yes you can see the rank for each category and overall rank
 theChief#0001: No, new uploads are locked til the rating period is over
 Jasper#7906: Yes. A week from now when voting is done.
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: I know there will be a top 100, but will you be able to see in the top x  your own game got?
 theChief#0001: That is, unfortunately, a part of game development! 😅
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: No, no updating the game
 Static doodles#2251: Which is what I wanted from joining the jam
 Digitaldude555#5515: Game where you fly a rocket with fuel and have to take back material to your base, some material is more risky to get.
Shoot em up game where if you graze the bullets your score gets higher.
Game where you grow a ball while smaller balls fly that can pop it, the bigger the ball is the higher the score.
Game where you role a set of n dice then you have to guess if your next roll is higher or lower, if you get it wrong you lose your score, you can pocket the score at any time.
Game where you drop furniture down a building while people are walking, make sure the people dont get hit, every time you avoid hitting you get a bigger score.
there you go.
 DitchCord#3896: Yeah, just hope no diamond in the rough got lost is all.
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: I have no idea
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: that's a good upgrade
 DeanX#2107: Are we allowed to update the WebGl version of our game?
 swarm#1128: how is that possible lol
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: If I'm comparing to last year, at least this year I submitted in time
 domjanabi#9370: alright imma stop chatting time to rate 20+ games
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: I have like 10 comments and no ratings
 theChief#0001: Of course, but for 99% of people it shouldn't be viewed as a competition xD don't worry about how "well" you do. Don't worry about your ratings. The closest most people should get is viewing it as a competition with themselves, comparing their score to their previous jam games
 swarm#1128: Ratings are going up but no comments... I'm getting anxious
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: I tried to build for Widows but couldn't get it work, however I did get a web build working
 Jasper#7906: Winning = making a game. Works just fine with an apk 😉
 Omegnight#7081: I see this as a competition with myself, trying to achieve better than last year each time
 domjanabi#9370: lol
 Static doodles#2251: Indeed but atleast I learnt something
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: is that really a bad thing? As long as people thinks it's random, m i right?
 theChief#0001: Mac or Android only builds would be disqualified I think, actually - the rules say it has to be playable on a Windows computer
 Koolento#6688: i guess you cant prevent people from treating this like a competition, people want the clout
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: Also, the outline is just a black rounded cube with inversed normals, but this is an old trick.
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: At least your rng works. Mine decided to always use the same seed, so everyone has the same experience
 snuffysam#2767: Windows maybe, APK or Mac? Doubt it.
Games with only Mac builds often don’t even run on other Mac’s with how restrictive security stuff is nowadays. As someone with a Mac, I’d honestly rather have a Windows build so I can run it in a VM.
And if you’re trying to win with just an APK, forget it TBH.
Thats a little harsh but there’s a reason the rules say you must have a web or windows build
 theChief#0001: There is no winner, no prize, and it is largely not down to skill. Luck had a BIG influence on how some jam games perform - you could get a bunch of people who don't like the genre of game you've made play, for example!
It's not a competition 😂 imagine any other competitive thing where luck takes such a big role!
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: put that on the "never ever do that again" list
 Static doodles#2251: Sometimes it's too easy and sometimes it's a nightmare
 domjanabi#9370: lmao
it's great though now you have a die that you can let the player roll and it'll still work
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: Me: Iterate over 6 directional components representing dice values and see which one points up-ish
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: 🤔
 Static doodles#2251: I really regret making my game difficulty based on rng
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: the theme was fine, the point *is* working within restrictions, if it was something like "make a paltformer idk" it wouldn't have been very interesting. there have been better themes though
 LOPSTERu#3902: Is it a better to reply to the comments on your game?
 dardasaba#9759: True, one of the comments I got was "there was not enough randomness", when the way I interpreted the theme wasn't about randomness (although I did have some random numbers between 1-6 determining some of the stuff)
 Indigu#6862: That's kind of how it is viewed though, with the top 100 and stuff
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: I... shoot i should have done it that way
 Jasper#7906: I remember the "one button" theme from some game jam on Newgrounds back in the day. Even if it was only from a text video based on an audio reading of a review of a submitted game. (The reviewer completely missed that the game was making fun of the theme (and probably that there was a theme at all), and the audio track pronounced all the spelling errors, the result was amazing.)
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: Reasonable people: store the current value of the dice in a variable and change it as the dice rotates.
 MrBen#0001: well ok then
 theChief#0001: Yep! Absolutely. Tbh, games with fewer ratings tend to do better - getting a lot of ratings will give you a better sense of how "good" people think your game is on average, but it will average out any excessively low or high ratings
On the flip side, you could be really lucky and get a bunch of high ratings that your game doesn't necessarily deserve, so you'd score higher.
Bear in mind though, that this __is not a competition__
 SleepyJeff#9492: yeah I actually take the concept of randomness
 Indigu#6862: I've had that idea at first, happy to see someone implement it
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: It really sticks out
 Squishy Turtle#3988: It’s all about creative interpretations 🙃 in my game the distance you *roll* is determined by  the sides of a *dice*
 domjanabi#9370: one of my first ideas was
a turtle race where you roll a die to see what position you're supposed to reach the finish line in
like if the die says  [° o] you're supposed to finish 2nd
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: That was one of the first games I rated
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: that is slightly against the rules
 DitchCord#3896: That too, i suppose, i don't have linux pc tho.
 Koolento#6688: yep honestly if you can everyone should port to web, if you look at the page "in need of reviews" most are on native platforms
 MrBen#0001: DM me if u want me to review ur game
 Hawkshaw#1364: Do you have a link? I had the same idea but felt I wouldn't manage the art for it
 Occelot Dan#3777: LMAO now that is beautiful
 Aegard#2715: I think it was an awesome theme, out of the 5 games we made for the GMTK jams, this is our fav one and we came up with a ton of ideas during concept 😮
My personal mission as a designer was to avoid doing "random stuff" though, it gave me a welcome additional challenge ^^
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: What about Linux?
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: come up with 5 different ideas for that interpretation and I'll gladly listen to your complaint
 Indigu#6862: I've seen a game where someone would dice sushi rolls
 MrBen#0001: I made a game for Windows only and it got 25 reviews :)
 Digitaldude555#5515: in a smaller jam yeah, here? doubt it.
 Squishy Turtle#3988: For real I can’t do jams with out themes. I feel lost
 Occelot Dan#3777: I think it was hard to look past the use of literal dice, but I saw some folks take it as "playing around with randomness in mechanics" and that line of thinking led to some really cool concepts.
 DitchCord#3896: Man, can the APK/Windows/Mac games even make it to top 200? I tried some browser games and it's fun but i'm not so incline to download and install stuffs.
 MrBen#0001: so true
 Digitaldude555#5515: roll of the dice means take a chance, and none of the game I played have this element.
 theChief#0001: Tbh the theme isn't that important, it's mostly a creative constraint to help with blank canvas syndrome
 domjanabi#9370: i wouldn't say the theme was too restrictive tbh
like, the point of the theme is to be restrictive, and this one definitely made choosing a concept easy
 MrBen#0001: true
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: not judging or anything, it was good after all
 Squishy Turtle#3988: It seems too many people saw roll of the dice and assumed you **must** have randomness
 SquidGeneral10#4090: 🗿
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Probably because there is an object in the theme, which wasn't the case for Joined Together or Only One
 Koolento#6688: i feel like the best themes are the ones that are phrased like a limitation, eg "only one" was really good
 Static doodles#2251: It's a really fun theme to think about
 Digitaldude555#5515: in 2 days? yooo
 MrBen#0001: oof my pc got broken
 KadDev#8100: well there is a particle system, but from what i've seen, it's not as good as the one in unity
 theChief#0001: I think it was fine, and so did most other people 😂 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 SAGIII#2881: I agree but that was a cool theme anyway.
 Hawkshaw#1364: I just haven't made them before. Lots have been made for the jam
 Klemp#9694: I was going to code in a particle system by hand, but it just didn't work
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: also true, but it felt somehow restrictive
 Jasper#7906: In the pre-yoyogames days, GM had the beginnings of a particle system, IIRC. Did they never expand upon that?
 Hawkshaw#1364: Thanks 🙂 Really appreciate it
 theChief#0001: That's not true at all xD dice can be:
- visuals. A dice-based visual style was pretty common
- it could me random generation - that could be level design, randomised loot, randomised stats, etc etc etc
- it could mean actual rolling
There are a bunch of different interpretations!
 SquidGeneral10#4090: Ahhh holy shit! Big fan. Really unique take on the lore and level designs 👀
 Hawkshaw#1364: Indeed I am
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: has no onemade a board game?
 Aurélien#3461: funny, because in my game, my team and I thought it would more fun if all the enemies move toward the player.
 KadDev#8100: ***gamemaker studio 2 would be so nice with an update***
- The name is kinda bad 
- the rotation system is bad 
- a particle system like unity would be kinda nice
-html5 is buggy
- they could put some more effort into the 3D version, or cut it out completely and put all effort into 2D
this is just my opinion but **gamemaker studio 2 is still great...**
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: I did mine on a weak Microsoft Surface Go on Arch Linux
 honiemun#0001: You should get bonus points for this
 SquidGeneral10#4090: Yo, are you the same Hawkshaw that did those Dark Souls lore videos?
 Phil ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ#3392: Will the games be rated by how good the average rating is or the amount of ratings it got?
 Static doodles#2251: Instantly thought of the miracle matter boss fight from Kirby when I saw the theme
 Klemp#9694: At least that works consistently
 OrangoMango#0973: I did the game jam on a raspberry pi XD
 SAGIII#2881: I'm used to work in a team but it was the first time with random people.
 Spico#6316: is no new ratings in the past hour good or bad
if its bad ill literally rate more games to get more karma
im gonna rate more anyway
 Hawkshaw#1364: I feel similar. As always, it was a bit of a trap, but I personally found it harder to think of ideas. Though I've not done board games generally so it is quite refreshing
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: limited the possibilities a lot. There is only so much you can do with dice
 Fumiga#0368: For our game we kinda rushed a 'release' moved by sheer desperation. So yeah it's probably buggy and definitely non-polished lmao. Definitely the most fun I've had on a jam though
 Klemp#9694: issue: my computer is a potato
 wzyanggg#5277: Dice is a hard theme, it can hardly make ACT games, only turn-based
 Relis#1309: i guess working in a team can be a blessing or a curse
 theChief#0001: Ah that sucks, I'm sorry to hear it!
 Jasper#7906: I went with swinging swords instead of shooting. To be fair, though, it's all just an abstract representation anyway, so I'm only one icon swap away from shooting being in my game 😁
 OrangoMango#0973: just use pyinstaller
 domjanabi#9370: imagine having enough time to make a devlog during the gmtk gamejam
 honiemun#0001: Oh choice! I love that channel. _(and Move or Die, too)_
 SAGIII#2881: The idea was too ambitious, people gave up for no reason so the overall motivation decreased.
 Klemp#9694: I spent 5 hours trying to port python to an exe
 Indigu#6862: Ehhhh it was ight
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: Apparently the guy behind Mental Checkpoint has also participated. And it seems to look _good_
 wzyanggg#5277: I didnt think I could finish it before 8 hours of deadline
 domjanabi#9370: very nice, it limited the possible concepts a lot
 honiemun#0001: It was fine! Open for interpretation for sure. It's hard to design games that can include randomness and also feel fair, though
 CFHM#9742: I'm a big board game fan so I loved the theme
 Klemp#9694: The shooting in my game is broken and ridiculously dumb.
 Spico#6316: made a game i would otherwise have not, quite good
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: oh noo...
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i'm going to learn how to do grappling hooks in first person 3d games now
 Static doodles#2251: Actually enjoy it abit
 Indigu#6862: In what sense?
 OrangoMango#0973: me too that's why I have like 80mb just for java
 Hawkshaw#1364: What did people think of the theme this year?
 theChief#0001: A fail how?
 SAGIII#2881: Hello, my game jam has been a big fail, hope it was better for you guys.
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: > yo why is like half the games shooting
Almost read as "shooting to move"
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: the theme could have been better, you're right
 JQ2#4402: I packaged Java along with mine. *get on my level*
 swarm#1128: depends on the engine. With Godot the runtime is around 25 Mb + whatever assets you have
 domjanabi#9370: uk i love c++ but goddamn i would _not_ want to make a game in it
 Spico#6316: no shooting in mine either, but you die eventually regardless of anything
 Relis#1309: mine is 32mb
 Klemp#9694: Mine was fucking python at 56 mb
 honiemun#0001: I've downloaded 800mb jam games in the past
 Static doodles#2251: Oh dang it should have thought of that
 OrangoMango#0973: mine is 90mb..
 SquidGeneral10#4090: 'cause the theme was very limiting
 theChief#0001: There is no normal size. My games tend to be about 50mb, some games are 500+
 domjanabi#9370: mine with godot was 40 mb
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: _Fun fact: Unreal Game build gets 50mb lighter if you start it as a C++ project_
 NalaFala38290#9305: my game is less than 150 kb
 JQ2#4402: *(and no, everything is fine, why are you asking?)*
 Kritical#4329: mine is 25mb
 Speg#9708: lol is there another shoot to move game?
 CFHM#9742: People aren't hear to create the next Celeste or Stardew or new big thing. Making a game, any game, is an achievement
 theChief#0001: At least in my game not all of the enemies move towards you 😉 two of them don't move, one of them moves towards you, and one of them had really cool movement that is unfortunately completely broken xD
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: the problem is that most of them look like a 5 year old uploaded his drawings
 OrangoMango#0973: whats the normal size for a windows game?
 Skirlez#5521: i feel like i'm being called out here
 domjanabi#9370: yo i love 2-colour-pallete games
 WorkingJoe#4433: I landed on 180mb even though I don't have sound or textures Xd. Used a 3D engine for a 2D game and couldn't build with "removing unused files" enabled because it seemed to delete something critical to display important parts of the game
 Koolento#6688: relatively easy to make + popular genre
 Spico#6316: honestly im just happy that i finally got a release out there after one year of struggling on making it to deadlines
 Static doodles#2251: Fun to play and easy to make
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: now i want strawberry jam pancakes...
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: just need to pick out the right ones
 theChief#0001: Because those games are easy and fun 😂 I love making those sorts of game
 Klemp#9694: This was my first jam. I am happy. Yay
 Spico#6316: still gonna update the game tho
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: hey, first jams are for this, they're your first pancake jam
 Digitaldude555#5515: yo why is like half the games shooting ones, run around shoot enemies that move towards you....
 Skirlez#5521: hell yeah
 Spico#6316: i had no idea that would affect anything, it hit me once i started browsing the game jams pages
 JQ2#4402: Sharing it here would be against the rules! But if you go to 'review my game' and search for 'Jason' I posted it like, not 15 minutes back
 domjanabi#9370: 😔 i wish i had thought of that
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Same with my 4.5 kB browser masterpiece
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: this is why you do your prep before the jam starts! i learned how to do webgl exports for itch the day before the jam started
 Spico#6316: REALLY good first impression then?
 honiemun#0001: Seeing how it was 40 USD for a Windows and Mac upload, it's a worse deal, but if it works for you then nothing wrong with that 😅
 domjanabi#9370: pog
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Share it here, and ill play it
 Crusher#6146: It's just the HTML5 export template you need to chose / download
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: I'll download and play it, DM it to me
 Cletus2000#0709: Facts
 Spico#6316: i like that mindset
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: for me also, I made a tutorial in game and realized that I could write the instructions on itch only after finishing it
 domjanabi#9370: i thought you have to like
do the whole process differently
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: Am I the only person who is fine paying £10 per month instead of having to buy it outright if I only use it a few times a year
 theChief#0001: has to be better than no cover at all 😉
 Koolento#6688: yes you click export project :D
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: ╮ (. ❛ _ ❛.) ╭
 Spico#6316: literally my first game jam
 JQ2#4402: your new cover is great don't let anyone tell you different
 Stopa#6148: so judging by other messages here if my CTR is 2.07%, that's like really good?
 theChief#0001: no, and after the video is released as far as I'm aware
 honiemun#0001: Godot game in clutch last second. My Windows build didn't work but the HTML5 version worked without issues
 Lyfe#8258: one flaw with sorting by lowest number of ratings is that a lot of them straight up havent got anything uploaded
 domjanabi#9370: is making a web version easy with godot?
 Koolento#6688: now you know
 Galactum#6235: is the video going to be uploaded as soon as the voting period ends? if not, will the top 100 be publicly available after the voting period ends or after the video is released?
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: yeah
 Spico#6316: FUCK WHY DID I NOT MAKE A WEB PORT
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: good enough for me
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: does, my game is a godot web game
 honiemun#0001: screw gamemaker's new SaaS model
 domjanabi#9370: i do mean a full on horror game tho
like terrifying stuff
 Spico#6316: i dont even know if godot has a web export support
 Indigu#6862: We kind of made a "horror" game but it's more just kinda spooky than straight up horror
 LOPSTERu#3902: gamemaker makes you pay more money to export a web build so yeah
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: pretty sure I saw some
 theChief#0001: ah but if you uploaded a buggy webgl game (and lets face it, most unity webgl games are buggy) that's all people will comment on xD
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: Yeah. It's just that Unreal has decided to remove building for web, that's the unfortunate part.
 Spico#6316: sometimes no, i came up with the idea the first day
 JQ2#4402: My CTR went up by 0.05% *I am a marketing genious*
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: that always takes the most time, doesn't it?
 Relis#1309: tbf is understandable
 domjanabi#9370: OMG if someone made a horror game based on dice that would be so epic they'd win the gamejam by all possible means
 Spico#6316: that happens way too much i hate it
i understand it but i hate it
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: Welp, there's one aspect I (and probably any others) are losing plays on: not having an in-browser play. Also related to the security concern stuff.
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: yeah but my game is barely a game, I couldn't come up with any ideas
 theChief#0001: I think it updates every few hours xD
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: I mean we have a week of ratings still, don't we? There is time for things to change
 Kritical#4329: tbh I would normally click off too sometimes
 theChief#0001: ah if you got a build early on you'll have done pretty well!
 Spico#6316: time to paranoidly click the refresh button on my games statistics and be sad that it probably doesnt update inmediately
 Jasper#7906: Nope. All I did was post in  several times over the weekend (and I did have a build that I considered to be fun to play pretty early on)
 Relis#1309: yeah i think that applies to mine too. 830 impressions, 6 downloads 😅
 Kritical#4329: sure
 OrangoMango#0973: there is no button anymore for changing the background for example
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: DM it to me and I'll play it
 Speg#9708: 😭 😭 😭 I mean it's a jam game it's not supposed to be the craziest thing ever
 Spico#6316: how do market
 Indigu#6862: I wouldn't worry about impressions or ctr too much, the statistic that matters the most is ratings (if your game isn't a shit post) but I wouldn't worry about that either. 's game has triple my impressions but I have triple his ratings, this doesn't mean one game is better than the other but instead how nice itch has been to you so far in this first day. Just make games not that deep
 honiemun#0001: Never too late to spice up your page! The initial wave of post-jam game browsing is slowing down, but some better promotional certainly helps to get more eyes on it
 theChief#0001: have you got twitter or some other social media? XD
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: your page yes, your game no
 OrangoMango#0973: It's still possible to edit page aspect?
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: If my game was actually good, I'd be doing marketing, but since it's trash...
 theChief#0001: you can obsess over the numbers if you like, but it's definitely down to _who_ sees your game, and _what context_ they see it in. For example, if you're bottom of the "lowest rated" section, everyone who sees it there is probably going to click it
 Jasper#7906: 26.2k Impressions - 0.95% CTR; no idea why my impressions number is so high
 Speg#9708: Classic
 Spico#6316: pain
129 views but 38 downloads
 Kritical#4329: people probably clicked away from my game after seeing no web build
 OrangoMango#0973: me too
 Speg#9708: I hope it's not too late for numbers to go up because I want to do some "marketing" tonight but maybe things are slowing down on the second day
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: I only added the cover image this morning because itch was having issues yesterday
 Spico#6316: higher than mine probably is
 Kritical#4329: i have one dice
 theChief#0001: ultimately it doesn't really matter xD
 Wenlong#7472: Time to make a clickbait cover everyone
 OrangoMango#0973: is 1.07% fine?
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: Can't be as bad as mine. I placed 6 dice around the screen, put the title in the center, and called it a cover image
 Speg#9708: Seems fine from what others are saying
 Spico#6316: 1.4k here, 0.93% CTR
 theChief#0001: _maybe_, if you've got a lot of impressions xD
if you've got <500-1000 impressions, it's probably more a measure of how many people you have review swapped with 😛
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: true, wait for the end of the jam and add the music
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: 1700 impressions, 1.2% CTR. Alright but I've had better.
 Omegnight#7081: To add to that, it indirectly shows you if your thumbnail/title is cool or not
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: Seriously, I wonder what did I do to make the algo disfavor me with only 600 impressions.
 Kritical#4329: 858 impressions dont know if thats good probably not
 Spico#6316: why don't you update it later though?
its the attempt that counts i say go for it anyway
 JQ2#4402: This guy knows what he's talking about
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: I think we are all on the same page
 Speg#9708: How many impressions?
 theChief#0001: click through rate - the percentage of people who clicked your game after seeing it
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: auuuuuuughhhhhh i wish i was fast enough that i could spend 2-3 hours making a song for the game..... i would've loved to make something super arcadey for it
 Spico#6316: i added a gif to it very recently i hope that makes up for the CTR a bit more, really should have done that last night
 Kritical#4329: the cover image is shit so probably its not being shown to anyone
 OrangoMango#0973: what is CTR?
 theChief#0001: your game's analytics page
 Speg#9708: Yeah idk i kinda of forgot what are standard numbers for itch, i know i only have 1k impressions rn 💀
 𝐿𝒾𝒸𝒢 [Dice Wars]#4934: No clue, it's more than mine tho
 Indigu#6862: Could you send your game in DMs brother?
 theChief#0001: either it isn't being shown to many people (check your impressions) or you've got a really good cover image!
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: It's just a list of games
 Shimp#0064: btw, anyone wants me to rate their game? randomizer is cool and all, but maybe someone is struggling with people clicking on the game. dm me if you want me to do it
 Hemera#2002: where can one see that 👀
 theChief#0001: 6k impressions - so it's fine 😛
 Koolento#6688: how many people saw the thumbnail
 Indigu#6862: That's pretty good, I've got 0.6
 domjanabi#9370: i _bet_ that's some kinda itch io thing that i'm too ignorant to find out about
 Kritical#4329: i have a 1.75 CTR why...how???
 OrangoMango#0973: what does this number mean?
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I'll have to check mine when I get home. I'm curious.
 Speg#9708: Probably because you have a lot of impressions, so it's not too bad right ?
 Spico#6316: also what foes 7d impressions mean?
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: Just make a collection, it's what I'm doing
 Speg#9708: Click through rate, basically if a lot of people clicked when they saw your thumbnail or passed
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: Not really a sandbox, it just runs it as a different user, so your personal files are safer
 Spico#6316: 0.93% is that even an okay number
 Relis#1309: mine is at 0.48% lol, what a shame
 theChief#0001: nope!
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: Huh, thanks for letting me know.
 OrangoMango#0973: it's possible to view my current ratings?
 domjanabi#9370: got 22 tabs open of games that i'm gonna rate lol
 theChief#0001: click through rate - the percentage of people who clicked your game after seeing it
 Spico#6316: how do i see where people come in from though?
 Hemera#2002: what is CTR?
 theChief#0001: ah I see. If you've got the number of ratings for every game, though, why would you not just do the median properly
 swarm#1128: itch app has already a sandbox
 Jasper#7906: I was really just saying that if you use the mean average over everything but the highest ones, you'll get much better ballpark estimate of the median average than when you straight up take the mean average
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: Am I paranoid because I'm installing a VM to play the jam games because I'm _really_ picky on what I launch on my machine?
 Spico#6316: randomised?
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: 0.75% CTR
 Indigu#6862: I've got 54 visits from the randomised, it seems to be the saving grace
 Speg#9708: 💀 💀 💀
 theChief#0001: if you want to work out median, this is some C# code for you:
```cs
public static double GetMedian
{
//make sure the list is sorted, but use a new array
double[] sortedPNumbers = sourceNumbers.Clone();
Array.Sort;
//get the median
int size = sortedPNumbers.Length;
int mid = size / 2;
double median =  ? (double)sortedPNumbers[mid] : ((double)sortedPNumbers[mid] + (double)sortedPNumbers[mid - 1]) / 2;
return median;
}```
 unityAccount#7810: Thanks!
 theChief#0001: at the top of the game page (not the submission page), there's an "analytics" button!
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: > top 100
The intention was to say "there are better games to be played"
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: Well my karma is gonna go sky high, cause nobody rates my game
 Lyfe#8258: no not yet
 unityAccount#7810: How can you see the impressions of the game?
 Spico#6316: if you play it after you finish it and enjoy it, you have done a good job 90%
 theChief#0001: no, this is a funky version of mean - it's not the median 😂
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: Yeah, I guess the algo didn't like my game much. Oh well, it's objectively not near the top 100, so, whatever
 domjanabi#9370:  did you see my comment
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i have made a stunning realization: making a videogame that people like is tough
 theChief#0001: 1-2% CTR is good. 3+ is VERY good
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: Yes but they have a lot of ratings so karma doesn't matter as much
 Occelot Dan#3777: Hey if any of y'all want at least one more view/rating/comment on your game, dm it my way! I'm snapping up as many as I can 🤘
Also, don't forget the fact that you got anything completed and submitted is an incredible feat to be proud of 
 Lyfe#8258: oh im streaming the jam games in a different server rn if you wanna watch
 Speg#9708: Wait the difference??? So that's why most top karma games have few votes
 Indigu#6862: Oh not just how many games you rated? That's why there's a lot of low quality games there
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: So if someone got a ton of ratings,  they'd have really low karma and nothing they could do about it?
 theChief#0001: it is not 😛 impressions is how many times your cover image was shown to someone on a web page. I'm currently at 6,000 😅
 Jasper#7906: Take the ratings, subtract the top page when sorted by number of ratings, divide by the number of games (minutes the number on the first page) and you'll get a much more accurate estimate
 SaadTheGlad#9716: It's gonna be a nostalgia trip going through everybody's dms and finding people from last jam
 theChief#0001: you also get more karma if you comment! Pretty sure you get more for leaving a decent comment, too
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: Your karma is linked to the difference between how many games you've rated Vs how many people have rated yours
 Chowdog 宗翰#0135: Oh oh that makes sense
 SaadTheGlad#9716: I remember that!
 Fusoy#6101: You have high karma if you rated a lot of games and yours do not have much ratings
 domjanabi#9370: yo that's such a cool system, there's incentive to rate them
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: Impressions will be high cause of the amount of people scrolling down the game list
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Ofcourse
 dardasaba#9759: You get karma by playing and rating other people's games, the "most karma" shows the games of people with... Most karma! xD
 Spico#6316: the ones that have rated alot of games get their games advertised at the top there
 Chowdog 宗翰#0135: What does "Most karma" mean at the submimssion page?
 birdstone#3073: genius
 theChief#0001: I was right 😂
 theChief#0001: hey what do you know, it's 5
 Digitaldude555#5515: take the rating divide by entries and thats a median estimate.
 Spico#6316: i have my friend covering me on that one
he made too-good art literally 2 hours after i published it
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: I'm trying to assess if it's the almighty algorithms not giving me views or if people aren't interested. 630 impressions - 21 views - 8 downloads.
 Indigu#6862: All of that is in vain if your game cover isn't catchy though
 theChief#0001: the median was 4 last time I checked, it's probably 5 or 6 now
 Speg#9708: The evil strats 😈
 theChief#0001: you need to get the jam ID (with a bit of inspect element)
then you can loop through them all and calculate the median!
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: how many impressions do you guys with high downloads have?
 birdstone#3073: OH whoops i misinterpreted
 Indigu#6862: You can shout out good games in your comments since your game will only get more views
 Lyfe#8258: like low numbers of ratings not low quality
 Spico#6316: ooo i havent thought of that, i have been commenting on every single game i rated, which are the ones that have the most karma, ill check it out
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: I woke up to two comments, both of them were that they liked the run animationn for my character which looks like the naruto run lmao
 domjanabi#9370: i believe it helps to leave comments in popular games' submission pages
 birdstone#3073: oi that isn't very good
 Spico#6316: i feel that on a personal level :pain:
 Ennio#4334: YOOOO Slam, absolutely loved your critical commentary on the banality of dice and the absolutely realistic yet stylised experience of throwing a dice. 10/10 absolute classic
 Falcon#3043: did you just r-ratio me ???
 domjanabi#9370: how nice :)
 Lyfe#8258: im rating as many games with low ratings just to fight this injustice
 birdstone#3073: I expected a lot lower because I remember last year i had to get so many people to play just to get like 10 reviews lol
 Spico#6316: imagine having 51 reviews
i woke up to one and it literally made my day
 Manuel4o5#1038: Every jam I participated so far (3 to be exact) no matter the team there is always a game made in seconds that gets a ton of ratings. I always find it very funny.
 Falcon#3043: oh god how do you do such a thing😱
 birdstone#3073: jesus i woke up to 51 reviews that spooked me
 Speg#9708: Normally there's quite a few on twitch but when I looked up last time I couldn't find any so yeah idk
 Kritical#4329: just checked your game out its incredible
 Relis#1309: oh wow my first comment 😯 at least i know the game works 😂
 Spico#6316: i think its alright, i only have 8 or so
 Indigu#6862:  you actually played our game too I'm pretty sure, the spooky text rpg one
 Falcon#3043: is having only 4 reviews so far bad?😨
 Speg#9708: Some people rate on stream, if you go to 20 of these stream you're already past the median of last year
 Toboter#5206: You just need to get lucky and get raters with low standards 😉
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: Just search GMTKjam on Twitch and YouTube, and on YouTube filter for streams
 Speg#9708: Ok yeah true, someone might consider 4 a perfect rating, when really to get in the top 100 you need way more than 4...
 Äml#2258: Where can you see that
 Lyfe#8258: i mean sure ill put it in review my game channel
 Toboter#5206: I don't think game request streams help much? I can't imagine people go rate stuff they see in those themselves.
 dardasaba#9759: I did about 20
 Spico#6316: damn it really feels like even when you are done with this whole thing you have to scrape by on advertisement
 Indigu#6862: Filter by "most rated" and click on the one with the cute cat
 Ennio#4334: Wanna see it ahahahah
 domjanabi#9370: can you like link it????
 Spico#6316: where do you even find game request streams?
 Indigu#6862: It's been like that from the first hour wdym bro 💀
 Speg#9708: Well yes and no, I think you can push your luck if you go to enough game request streams and other places to post it, unless you mean the luck for mark to pick it once it's in the top 100?
 Toboter#5206: People don't vote consistently.
 Lyfe#8258: I BEG YOUR PARDON, 2ND MOST RATED GAME ON THE JAM?????? i am actually going to scream
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: Mine doesn't use an engine either, Web build is about 800KB, Desktop is around 1.2MB (I used raylib for graphics)
 Indigu#6862: You don't know? That's how I found your game
 Toboter#5206: If games are good enough, it's really just randomness.
 Speg#9708:  what's your gut feeling on this 😈
 domjanabi#9370: i can not believe that that's what the game actually looks like in 
 Lyfe#8258: what
 Jasper#7906: Look for games that don't use an engine. Mine doesn't and is under 1MB, and I suspect other games without an engine will also be small
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: Including 1 view that came directly from my Itch page instead of the Jam
 dhafo#4640: oh lol i havent even checked that stuff yet LOL i've only done discord people so far
 Speg#9708: Last year we made a game about a robot connecting to a spark to get powered up and day one of the votes we found one game that had a scarily similar concept but way more polished and prettier 💀💀💀
And sure enough it got in the video and we really thought we were done for
 Indigu#6862: It's the second most rated game
 Lyfe#8258: The Greatest Game On The Planet
 domjanabi#9370: rel
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: Trust me it is, it barely stays connected
 Spico#6316: huh
 Indigu#6862: That guy that wrote a whole ass review in over an hour. I was rolling
 unityAccount#7810: What's the title of your game?
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: If you want you can change your rating
 dhafo#4640: wait slam u made a gmtk one? can i see it
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: 45 views, 6 plays, 5 ratings
 Lyfe#8258: i dont even care it was just kinda funny seeing the comment reactions
 domjanabi#9370: i have a feeling your internet was not at fault 😂
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: my game has 22 plays so far!
 Kritical#4329: sus
 unityAccount#7810: I have got 5 ratings with a project that doesn't even load
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Ask theChief for his gut feeling
 Kritical#4329: my net is actually good for a change
 dhafo#4640: so far 1 game has been scarily similar to mine LOL scared maybe my concept was not as creative as i thought haha
 Spico#6316: though lads, i would care to interfere, look away from the reviews a little bit and look at how much your games have been downloaded! My game has like above 30 so far the numbers are way higher there!
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: You guys can download stuff??
 Speg#9708: Any idea on how to check the current median for vote count actually ?
 dhafo#4640: dang sat here for like almost an hour and only rated 3 games so far lol
 domjanabi#9370: routinely i get comments from people with 20+ ratings
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: It is alot 🥲
 Speg#9708: The median this year gonna be 200 votes lol
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: My Internet is so bad it took an hour to download a small unreal engine game
 Spico#6316: i made my game in all 48 hours, more like 24 since i slept but
 Lyfe#8258: DID YOU SEE THE GAMEPLAY TRAILER SOMEONE MADE i love it so much
 domjanabi#9370: damn lmao i thought i had a lot with my 8 reviews
 Speg#9708: Personally we made most of our game in 24 hours because we had to restart from scratch midway through 💀 💀 💀
 Indigu#6862: I've legit recorded videos of the comments to my friends, you un-ironically created the funniest game in the jam
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: I'm somewhere with absolute trash connection rn
Discord can run but nothing else at the same time and images/videos in discord won't even work
So I can only play and rate like 1 out of 10 games so I probably have a really bad karma score
 Spico#6316: wdym
i think you got the wrong message
 Speg#9708: One hour before the deadline, or one hour because why not?
 Lyfe#8258: the one and only, i love that i have such great fans
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: Fun fact: a decent amount of my entry was coded in a McDonald's
 Indigu#6862: Oh the greatest game ever? You're the creator of that breathtaking masterpiece? I told you once and I will say it again: please marry my daughter.
 Speg#9708: True, less control, I guess if I really think about it, it is indeed more stressful but I try to not think about it 💀
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: there was tons of clever puzzle games
 Spico#6316: that way of thinking really gets some games off the radar though, i get that not many people want to download gamejam files but so many good ones get dismissed because of that
 Lyfe#8258: i made a game in about an hour as a joke, it wasnt the slime skating one cuz that sounds actually good
 Speg#9708: The reason why I love making games, seeing people experience what you cooked for them !! And this is why jams are so cool, because you know you'll be able to see this at least a few times, especially with the game playing streams on twitch, love these
 Toboter#5206: Might be a feedback loop. Someone randomly rated you a lot, so you ended up in "Popular", so people rated you more, etc.
 Indigu#6862: Your game is the skating slime one, right? Really liked the puzzles on that one
 Feesh#2467: yeah theres such a bizarre difference in ratings XD i mean more than a hundred in the first day is wild
 Skirlez#5521: honestly i preferred the game dev stress since if a flaw is discovered i can fix it
 Spico#6316: rate other games, the more you rate i think the further your game goes on the karma sort
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: you can filter by web games only, that will save time
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Jeez
I have 5
But totally not a good game so yeah deserved
 Toboter#5206: By rating games
 Spico#6316: man tell me your trick i need aid on that myself :boohoo:
 Lyfe#8258: ive been trying to play ones with low ratings to even it out but its such an ordeal having to download them and stuff
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: somehow I got 5, I was at 0 when I went to sleep last night
 Speg#9708: Yeaaah i feel you, but at the same time it's a different type of stress, more like anticipation, I'm just glad I can go to sleep without feeling guilty now honestly lol
 Indigu#6862: I still don't understand the karma system, how do you get karma?
 Spico#6316: yeah, i guess the karma sort is an option to find some good games
 photodiode#9634: Seeing people play your game and getting feedback is so satisfying ❤️
 Lyfe#8258: i am genuinely baffled at how i have 278 ratings on my game so far, and some games have like 3
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: Also I'm on Linux which makes things harder
 Skirlez#5521: no i'm still super stressed about how my game is doing rating wise
 Indigu#6862: I find a lot of amazing games, and then I look at the stats and they have 3 comments and 6 ratings. A lot of this stuff is luck
 Speg#9708: The best part of these jams is when everything is done and you just sit back, play other games and watch people play your game and see how they do
 Spico#6316: i got kinda thinking though, i wonder how in the past game jams there were so many games submitted too, i wonder how many great ones went under the radar
 unityAccount#7810: Playing any game(s) currently Mark? (non-jam)
 Lyfe#8258: but other people could play it so i just left it
 Skirlez#5521: 14 games
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: 24!
 Indigu#6862: 21
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: Honestly, I don't see _the point_ in wanting to modify a jam version after the deadline.
Isn't the whole appeal in "what can I do in that amount of time?"?
 Toboter#5206: 13. I'm winning! 😉
 Speg#9708: Haven't been able to rate games, was too tired after the jam, but now I gotta get on with it 😈
 Lyfe#8258: nah its not uploading i literally cant play half of them, including MY OWN GAME
 Spico#6316: rated 15 games so far, quite cool games out there
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: Just wondering how many games everyone has rated so far? I'm at 11 games rated.
 Mark Brown#6982: Just for the avoidance of all doubt - I will be streaming, but I don't have anything to tell you about it currently. I know you're very excited for me to stream and that's really flattering. Details will be shared in all the usual places - here, Twitter, YouTube. You won't miss it!
 photodiode#9634: We'll probably get an announcement for the stream in "please-read" when it goes live
 Phallo#3476: ive had a couple of minor issues with it when making games but overall that hasnt stopped me and all of my past games have been uploaded in webgl... so far 🤞
 Relis#1309: the webgl paradox: if you don't have a webgl build no one is going to see your game, but if you have a webgl build it probably wont work XD
 Indigu#6862: "nothing to announce currently"
 Tonyl#1885: Yeah, I think it's mostly how Itch.io handles Unity games with compression.
 DavidF#3965: I guess people are wondering where we should follow to get updates on the list
 Merus#7019: mark, can you announce whether my risotto is done?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: do you have anything to announce currently, sorry?
 Speg#9708: What if this year it wasn't a list and randomly picked games but instead a game of Tetris royale and whoever wins get their games to be played 🤔
 Mark Brown#6982: Nothing to announce currently, sorry
 ThatIsANoNoWord#5311: Will you annaounce when you are streaming?
 Lyfe#8258: god its so annoying how unity webgl games only work about half the time for me 😭
 vanilla#0006: good morning
 Mark Brown#6982: Nothing to announce currently, sorry!
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Is there even going to be a list? Because you said you will be playing random games
 Mark Brown#6982: Nothing to announce currently, sorry!
 Mark Brown#6982: Yep
 shenalkm#1022: running a community seems hard work 😅
 Tonyl#1885: I delete them manually now, yes.
 DavidF#3965: Great! Where will the link to the list be posted?
 Omegnight#7081: But maybe delete the scores of people who put profanity names?
 Tonyl#1885: Cheers Mark, missed that, sorry.
 Omegnight#7081: It's crazy you had time to implement a leaderboard !
 Tonyl#1885: Is it okay to work on a game's backend that won't affect gameplay like implementing a profanity filter for the leaderboards?
 shenalkm#1022: oh nice
 LemonScripts#5768: Okay
 Indigu#6862: Push the dice and Saikoro side roll. Both similar puzzle games but ones 3d and the other is 2d
 Mat S#0220: yes
 LemonScripts#5768: Is your name on itch crazypo just to make sure
 Catralitos#4674: ah ok then I forgot the stream from last year. hopefully I make it on. I didn't like my submission last year, but am very confident this year we made a fun game.
 Mark Brown#6982: There is no Google Form. Nothing has been announced for streaming yet
 Frederico Squashi#9311: That's nice, thanks!
 Mat S#0220: thank a lot ! dont hesitate to make real feedback even if ther're some negative points
 Mark Brown#6982: i do random games to give everyone a chance
 Lyfe#8258: are the streams gonna be archived?
 Mark Brown#6982: yes i will stream. not just the top 100 - i've never streamed the top 100!
 dardasaba#9759: He said he will, more details soon
 Catralitos#4674: I'm pretty sure it's just the top 100
 DavidF#3965: Will Mark stream playing games like last year?
If so where is the list that I can add my game to?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: If you've found other people's games that you thought were really interesting or cool feel free to mention their name etc
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: I didn't have music or sound effects, I put yes
Because both options weren't correct
Is that ok? Or do I need to change it
 Lyfe#8258: one of the best ones i played yesterday was youre a DM checking that a bunch of character sheets were legit
 krisis in a jar#0904: Send me your games so i can rate them! I'll be putting them in a list so i can play them after a break.
 LemonScripts#5768: Ill check it out
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: no but in future I would say yes for that
 Feesh#2467: is that the whole title
 Mat S#0220: fudge the dice you have to cheat against a D&D master
 Jasper#7906: I had it on "yes, I made all the music" earlier, but changed it to "no, all the music was made by other people", though both are true 😉
 LemonScripts#5768: What's your game
 theChief#0001: no 🙂 that's just to give people an idea about what was done during the jam!
 Mat S#0220: yeah I could have put a web version but I didn't think it had so much impact ^^ but yes good to know for next time 🙂
 Falcon#3043: hey if your game doesnt have music does it matter if you chose you made your own music or didnt make?
 qxt2019#6669: True
 Jasper#7906: Leaving old-school reviews should still work, and provide feedback, which is more important than the score in the jam at the end of the day
 Frederico Squashi#9311: Which engine did you used? I guess most engines have an HTML exporter, right? But for the next time you know it 🙂
 Mat S#0220: yeah I understand of course but it's frustrating ^^ especially since I feel like my game is interesting
 Feesh#2467: i was wondering why there's no ratings even tho theres a queue feature and everything
 Mark Brown#6982: we're not interested in banning people over tiny infractions, and will work with you to get within the rules before removing you
 qxt2019#6669: Im sorry to tell you but it doesnt look like you submitted it to the jam
 Coffe#5594: yeah that's why nobody is playing it ):
 Feesh#2467: yeah its not in the jam XD
 Frederico Squashi#9311: Tbh I only play HTML builds but I'm also a mac user, I think HTML builds are the best way to showcase your game to a wider audience
 ThatIsANoNoWord#5311:  uh... sorry dude but you didn't submit it in the jam. I'll leave a comment tho
 krisis in a jar#0904: Thank you for the answer! ^^
 Mark Brown#6982: No
 Lascif#0184: I see, I've made theChief aware of one person that has used iframes to load the game from their own website. I could easily create a way to check all submissions for iframes if you as moderators wanted to find out exactly who is doing that and then use your own discretion.
 krisis in a jar#0904: If a game doens't have a version for my system and the developer sends me a version with NO changes to the one submitted for my system, can that game get disqualified?
 Mat S#0220: I have the feeling that many people don't play my game because it is not available in the browser 😦
 LTCat#9725: that's my game and I can ensure that there are only language differences between the two versions... No adjustments have been made except that the Jam page is in Chinese and the English version is linked separately :(
 Jolly Ask#0856: just playing through people's entries, it's always so cool how many different Unique Mechanics there are out there waiting to be thought of
 nut dealer#1157: ofkendiaisj
 Coffe#5594: done
 dardasaba#9759: I found a couple of barely-rated games that were really good, don't remember names sadly
 Frederico Squashi#9311: Same for me haha
 Mark Brown#6982: we don't have a specific rule against that, so no - but if it comes to light that anyone is doing this in a clearly cheating way, then yes
 ThatIsANoNoWord#5311: Link your game in your profile so we can play it!
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I found a cool game called DICODED by ariake81. Its a sort of puzzle with a simple mechanic and could be a really chill game that looks great. I really enjoyed it
 Coffe#5594: I posted it in 
 Feesh#2467: damn man link your game i'll play it :v
 Lascif#0184: Will you be disqualifying anybody that uses iframes for their submission just in case they have edited it? 🤔
 qxt2019#6669: Dm it to me, you aswell 
 Manuel4o5#1038: What's your games name?
 Frederico Squashi#9311: Yeah, not sure if I'm allowed to post them here haha
 Hemera#2002: what's your game?
 Coffe#5594: if it makes you feel better ours has zero x)
 Mark Brown#6982: thanks - ultimately we can't check every single game, but once the top 100 are in, any rule breakers will be disqualified to make room for people who followed the brief
 Hemera#2002: sadly, our game has 4 ratings, at which point you basically cannot find it via any sorting... 😔
 LOPSTERu#3902: You can see a lot of the games that have links to outside builds just by sorting by least rated
 dardasaba#9759: Me too, mine's #38th most rated!
Pretty insane
 Spico#6316: i think im deep into the commenter games i have been exploring here for a while
all these games dont have too much ratings too its quite sad
 qxt2019#6669: What if i accidentally dm you my game :)
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yeah we do encourage playing some of the low rated games, its nice to get everything to at least 1 as quickly as possible
 Feesh#2467: you found any hidden gems?
 Frederico Squashi#9311: I usually sort for lowest rating, only at the end I look at the most rated games
 Frederico Squashi#9311: I got 7 ratings but only 5 people played it. Is it common for people to rate your game without actually playing it? 😄
 Mark Brown#6982: feel free to DM games that don't follow the rules to me
 Feesh#2467: i think a lot of people will go to most rated to play games tho so i dunno
 Manuel4o5#1038: Wow I just look at the top most rated games and mine is on top 40. Thank you to everyone that played and rated Bet Brawl, and I especially thank those who left feedback. I'm going to start playing jam entires tomorrow since I got some business at the moment.
Congrats to everyone that finished their games and good luck with the ratings.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: update: i just realized that you can change your minds on ratings.
 Cheese#8160: I saw an entry that had a Chinese build of the game and a separate English build of the game on a different itch game page
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: lmao
 LTCat#9725: thanks, it seems fair enough :D
 Feesh#2467: hahahaaha
 Jasper#7906: Better not do that, then, don't want to ruin the experience by making it too easy 😉
 BlankSlate#8922: Also I assume games that get lots of ratings are generally popular so usually get higher ratings
 BurgerWizard#8683: I tried doing that, and I found out I have really bad artistic skills
 Falcon#3043: right
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: hint for my game: if you rate all 5 stars on every category you get infinite life and a combination of rocket launcher and plasma beam
 theChief#0001: the more ratings you get, the more your score will average out to be what it actually deservers. That means games with fewer, higher ratings will probably do better
__however__ if you get fewer ratings than the median amount of ratings, itch will lower your score. That tends to be around 20, judging by previous jams
 Mark Brown#6982: Well not "whatever" - you can't link to an outside build of the game
 Falcon#3043: no you can add whatever
 Mark Brown#6982: No, of course not!
 Feesh#2467: maybe a showcase of one character then the title of your game
 ⃟pu  ⃟rp  ⃟le  ⃟#1529: does the theme this year feel a little bit specific?most games i play use literal dice
 Woahsea#4308: adding a hint on itch description won't get me disqualified, right?
 BurgerWizard#8683: 😂
 Mark Brown#6982: We did everything we could during the jam - there's clear instructions on the submit page and the jam rules and on this Discord. I'm sorry you didn't get it right, but we are not having any late submissions this year. I hope you enjoyed making the game, nonetheless!
 Maxy#9186: My friend really just put the sprites he made for the game into a picture and made it look like part of a level 😅
 theChief#0001: that's right, we can't make exceptions sorry!!
 LTCat#9725: And I'm curious about how much influence does the number of ratings have in the evaluation. First time to join a gamejam in itch =. =
 Coffe#5594: mkay the mods can't do anything?
 theChief#0001: that's not the fault of the crash, that's just bad UX on itch's part - that's how it works for every jam, sorry!
 BurgerWizard#8683: Guys, do you have any suggestions of how to make a thumbnail for my game?
 Falcon#3043: I forgor to do that last year
 theChief#0001: yeah that doesn't link the game to the jam
 Coffe#5594: I thought I created the whole page from inside the 'submit game' button. But I'm not really sure what happened
 Mark Brown#6982: Did you go back to the jam page and submit the uploaded file to the jam itself?
 Coffe#5594: the game and the page are up, but they aren't a 'part of the jam'
 Falcon#3043: :O
 Redline#7370: ah hi my favourite mark
 Mark Brown#6982: I can only recommend contacting Itch.io technical support if you believe their servers broke your game
 Falcon#3043: i ve seen one where the only thing working was the menu with some cool music and nice graphic but if you tried to play it nothing worked
 Spico#6316: i attached a gif to mine, hope it brings some attraction
 Coffe#5594: apparently my submission didn't work last because of server issues or something? The game files were still uploaded before the deadline so I'm wondering if the mods can do anything about it
 Maxy#9186: So people can at least see the game before dling
 Redline#7370: try mine if you haven't 😉 (check my profile there's a link there)
 adrenalyzed#5024: i have school tomorrow so im heading off gl with all ur games
 Maxy#9186: I got the nice tip of attaching a video as a comment to the game. Seemed like a good idea to me.
 LTCat#9725: some games are even not playable for me but comments says "Cool game! I love the graphics!"
urr confused
 Spico#6316: they are yeah, but some are browser ones too
 Falcon#3043: yeah
 Relis#1309: most of them are downloadable build only probably, like mine 😦
 Spico#6316: its really depressing that so manu games don't get attraction for some reason, i am going through the karma sorting and there are some genuine bangers out there
 Maxy#9186: Given the tight time frame, it's natural there are just things that's not gonna work welll, but the overall game should at least be playable : p
 Menica Folden#4823: In my puzzle game, the gold medal is 3 mooves, the silver one 6, and the bronze is 500 😂
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: the thing is, i don’t know if feedback will be very useful for me this jam. I know exactly what my game is and who it’s for. I know the music and graphics are pretty nice but could be better, and i know we ran into time constraints
 Maxy#9186: Yeah,
Like I played one game were you could build a dungeon to have a bot run through it. It's a nice concept, but lacked a way to be strategic about it. The way you built the dungeon did not really matter, so I said it's a nice game, but it lacks strategy.
Other game looked nice but the fight system just did not work, so I just wrote "looks good, but I can't play it, the fighting doesn't work."
I think most people here honestly care about getting feedback, not about being mad at being critized.
 LOPSTERu#3902: what games are you playing?
 LTCat#9725: After I played these games, I'm thinking are they just randomly send these positive reviews so that their game can get exposure
 Toboter#5206: To be fair, if your game has developed a personality you probably deserve a noble prize 😉
 dhafo#4640: last year gmtk ran with minijam and i had like 3 gmtk comments and like 10 comments on minijam even tho gmtk had 24 ratings and minijam only 16 (the ratings on gmtk were all over the place from 1star to 5star but on minijam it was hovering consistently between 3-4 stars) so yeah idk if imma be like super rabid for ratings lol but i do want as much useful feedback as possible
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: in my comments i always try to highlight my favourite thing, some issues i had, and ways i'd personally think of improving the game further post-jam
 qxt2019#6669: Dm me your game pls
 Jasper#7906: Is it though? It's just like "you.... eh... have a great personality!"
 Falcon#3043: im kind of scared people will go to mine submission and give a bad review so i just give the positive feedback
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: Compliment sandwich people. good thing-criticism-good thing
 qxt2019#6669: I turned in my phone and got jump scared by this
 dhafo#4640: u got a similar problem to mine i think but without reading
 ThatIsANoNoWord#5311: Maybe they want to seem positive so that the other person would rate their own game
 wzyanggg#5277: People are not blind, I think a lot of people come to jam just for fun, so why criticise?
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: I just watched a 2 hour long video about why ratings don’t matter. now I’m gonna go back to trying to farm itch ratings, cya
 Lascif#0184: It's good to be vocal about what you like about a game before being critical on how it can be improved imo
 OrangoMango#0973: I mean why there are 2 different comments sections?
 RedTeapot#1960: Yeah, I think you get to master your game while making it so you need to compensate for that
 LTCat#9725: It's quite strange that people always pick only tiny good things in comment and ignore these major bad ones...
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: The average game jam entrant 🐍
 Digitaldude555#5515: if you tear a game apart you are vulnerable to people getting back at you.
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: my game is either a 1 or 5 for fun depending on if you like reading
 wzyanggg#5277: fPositive comments may just be a kind of encouragement...
 adrenalyzed#5024: most people just give a good comment for the sake of giving one; if a game doesnt have any criticism in the comments, usually its an average game unless its actually perfect
dont be quick to judge tho
 Digitaldude555#5515: every jam is like this.
 NalaFala38290#9305: my game is too easy to me but one comment said it was challenging
 theChief#0001: yeah that's what I'd do too lol. Personally I think my game sits at around 3 for fun - which is a shame, because I love the concept
 Maxy#9186: Though I mean, even if it's easy, it could still be fun
 OrangoMango#0973: ok
 adrenalyzed#5024: oh alr
 LTCat#9725: yep... I've found many games with very positive comments, but after I played it I gave it 2 stars...
 theChief#0001: nope! It will actually even be later than that, the scores aren't released until mark's video 🙂
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: Once
 OrangoMango#0973: did Mark Brown make a game?
 Maxy#9186: If it's too easy, I enjoy it less, so that'd be a lower enjoyment score for me, personally
 adrenalyzed#5024: is there a way to find out your median rating before the jam ends or nah
 theChief#0001: presentation is overall look, feel and sound of the game, not the itch page!
 dhafo#4640: right, but also i kinda feel guilty about 5 staring enjoyment or creativity if there's no real WOW factor u know, i guess i can always go back and change it
 OrangoMango#0973: presentation goes to the itch.io page right?
 adrenalyzed#5024: very true
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: be careful about looking at analytics - yesterday i thought i had no people rate my games, what the analytics tab thinks of as "ratings" is the general ratings on itch and not the game's ratings on the jam
 Maxy#9186: I think given that it's a 48 hour jam, I don't really want to disadvantage people just because their game has "minimal balance issues". Getting something out there in 48 hours that is genuinely fun to play by itself is already a great feat
 dhafo#4640: but like it's a jam so idk, at the same time, i've played tons of jam games that i'd be like WOW POG GAMEPLAY so i kind of want to save it for that
 adrenalyzed#5024: i only give 5 stars when that part of the game actually made me go "wow" irl
 Cheese#8160: It'd have to be seriously awful for me to even consider rating below 3 tbh.
 JohaM#1085: Awesome thanks!:)
 dhafo#4640: i'm thinking of 4 staring enjoyment cause i like the game but it has some minimal game balance issues
 JohaM#1085: Analytics from dashboard
Also, don't sugarcoat your comments too much, be realistic, previous years people were like _"I got 20 nice comments, incredible !"_ and then got like a 2.3 rating and were so disappointed
 theChief#0001: 5 stars is reserved for only the games that seriously wow me. I do not give 5 stars very often 😂
4 stars for games that do all the right things but just miss that "oomph"
3 for games that are ok and I have nothing much to say
2 for games that have issues that get in the way of what would otherwise be an interesting game
1 for something that doesn't work
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: dm me your game, i'll give it a shake!
 LTCat#9725: umm is the final rating based on the average score? How much influence does the number of ratings have in the evaluation?
 Maxy#9186: How do you even see those stats?
 JohaM#1085: Real good, those numbers are 5 and 3 for me
 NalaFala38290#9305: 39% of people who viewed my game played it
 Maxy#9186: Like I played a game that was just bullets shooting at you, but I actually enjoyed it, so I gave it 5 stars for enjoyment, for example
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: that's good for having just started out the rating week i think
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: speaking of my game has 35 views and 21 browser plays  :]
 Maxy#9186: I usually go "I like it, it feels nice" -> 5 star.
It's something, not good but it does the job -> 3 star
it's not there or bare minimum 1 star
 Woahsea#4308: maybe play another game or two. then come back and rate?
 Redline#7370: I'm *fair* with ratings
 theChief#0001: they track "times someone clicked the play button for a browser game" XD
 Indigu#6862: I'm generous with the ratings
 swarm#1128: its not in the spirit of the site to be so intrusive unlike commercial stores
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: no they also track browser plays
 Lascif#0184: And even then with webgl how would you know?
 JohaM#1085: Same, but of course I'd like to get more ratings and comments to see what I'm doing good and what bad
 dhafo#4640: how are u guys doing your rating system, im rating my first game and want to 5 star already 😭
 theChief#0001: all they can track is whether or not you clicked the download button, which isn't much of a barrier 😂
 adrenalyzed#5024: it shouldnt matter that much bc im much more focused on becoming better with game design instead of winning
 theChief#0001: if you get fewer than the median number of ratings (currently 4), itch lowers your score anyway - median ratings tends to be around 20-25 for GMTK jams
 Redline#7370: why doesn't itch have a system where it only allows you to vote after you played the game for at least a minute, or downloaded the game?
 theChief#0001: that's correct, yeah - it's definitely an honour system and there are definitely people who do that. It sucks, but it should even out with enough rates 🙂
 Omegnight#7081: But if one person decided to randomly put 1/1/1 on your game without playing it, and only your game, I don't think it's detected
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i take my time playing games i rate because everytime i play a game i absorb the design power inside the game and become just a little bit stronger. 🙂
 adrenalyzed#5024: good
 Omegnight#7081: But itch.io has systems against people who just speedrun votings I think
 adrenalyzed#5024: whoever actually does that ruins the main point of the jam
 JohaM#1085: I had someone rate my game without playing :D
 Catralitos#4674: Yeah. I always leave a comment too when rating.
 JohaM#1085: Nope, you do
 Lascif#0184: The whole system works on trust
 adrenalyzed#5024: is there a system that prevents people from just rating the game without playing it first or do u have to trust people
 Omegnight#7081: I don't know if the game name in the username really works for feedback, I see that more for "identification" so we know who made what
 JohaM#1085: Lmao true, everyone would just be hyping up their own game
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: ahh yeah you gotta wait! or just put the name of your itch/game in your nickname. wink wink
 theChief#0001: thems the rules
and if that rule in particular wasn't in place, this channel would be hell xD
 JohaM#1085: How dare they!?
 honiemun#0001: Oh, the humanity
 Lex#2782:  was advertising their game in here with a  link
 Omegnight#7081: they _\*gasp\*_ asked to play their game
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: what happened, someone say something bad?
 theChief#0001: thanks ❤️
please keep ratings to 
 Lex#2782: 
 Starch_Supreme#4835: hello
 domjanabi#9370: i hope people won't be offended that i don't play their games til the end 👀
 Bisleri#7876: hi
 Relis#1309: i'm at 6 right now and counting
 Starch_Supreme#4835: Can’t wait for the next game jam. 2020 is gonna be a great year! :D
 domjanabi#9370: sth like 20
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: 3 but I have a list of 10 to get to tonight a s then whatever else I see
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: @ mark brown tell us the theme for next year NOW
 Indigu#6862: Well if the ratings come with positive comments it's a good sign
 Redline#7370: so true
 Starch_Supreme#4835: Oh
 vide0gamer#5404: ive got two ratings
 paulpork#7383: Still not announce yet. Maybe wait till 5/2023 ?
 Lex#2782: Next year
 AlpalcaLad#2549: just let them believe
 Redline#7370: hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
 Indigu#6862: Who's gonna tell em?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: I just want people to play my game and tell me how awesome I am for making it honestly.
 AlpalcaLad#2549: yeah even just having people actually play your game is such a nice experience
 Starch_Supreme#4835: Guys when does the game jam start
 Hawkshaw#1364: Surely a game must have a minimum number of ratings by the end though?
 Strella#7815: honestly the main thing is getting constructive comments feels so nice, hearing someone else enjoyed what u made enough to want to spend their time thinking about ways it can improve feels amazing >w<
 Lascif#0184: It's all about what scores those people give you
 AlpalcaLad#2549: it really is great
 adrenalyzed#5024: oml
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i have 8 ratings
 Indigu#6862: Anyone seen "the greatest game ever" with 100+ ratings
 Lascif#0184: Thing is that's top 10-15% of ratings amount but not always best ratings
 AlpalcaLad#2549: ive done 24 apparently
 Static doodles#2251: Really enjoy the games so far
 Koolento#6688: you can check in the filter submissions tab btw
 Static doodles#2251: 6 so far
 Peewi#8572: 20. The longest I've spent on one is 30 minutes on one that's bascially an idle game
 adrenalyzed#5024: idk how to check but prob around 10-20
 Redline#7370: none yet, I was sleeping but now I want to make a video about the game
 Koolento#6688: how many games have you guys rated?
 adrenalyzed#5024: i hope mark says that when he does the video on the jam
 Indigu#6862: That was the most sophisticated "oogy boogy woogy" my brain has ever computed
 Stopa#6148: Oh yeah, sure. I meant middle of the answers here. People posted only numbers of around 8 or >20
 adrenalyzed#5024: ayo wat
 Peewi#8572: I have 7
 theChief#0001: actually, the median number of ratings is currently 4 - so you're probably in the top 10-15% 🙂
 Stopa#6148: Im in the middle with 16.
 Vuurknaller#7233: 1 lol
 adrenalyzed#5024: 42
 Static doodles#2251: Around 7
 paulpork#7383: 9 here
 Lascif#0184: 27 so far here 👍
 davidnjihiahere#6326: 8 so far
 JohaM#1085: 4
 Amelia-chan#4996: i got 23 last i checked
 OrangoMango#0973: how many rating do you all have?
 JohaM#1085: Ahh ok, thanks!
 Taccos#1054: so far the best game on the jam i had the time to play was demons gamble
 AlpalcaLad#2549: you can but you have to get through a queue of random games first before you can pick and choose ones (to stop you getting your friends to rate yours high)
 Amelia-chan#4996: you can but you have to go throug a random queue
 davidnjihiahere#6326: you can rate randomized games if you've not submitted. You don't get to rate games you want to play
 JohaM#1085: Enough ratings for what? I was under the impression that you cant even rate jam games if you haven't submitted your own
 davidnjihiahere#6326: good idea
 adrenalyzed#5024: i hope they thought of this when they were doing the system
 Peas_N_Carrots#0529: Sorry if this question has been answered but how long til we can upload a post jam build?
 Lascif#0184: How do we find out the "average rating"
 AlpalcaLad#2549: probably non jammers trying to get enough ratings
 JohaM#1085: I think someone rated my game without playing, since 4 people have rated and 3 played, is that a thing people do?
 RedcoatsRevolt (Adam)#1185: I reviewed and played a bunch and will do some more after work
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: i gonna make a trailer for my game !
 xqrd#4298: i got 7 ratings
 Koolento#6688: go review some other games, that way the creator and other people who view comments can see your game!
 adrenalyzed#5024: lmfao idk how either
prob bc i went on a game rating spree
 Michel#2879: lucky man out there
 RedcoatsRevolt (Adam)#1185: I'm at 1 rating so far. It's not much of a game but I'd love feedback.
 adrenalyzed#5024: i got 42 ratings
 Michel#2879: bro Why am I the exact same amount of ratings :D
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: Some designers have said the following about the concept of input randomness: "Oogy Boogy Woogy, Let's Do A Banana Slamma".
 adrenalyzed#5024: i forgot how to check
nvm found it
 RedcoatsRevolt (Adam)#1185: Hi. I'm Mark Brown. Oogy boogy woogy, let's do a banana slamma
 Omegnight#7081: I was at 8 this morning but haven't checked since
 Woahsea#4308: I got 24
 Redline#7370: how many ratings have you guys got already? I'm at 18
 Omegnight#7081: **Especially** if Mark says oogy boogy woogy, let's do a banana slamma
 RVcord#2222: gg
 SharpLoaded#3832: ah, makes sense. Thanks!
 theChief#0001: Yeah it's a like/upvote system ☺️
 domjanabi#9370: how many likes a comment got i believe
 SharpLoaded#3832: What does the (+X) mean after names on itch? Some kind of karma thing? Or is it related to the jam specifically?
 Mark Brown#6982: even if i say oogy boogy woogy, let's do a banana slamma
 FredsMeds87#3239: Agreed!
 wzyanggg#5277: Seems you can, but the game file is locked.
 RedSantar#0027: can i edit my itch io project without affect the game jam version?
 wzyanggg#5277: In the last several mins of uploading, I was in a harry and I uploaded my last ludum dare game(WebGL) by mistake, and then I uploaded the right game(WindowsBuild). After I woke up, the wrong game have many ratings and the right game have none.🥲
 dhafo#4640: i think i listened to deus ex soundtrack too much while jamming
 theChief#0001: No, uploads are locked and we can't make exceptions. Sorry!
 RedSantar#0027: my game is played via browser but some people are reporting performances issues, can i upload a executable version?
 AJM-03#3713: Thanks
 wzyanggg#5277: thanks guys!
 adrenalyzed#5024: a week
 AJM-03#3713: How long do we get for voting?
 BluEagle#4805: i can't rememember which ones are missing lol
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: there are, they've been pruned cause we're not in the process of makign games for the jam anymore
 adrenalyzed#5024: there are less
 BluEagle#4805: is it me, or are there less channels?
 adrenalyzed#5024: if you comment on someones game it shows what u submitted
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: there's a karma system, yes. there's just a lot of other games
 wzyanggg#5277: Since my game is window version, Are there someway to add exposure?  for example, in ludum dare I can rate many other people's game and write something on the mainpage to get exposure , but in GMTK rating other peoples game seems not effective
 Santia#2861: also it is me, I had no time to test Sadge
 xqrd#4298: i was going to change the point system but i had to go somewhere so i dint have time to change it before submittions closed
 adrenalyzed#5024: yup
 Santia#2861: I think the next 24h will just be "oh wait, that's not supposed to be like this" for everyone who had no time to test lol
 adrenalyzed#5024: i forgot to make the game freeze when you die you you can keep playing except you cant see your player or enemies lol
 wzyanggg#5277: Compared to game that have a web version, only a few people rate my game😫
 wzyanggg#5277: Web version have a bug ,so I build the windows version rather than the Web Version at the last few mins of uploading
 Santia#2861: But hey free playtesting from gamejam people lets goooo
 Santia#2861: there is like a 6% chance that you can only complete the second level if you know how to exploit a mechanic because of random effects...whoops
 dhafo#4640: it will be me
 Santia#2861: I just realized extremely low chance scenarios that might be a problem in our game but I hope no one has that much bad luck in our RNG rolls lmao
 Menica Folden#4823: it is actually hard to read Mark messages without hearing it with his voice
 GamesOgre#4710: "Due to a lack of hands, this enemy's spellcasting focus is actually held between its buttocks"
 dhafo#4640: just explain it with lore ez
 GamesOgre#4710: "Baka don't look at me" kinda feels
 Santia#2861: thats sick lol
 Spico#6316: damn lets go on a roll then
badumts
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: for download games there's potentially stuff like displaying at the wrong resolution and borking my window setup, and crashing my graphics driver (which always takes unity editor with it), et.c. et.c.
 Lascif#0184: Web games also usually mean it runs fine on mobile devices. I can literally play my game on my phone or even the radio in my car.
 GamesOgre#4710: Mood, ended up with an enemy that has an inverted facing during movement
 Santia#2861: working in a team has huge ups but also decently sized downs, however I work 3D only and doing that alone in 48h is haaard
Also yea lack of sleep hit everyone, it's rough lol
 Omniclause#4760: There are filtering options on the left hand side if the page. Karma shows people who have rated the most games at the top
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: yeah i usually stick to web games
 dhafo#4640: it was a solo act here but my brain was slow af at that point, didnt sleep lol
 skejeton#5788: true, that's why my topmost priority for gamejams (and even non game related jams) is getting stuff appear in the browser
 leddoo#7601: makes a lot of sense, i think. 1) fewer clicks. 2) not having to trust some rando's code, because OSs can't do security.
I will eternally be mad about it but our team already decided to continue work on this concept with a new cleaned up project
 Fusoy#6101: From an ecologic point of view, I feel like devs should delete unused assets, even if it's annoying. 1 GB of unused assets downloaded by millions of people for the biggest games is a lot
 Spico#6316: what's a karma filter? i think ill do that too actuall
 dhafo#4640: last 10 mins was me fixing something i broke LOL
 skejeton#5788: looks like browser games are more popular compared to PC versions, because if you take a look at "in need of rating" tab most of them are windows exe's
 Omniclause#4760: I personally like to filter by most karma. If a game has very few to no ratings but they haven’t rated any/many games I don’t really feel bad for them. It’s the people who are actively rating and giving back to the community and not getting ratings in return that I feel bad for.
 S4B3R#9060: I did all the art for my game because the artist was sick 😭 I'm meant to be a musician lmao
 Toboter#5206: It's impossible to predict, since code can just load assets. And code is mathematically impossible to predict.
 Santia#2861: The last 10mins before starting upload were just me in a panic trying to delete as many unused big assets as possible, we had a lot of stuff to scrap sadly
 leddoo#7601: if you can load by string from c++, they can't really do anything else.
they can't know what the code will do .
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: yeah figuring out when assets will never be used in a real game project is a hard problem and one usually left to the developers
 domjanabi#9370: bruh moment
 Santia#2861: Yes if your asset is unused but in the project, it will get packaged afaik (I am not 100% on this as I don't do a lot of shipping mode builds)
 Lascif#0184: Does Unreal still build assets you don't even use?
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: use a slightly different high-res font for every letter. give me 8k textures
 Santia#2861: people don't clean up their unused assets, specifically the free starter content is huge for stuff you will definitely not use. Also the default settings are not great for file size
 domjanabi#9370: i was thinking it might be unreal engine but i'm quite surprised it actually is
how does it get to that point tho?
isn't it because of massive assets?
 Digitaldude555#5515: does unreal have web builds and stuff?
 dhafo#4640: the unreal engine builds 😓 yeah that might be the hardest way to get ratings
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: all games should be at the 1gb itch limit, else i feel they're holding out on me
 Digitaldude555#5515: why are unreal games so huge??
 krisis in a jar#0904: Send me yall's games and play so I can rate them, I just woke up lol
 Toboter#5206: My WebGL build is 8Mb lol.
 Lascif#0184: Unreal Engine most likely. I had somebody link me their game that size so it'll take a while to download it.
 Santia#2861: *looks at my file size being 420mb* ehhh...Unreal Engine and no time to optimize filesize😭
 Toboter#5206: Probably 4k textures or something.
 Hemera#2002: true that...
 Spico#6316: im just kinda stressed about it ;^;
 domjanabi#9370: i saw a game with a 422mb download lmao _HOW_
 Santia#2861: if your game is good and discoverable at all it will have a chance to snowball too through word of mouth. it is the first day, and it is a monday on a time where all timezones should be busy with something right now. the voting time is all week, take it easy
 Lascif#0184: DM'd to theChief to save you the DM
 Toboter#5206: They probably have some following already.
 Omniclause#4760: My game uses a wav file I found that reducing the sample rate fixed the issue with very little difference in perceivable quality. Input lag was a whole other issue though
 Galactum#6235: i dont know lol its been like half a day
 Spico#6316: i think in 3-4 votes the game enters a wave of obscurity i havent seen any other games with such votes anywhere so far
 theChief#0001: no sorry only uncool mark is here, cool mark is on holiday
 Hemera#2002: oh wow! our game only has 4 ratings so far, how would one even get so many ratings that quickly
 domjanabi#9370: how cool mark is here
 Galactum#6235: ohh crap thanks for reminding me that i was supposed to add post processing but i forgot to lol
 Mark Brown#6982: This will only lead to the game being disqualified, so it's not very smart 😛
 theChief#0001: have you got a link? DM it to me or another mod/mod helper and we'll take a look
 Toboter#5206: Tbh, only thing you need to do for pixel art is turn the scaling mode to Point for every bloody Asset.
 Spico#6316: i kinda distaste that the games with more ratings get pushed foward more than around 20 or so votes, it creates a snowball effect on the games that get tested before any other
 Mark Brown#6982: We do ask that what you submitted during the jam, is what stays to be judged during the voting period, please!
 Lascif#0184: Something I did notice is that somebody made their game run via an external website so it allows for them to update and fix it still even though the deadline is over 👀
 Julien#2204: How the duck so people get to these numbers? Wow
 Hemera#2002: ohhh!
 domjanabi#9370: also having a cover image and screenshots is probably a good idea, especially when you have a nice artstyle.
i'm like 10x as likely to click on a game if it has a pretty image, though i saw people abuse this too by making their game seem like something it's not
 Galactum#6235: woah Roll N Skate got 464 ratings?? damn must be a good game then
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: One for an  ruling I think - normally no changes are allowed to any part of your game, but something that's likely to be exploited/become offensive might be a bit of a grey area.
 Julien#2204: I almost exclusively play low rated games for the first few days
 Galactum#6235: yeah, but you can see how many ratings each game got
 theChief#0001:  post processing is love, post processing is life. I always crank the bloom up, I've pretty much got a signature visual style now lol - simple shapes and lots of bloom
 Toboter#5206: No ratings are visible till Sunday.
 dhafo#4640: my game might have worked better in 3d tbh
 Spico#6316: i would at least recommend that we rate lesser rated games, sure you can find 1 or 2 rated ones but around 3 rated games are pretty much gone in obscurity
 Galactum#6235: also please play the low ratings games, i found one of my favorite games so far in that section
 krisis in a jar#0904: Good morning
 Hemera#2002: where can one see which games are lower rated? 🤔
 Relis#1309: well if it's of any consolation, i had all the time to do it but i'm dumb and didn't 😂
 theChief#0001: I usually work in 2D too 😂 post processing can still push it over the edge. But yeah audio is a nightmare lol
 Galactum#6235: honestly just choosing a random game from the poorly rated section, playing it, and then choosing a game from the "Submitted" section of someone's comment and repeating
 Spico#6316: go into lesser voted games, rate people that replied to my game generally
 Digitaldude555#5515: I used post processing for the first time in my life....mah gawd its a game changer
 dhafo#4640: so far i have a list of people in discord to rate lol, after i will rate comments, then i guess i'll look at the submission page
 Toboter#5206: I certainly wanna try just making a game in native WebGL at some point, but have no clue how.
 nubert#9512: just in the queue
 theChief#0001: this is true! But you'll get plenty of people playing without 🙂 and if there are issues with your webGL version, that is _all_ people will talk about
 Galactum#6235: how are you guys going about finding games to rate?
 Tonyl#1885: Hey! Do you think it's okay for me to work on the backend? To be more specific, implement a profanity filter for the leaderboards.
 Spico#6316: maybe i should offer a gif of the gamrplay on the game page that could help
 dhafo#4640: hey if they make a game for the first time it's worth i think
 Toboter#5206: Well, my game was 2D, so it didn't matter much. But I did have to replace a WAV file with an MP3 file, since that just didn't work randomly.
 Julien#2204: I wish I had the time to make a webGL build. Yeah unity's webgl sucks, but I feel like more people are willing to check out the game if they don't have to download stuff
 Santia#2861: if you believe in your core concept keep working on it regardless. Gamejam builds don't reflect the full potential of an idea, it just presents a slice of it. It would suck if not a lot of people see it but it's a real chance ya gotta live with. If you have a good page and a nice cover people will click it out of sheer curiosity eventually
 theChief#0001: feedback! It is SO difficult to find playtesters and get good, valuable feedback. Some people also think it's a good marketing idea (it's not - game devs probably aren't your target market)
 Space#0859: Also... Alot of people changed it a bit... They changed "roll" into "role" and then you are the dice
 BlankSlate#8922: I don't get people who submit games that were obviously not made for the jam like what do you gain from this
 theChief#0001:  please.
 Spico#6316: whether ill update it or not will depend on whether the games liked or not, i am really passionate about it and proud that finally after a year i got a first release but it still kinda succ that it may not get viewed alot
 dhafo#4640: LOL i just realized i have screenshots from my placeholder art, the difference is hilarious
 Ngai Chi Sze To (Jack)#4852: looks like a cool engine, first time heard this
 R2D2Vader#0693: 👀
 domjanabi#9370: yeah in hindsight i should've prepared too and made it a web build instead
 Space#0859: Theres one "my high-school crush" it's not even there game... Its nothing to do with the game jam... Just a random gane they submitted made by someone
 theChief#0001: I tend not to do web builds because of all of the massive, massive flaws with it in Unity.
- hardware acceleration is disabled by default in most browsers, so performance can be _really_ poor. I use a lot of post processing, so the game would really suffer for it
- no compute shaders, which means no VFX graph. Doesn't always affect me, but when it does it hurts xD
- a bunch of awful, terrible, no good bugs
 Spico#6316: i guess so, i really wish i knew that sooner maybe i could have gotten a web version working with godot
but since there are so many games out there downloading each of them would be tidious
 Santia#2861: don't focus on the rating much. Give yourself a decent chance of having a discoverable game and then just be glad you managed to create a project like this in 48h
 R2D2Vader#0693: my only issue with playing on web is that chromium hates my game for some reason, it literally lags in chrome and edge but plays fine on firefox
 Toboter#5206: Well, what do you expect from 20k random people 😉
 dhafo#4640: i plan on going through a big rating binge soon lol
 domjanabi#9370: i took a look at the unrated submissions section and _all_ of them are downloads.
people really don't like to download games ig 🙄
 Spico#6316: alot of submissions this year, literally my first game jam im quite scared
 Falcon#3043: i think i just played a submission made in scratch
 R2D2Vader#0693: haha mine was totally wack
 Santia#2861: I only played download games so far and had a great time
 Space#0859: Tbh... Some of these games are amazing... But some are totally wack💀
 dhafo#4640: well if it has a few comments shouldnt be too bad right
 Omniclause#4760: I totally get that people are into the convenience but I very begrudgingly put mine up as WebGL builds. I went a couple jams where I decided to go download only and the play count just went down so much but I hate how differently the game plays in WebGL versus downloadable. I will say in a lot of cases some of the better games are download only and it’s worth the time to give them some love. If you use the itch app downloading and uninstalling is super easy without ever opening the file explorer.
 Toboter#5206: Btw, does anyone know what language WebAssembly is usually compiled from?
 Shimp#0064: Wait, there is construct 3 now??? I used it when i was a kid, but it was construct 1 and 2
 domjanabi#9370: true
 Spico#6316: the player character is very much visible and in the center
 Toboter#5206: Only has to go wrong once
 Menica Folden#4823: (It's another reason why Construct 3 is great for game jams, it's created with web tools !)
 domjanabi#9370: i downloaded probably 20+ games already and nothing bad happened so far
 absolutelyivy#3850: cover art tip: make your text as BIG AS POSSIBLE or put a face in it, the human brain notices those much faster than other art
 Spico#6316: i think im gonna go on a trip on rating the lower rated games
 Lascif#0184: I remember the pain last year of just trying to get it working in the web browser. It was horrible.
 Toboter#5206: The compression settings are usually the cause. So much so they made a note about it in the submission page this year.
 Spico#6316: cant do web version wish i knew that sooner, the logo is very good thanks to a friend of mine, i guess all i can do is comment on others games
 Lascif#0184: What I do with download only ones is run them in a Virtual Machine so people still get their game played but it's still done securely for me
 Woahsea#4308: I know im just overly cautious
 dhafo#4640: what usually works is web build if possible, gif or nice art for your cover/logo, and comment on other people's games, AND have screenshots for ur game as well
 domjanabi#9370: try them out and leave comments lol
 Kritical#4329: your pc will be fine(mostly)
 Acu1000#5560: Make a good thumbnail, use the  channel, maybe get a streamer to play if you're able to
 theChief#0001: this is reasonable, but generally scams and viruses don't do anything with their page - or if they do, they do very little. It tends to be pretty easy to spot a bad actor. This is actually intentional on their part! They don't want people who do their due diligence, that would actively hurt them. They want the people that _don't_ check things like this!
This is actually why the nigerian prince scam emails have so many typos and weird language. It's incredibly well-calculated!
 dhafo#4640: i think it was some plugin i used that screwed it up
 Menica Folden#4823: This should be the focus of not web-based engine tbh, it's madening that sometines Unity games don't work on the web out of the box
 Woahsea#4308: so many of the games with little ratings don't have browser versions and feel bad not playing them as I don't wanna risk damage to my pc
 Spico#6316: any recommendations on how to advertise your game so it reaches more hands? I am thinking about trying out other jammers games but im unsure how that's gonna work out
 Gman#6328: Hey people! anyone wanna do a game rating vs game rating?
 Acu1000#5560: LEAVE ME ALONE
 dhafo#4640: my webgl build ended up being impossible 😭
 Toboter#5206: Yes, I shall win a Sub-Total Of Prizes 😉
 Acu1000#5560: Well you should've seen all the people suffering while trying to make a working web build
 Santia#2861: I only did like 5 I think but damn I enjoyed something about each so far
 Omniclause#4760: Totally get that. Like 75 percent of my comments have said my player controller is to slippery
 Toboter#5206: So far I had two guys complaining it didn't work, two guys replying it did, and two guys saying it's neat.
 Eliane#2931: I've rated and commented 25 games so far. Time for a little break
 Acu1000#5560: STOP
 dhafo#4640: the game is like pushing/flipping 6 sided dice but with parts of words on each face, and u have to push them together to make words, but it's hard to make decent designed puzzles by urself lolol
 Menica Folden#4823: Something I am grateful for is that each year, more games are available in browser. I never liked downloading many .exe without knowing what's inside
 Toboter#5206: An open fire is sure to get you some hot ratings 😉
 theChief#0001: if it was, you'd know 🙂
 dhafo#4640: i am very much scared that it is annoying LOL
 theChief#0001: by contrast, everyone complains about my gameplay 😉 I'd rather be in your position!
 Acu1000#5560: open fire
 theChief#0001: if there's something wrong with it, people **__will__** comment 😂 gameplay doesn't have to be outstanding, it just has to be not annoying 🙂
 Santia#2861: I just try to comment on the general ideas or something that stands out
 dhafo#4640: one thing i'm worried about, so far people seem to only mention the visuals and nothing really about the gameplay
 BlankSlate#8922: My biggest fear when commenting is someone misinterpreting my comment
 Julien#2204: Oh people do that? I'm gonna check Twitch
 Santia#2861: I'm glad that most of the games I checked so far were pretty cool
 dhafo#4640: if i'm still awake in the next 30 maybe i'll actually ditch the nap for now 😭
 Toboter#5206: Cease the means of game production? That'll just give you better Marx.
 dhafo#4640: same tbh i was worried about what people thought about the gameplay but seems like the 2 comments i got so far were super positive
 Acu1000#5560: cease
 Toboter#5206: Also, it'll give your game better Marks 😉
 RomketMan#0055: I also love seeing people livestream their rating sessions, get to see their experience through the game and their immediate reactions 😀
 Lascif#0184: Yeah, I leave a comment on everything I rate. Usually I talk about what I like, what I don't like and anything I think that could be added or improved 🙂
 theChief#0001: I actually spend at least 20 minutes per game, writing a big chunk of feedback and sending a gameplay video! I prefer fewer, better comments.
Also, you can be completely selfish with it if you need that justification 😉 leaving a comment puts your game underneath the comment, and better feedback will encourage other people to give _you_ better feedback in return!
 Eliane#2931: I always leave a comment, because as a submitter, that's what I like the most ! Reading what people think of my game, what could be improved, what was a success, this is really the best when it comes to game jams !
 Kritical#4329: i am gonna go and play random submissions now
 Toboter#5206: I haven't rated many yet, was way  too tired.
 Acu1000#5560: People appreciate those comments though
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: You're more than that! You're a few quid a month on Patreon too!
 Yolwoocle#6689: Laws of physics say you're just maths 😔
 Digitaldude555#5515: If I justed rated games and left no comments I would be at like 50 but writing comments takes a while
 dhafo#4640: sure dm me so i remember to check out after nap 😮
 Eliane#2931: I did ! If you want to try it ah ah
 davidnjihiahere#6326: thank you!
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: `Everyone on the internet is a bot`
 theChief#0001: it is, yeah! Edit game -> more -> admins
 davidnjihiahere#6326: oh nice
 Acu1000#5560: you can edit description and game page
 Ibra#8468: wasn't it landslide
 davidnjihiahere#6326: is it possible to add contributors to a project currently? I know it might be a little late
 Toboter#5206: Is it just fantasy?
Caught in the landscape,
Out of touch with reality?
 loogi#4810: Real life new york city
 Lascif#0184: What is this "real life"
 theChief#0001: am I just maths to you
 Lascif#0184: I simply shall not be perceived
 Toboter#5206: The inherent horror of being perceived on the internet.
 dhafo#4640: yes it's me
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: A joke game that didn't really work as a joke, that's all
 Mark Brown#6982: It's just better to not feed into the parasocial relationship hell of the internet
 theChief#0001: don't put game links in this channel please. 
 Acu1000#5560: what was it
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: Please don't spam other channels with self-promotion - if people want to find games to review, they'll use the appropriate channel for it
 Yolwoocle#6689: Is it because you're afraid it could go wrong after that 'MarkMarkMark' game from a while ago?
 theChief#0001: ah damn I forgot to do this - my template project has splash screens disabled, so it really does just throw you straight into the game with no menu or anything 
 Toboter#5206: But maybe you'll win someone's heart 🤔
 Space#0859: Me not even being in the jam so i dont even get a chance this year 😍💅
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592:  look at my game and read carfully
 Space#0859: Oh dam
 SAFT_Morlol#2702: Yes, but there is nothing you can win besides being in a GMTK Vid
 qxt2019#6669: And mark plays top 100
 Acu1000#5560: Top 100 games will be played by mark and 20 of them will be featured in video so you could say these are the ultimate winners
 Toboter#5206: Top 20 get in Marks Video.
 Space#0859: Question... In this game jam...is there like placements? Like a winner?
 Toboter#5206: Your pfp isn't a selfie per chance, is it? 😉
 dhafo#4640: i gotta start rating soon but im still in the post crunch coma prob gonna take another nap at any time soon
 Toboter#5206: Makes it easier to be better next time
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: unity has options to add extra splash screens to that animation, you could drop it straight in there
 SAFT_Morlol#2702: Basicly we could use it like the unity start animation
 Space#0859: So... Who else didn't make it?🥲
 dhafo#4640: i think i made an ok splash screen tho so it's fine
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: ahh i see. just that i saw someone straight up add your face in the game and the mods just. immediately shot it down
 Mark Brown#6982: you may use the gmtk logo, but we ask you not to make your game *about* gmtk, me, the mods etc
 Tornado#0975: i feel sad that my game probably hasnt turned out that good
 dhafo#4640: i just added it last year and it looked cool
 Peewi#8572: A logo was made available that you could include if you wanted to
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: wasn't that actually against the rules?
 Ibra#8468: no not at all, mark did provide the branding but it was up to you whether you want to
 qxt2019#6669: Were suposed to include a logo ?
 Peewi#8572: I've rated 17 games so far and none of them included the jam logo
 Toboter#5206: That's optional
 dhafo#4640: oh nyo i forgot to add the gmtk jam logo to my game didnt i
 Jamesor#6153: Hey I’m gonna be playing games later today so if anyone wants me to try their game just send in in my dms!
 vide0gamer#5404: i have no reviews and 1 comment saying that the game crashed
 Lascif#0184: They have to give 25 reviews to random games first to then review your game
 USER#8646: i dont think they can if they didnt participate
 Omniclause#4760: Damn haha. I’ve gotten a decent amount of positive feedback but a lot of people think my player movement is too slippery. Sucks to know I could’ve fixed that by just changing a number on a variable
 Straycat#1422: our team upload the new version of the game in last sec before the deadline... and the browser is not loading since then lol
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: oka
 Acu1000#5560: well that could be pretty unfair
 Amelia-chan#4996: non-submitters must go through a random queue of a few games before being able to rate specific ones
 Peewi#8572: Non-participants have to rate a number of randomly assigned games before they can rate games of their own choosing
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: can anyone rate? can I send the game to a friend to rate it?
 Relis#1309: mine has 2 reviews and 0 comments and i take it as "i tired it and don't have anything good to say" 😂
 USER#8646: mine has 3 comments and 10 reviews so i hope not
 Digitaldude555#5515: yes. sadly.
 Acu1000#5560: no, a lot of people just dont comment because only rating is quicker
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: idk
 Omniclause#4760: Is it a bad sign if your game has twice as many reviews as comments?
 Toboter#5206: Can't go wrong either way.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: hey the swedes are european. i think.
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: I have a little dog and I'm cuddling him right now and he has the "help me" face
 USER#8646: also in itch do you usually reply to all comments to thank the reviewer or should i only reply when I have something meaningful to say
 BadPiggy#5202: Oh yeah, that heatwave oof
 Toboter#5206: Nah, that had a frozen lake in it.
 Jasper#7906: Oh no, I'm having trouble finding some of the icons I used. Gotta dig deeper to be able to attribute properly!
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: because europe is currently busy doing a cosplay of dante's inferno
 BadPiggy#5202: After Tuesday ? Dang
 CRITZ#4946: Thank you !!
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: mark is going to stream the games too eventually, but that's after tuesday
 BadPiggy#5202: Markus Brownus
 Mark Brown#6982:  !
 Toboter#5206: The hoodie is mandatory though 😉
 CRITZ#4946: Anyone knows streamers who are going to play some GMTKjam games ?
 Lascif#0184: Whilst it would be nice to see our game do well on the jam we still think it'd be a decently fun game even if it doesn't exactly reach the top 100 or that. It just wants some more content and it'd be a full game. We've had people say they've played it for like 30 minutes to an hour which is great for game that only has an example of the gameplay. We alos have tons of ideas of where it can go.
 RomketMan#0055: Then reality hits when you grow up, and realise its really hard to grow a beard 🤣
 Michel#2879: I would like it cus I have an old prototype that matches the theme. Were things starts duplicating
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: this year's theme gave me an irrational hatred for King Dice, who makes me get into a rage every time i see him, and must murder on sight now
 Lascif#0184: last gamejam we had doggos fly across the screen in the thumbnail and people thought that was cute
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: well I will write that down for my jam
 Michel#2879: when I was a kid. I thought all programmers were fat boomers with long blonde beards (technically like notch)
 Toboter#5206: Too similar to "linked together" in 2020 (I think?)
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: mark usually pulls out the theme last minute
 theChief#0001: depends on the game I guess!
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: no it's only me
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: are we already thinking about next year's theme when this year's jam isn't even fully over
 Digitaldude555#5515: see how well it places first.
 USER#8646: such a dumb mistake should have found that
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: stupid idea:
make the next gmtk them "double"
 Lascif#0184: If you can keep it simple so it's just the logo and then some action behind it, it can look good imo
 Menica Folden#4823: ShareX is sooo great for that
 Aurélien#3461: maybe it's because there too many game ? when a posted my game, it take some time to load the cover
 theChief#0001: actually, screenshots/gifs of games don't tend to work very well as a thumbnail - they are often too busy!
 Lascif#0184: We're tempted to polish ours up a bit and fix some bugs and publish it on Steam. People seem to really like it and I think with some more time it'd be a semi-decent free steam game.
 Aurélien#3461: Aaaaaah zut alors !
 Lex#2782: Just woke up and got a ton of jam games to go through, if you want me to play your game send it to my dms
 S-Dev#8087: yes, I will optimize it a bit more, add tutorial, more polish, and probably upload it to google play
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: no he just didn't make it
 Lascif#0184: If you want an eyecatching thumbnail use ShareX or Gyazo Gif to record a segment of your game and save that as the thumbnail.
 Mark Brown#6982: is itch still not letting you upload covers?
 Toboter#5206: You know y'all have to review games yourself, right,
 USER#8646: ok thanks
 Digitaldude555#5515: as it is now, google play game.
 theChief#0001: no cover! Also I haven't really posted the link very many places
 Toboter#5206: Make a comment. That way people don't keep commenting about it, but don't necessarily see it at first.
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: Any game jam game worth its salt has a known bugs section on the itch page
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: when is the next feedback fest one is
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: how YOU a popular dicord mod helper have only 5 rates? That's only 1 after me
 Aurélien#3461: and underpay bots ?
 LOPSTERu#3902: Do you guys have any tips for making appealing thumbnails for your game because im kinda struggling with that lol
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: oki
 Toboter#5206: Coffee.
 USER#8646: should I let people know of the bug on itch or does it make my game look bad
 Aurélien#3461: how can a review so many games ?!
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: he means a jam that uploading early version works, not like in this jam
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: ok thanks
 Digitaldude555#5515: thats cool my first build was made 3 hours before deadline...
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: the bullet hell jam
 theChief#0001: I uploaded an early version for feedback
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: huh?
 theChief#0001: yeah I did do that this time xD
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: theChief's
 theChief#0001: I didn't invent this xD I copied it from smarter people than me 😉
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Is there a gamejam where you upload your in progress game and get feedback?
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: theChief caught inventing way to send link in general without sending link in general
 5fm#0001: going to rate games when I'm back from work
 USER#8646: oh ok nice i hope no one see's this
 Amelia-chan#4996: yes you can sorry I misunderstood
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: me with 4 👀
 ComputerCat#4565: except for the gif i have done everthing
 The Handsome  Cat#6115: rated  12 games
 Straycat#1422: good idea to do gif thumbnail, I'll try it too
 USER#8646: i mean after voting
 swarm#1128: I did a special thumbnail but i'm starting to wonder if it's too boring and I should put a screenshot of gameplay
 Omniclause#4760: Do whatever you can to make your page appealing. Thumbnail is most important and make sure you have at least one gif and 2 to 3 screenshots
 Ennio#4334: Thanks!
 MangoPango#6533: 2???bro I have 1 🤑
 Amelia-chan#4996: sorry, after the rating period yes
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: I want link to your game NOW before you change tumbnail
 Lascif#0184: Can you dm me your game?
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: only the game files are locked
 USER#8646: can i fix this after the jam ?
 theChief#0001: yep! I'm about to do mine 🙂
 Toboter#5206: Yes
 Kritical#4329: I have a lot of features then
 Ennio#4334: Guys are we allowed to edit the thumbnail and add screenshots after submitting the game?
 Lascif#0184: Tip - If you want an eyecatching thumbnail use ShareX or Gyazo Gif to record a segment of your game and save that as the thumbnail.
 USER#8646: so if you constantly add dice over the area even if its occupied the game thinks you used them
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: ok I don't think I wanna break my mouse so
 ComputerCat#4565: is there a way to get more people to come to my game
 Santia#2861: I have not found a crash in any game I played in this jam so we all have a 100% success rate by default to me
 Digitaldude555#5515: I need to learn how to make cover images.
 swarm#1128: as long as the game doesnt crash, it's a feature
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: Because your game suuuuu - _banned_
 Phallo#3476: one of my friends found out that in our game if you click at like 200+ times a second our characters attack will actually shoot them backwards through the walls 😂
 Fusoy#6101: I need to do an amazing thumbnail, I only have two ratings
 Digitaldude555#5515: what did I just read
 theChief#0001: don't worry about your ratings, I am a mod, I've done over 100 jams, I can perfectly predict all things game jam, and I've only got 4 ratings 😉
 dekaaspro#4965: what's the name?
 Santia#2861: same, we just really wanted to show off our deathscreen, it's a feature we swear
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: Bear in mind how many people missed Sunday evening for personal commitments and will be playing over lunch times/evenings/this coming weekend
 USER#8646: ```
func _on_BOX2_area_entered:
diceCount-=1
if not is2Occupied:
``` the variable reduction should have been inside the if statement
 Lascif#0184: If anybody would like their games reviewing and feedback feel free to send me a DM btw. I'll give it a go as soon as I can (If it's a download I'll add it to my queue as I won't be able to download until later) 👍 (Also I'd appreciate if you'd try my game 😉 )
 Michel#2879: I remember trying to make an erotic programming language.
It was called pornScript
I made the moan put it(input) commands and Added variables logic. But then got tired at the point of having to implement archimetic expressions. i think I'll get back to it tho
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: There is a week of rating time left. Part of it is networking. Find People who want to play games! Play games and leave a comment so they see your game and can play it!
 Omniclause#4760: What is the game? Mine is about cats too and I found another game with a main mechanic shockingly similar to mine. Both our games you roll a dice that gives you one of 3 different colored cats with different movement abilities
 swarm#1128: my bugs just add challenge to the game
 BadPiggy#5202: It's just the first day lol. Don't worry
 Santia#2861: the more obscure the bug, the better the chances no one will know
 USER#8646: lol you have to do something ver weird to activate it though
 Toboter#5206: It's really good for a few things, but pretty terrible for others because no OOP.
 Digitaldude555#5515: 30?? even though I got 12 right now seems impossible to get that many
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: you're late I already discovered 2 in mine
 Santia#2861: it's okay everyone got some jank
Our first jump is impossible if you don't sprint, which you don't get told how to do until you made 4 jumps lmaooo
 Lascif#0184: If you don't look directly at the bug, it's not there
 BadPiggy#5202: Don't tell anyone then kek
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: I remember a dude saying rust is a good choise for my first programming language
 USER#8646: noooooooo! i just discorvered a game breaking bug in my game :(
 Santia#2861: I'm glad I could be lazy and just use Unreal Blueprint to skip writing lots of code
 Madness#5032: Is there a way to see top-rated games right now?
 Toboter#5206: Assembly devs 😉
 Lascif#0184: It's almost like you have some kind of experience with hosting game jams before 🤔
 BadPiggy#5202: People who make their own engines and games in RUST tower over everyone else
 Santia#2861: those and custom engine coders
 dardasaba#9759: Ah
 Toboter#5206: People who make 3D Games in Scratch tower above all though.
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: pov: a costum engine user enters the chat
 theChief#0001: I said 4-6 was based on my gut feeling - and it turns out that I, once again, can predict everything about a jam perfectly 😉
 Santia#2861: I'll get into unity some year but this year is not that year
 Michel#2879:  this guy does best programming tutorials on youtube
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Made my first godot game for this game jam lol
 dardasaba#9759: Didn't you say the 4 was based on a gut feeling?
Also I just joined the conversation so I might have missed the context xD
 Relis#1309: so... i got two ratings and no comments. should i be worried? 😂
 absolutelyivy#3850: GODOT CHADS WHERE U ATTTTT
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: welp I started with unity I will continue with unity ~~because my laptop doesn't have any space~~ because I know a lot about unity
 Toboter#5206: Godot Chads get a seat too.
 theChief#0001: ... I did, it's 4
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Or were they talking about the number of ratings?
 dardasaba#9759: > it's pretty easy to write a script that goes through and calculates the median
DEW IT
 Santia#2861: Unreal Engine enjoyer 🤝 Unity is super sick though
 Michel#2879: Yeah you may need c# toturial then.
 S-Dev#8087: great! Thank you for playing it! it means a lot!
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: haha unity3d user
and I have the jam ID by the power of inspect element 😉
 Santia#2861: because I am obsessed with 3D and stupid
 dekaaspro#4965: there was a game with a cat merchant and you had to fight waves of enemies with dice that spawned cats or something and i really wanna play it but i can't find it anymore. Someone posted progress pictures in the progress picture channel but that got delete now so i can't find it anymore. Does anyone here know what that game was called?
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: People were talking about points or something and medians and stuff
Do you get a point for every star you get? And is that how you are ranked?
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: yes I don't know all the programming stuff
unity as a whole is easy to learn
c# is not
and I"m not gonna google every 0.0001 lines of code
 Michel#2879: why didn't u start from 2d lmao
 Peewi#8572: oh wow, I'm in the top half
 Santia#2861: I can code but I spent 10h on "how do light work"
because I insisted on trying the new light system for the sake of it
 theChief#0001: the median is currently 4, I'm so good
 Michel#2879: I think learning Unity isn't hard tho. But you may need programming experience if u didn't already have
Knowing to code from Scratch help your problem solving ability
 LOPSTERu#3902: im happy at 3
 Santia#2861: I'm happy as hell at 4 lol
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: being able to make your idea offline?
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: General reminder to keep asking for mutual ratings and for people to review your game to a minimum outside of 
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Mine has five right now
 Toboter#5206: I'm at 18, to my own surprise.
 Santia#2861: skipping through tutorials trying to find the fix you are searching for hits different during a time limit
 Kritical#4329: Now where's the fun in that
 Phallo#3476: i guess i should feel blessed... ours has 15 ratings already
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: guys I think this time I'll start from the beggining and follow unity tutorials and not google the world
 Michel#2879: imagine playing least rated to help poor devs
but then you find you game and realise you are the poor dev
 Acu1000#5560: Make an interesting thumbnail for your game, also post in 
 Peewi#8572: I'll rate your game, just send me the link. If you wanna rate my game, the link is in my discord bio
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: Last year's median was 21 but I expect that the median this year will be much higher as it feels like there's more activity this year (closer to 30?)
 Julien#2204: I just have 1 rating 😭 I would love more feedback since I'm considering working more on the game
 Santia#2861: lmaoooo
 LOPSTERu#3902: least rated are just games that have been deleted or you cant play lol
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Do you get a point for each star you get? And if so, is there gonna be a leaderboard for all 6000 submissions?
 BadPiggy#5202: Me after the jam :
I fear no man
But that thing
***it scares me***
 Michel#2879: I declare u a prophet of god
 Santia#2861: lmaoooo
 Michel#2879: Everywhere I go. I see those six faces
 theChief#0001: you can't _really_ know the median til the period is over. I reckon the median is around 4-6 at the minute, based on absolutely nothing but my gut feeling xD I haven't even looked at "least rated" yet
 Toboter#5206: Absolutely, I got 35 the whole last Jam. Most people had 3-5 last evening.
 Ahnaf30e#3408: ig so
 GODFATHER#6766: Well I'm gonna sleep now.
Didn't sleep last night nd thn I had University to go.
Now a nap of 13 hours all I need 😴💤
 Michel#2879: oh yeah So 15 at the first day is good enough?
 BadPiggy#5202: Has anyone found a beat-em-up in the jam yet ?
 Toboter#5206: In my experience, the final median is probably 20-30 at most.
 Julien#2204: I played like 7 and they were all radically different. So cool!
 Digitaldude555#5515: you confusing mean and median I think
 Kritical#4329: RIP my game at 1
 AaronBacon#2374: Yeh, still worked anyway lol
 BadPiggy#5202: Well I mean ...
 SleepyJeff#9492: Got it, thank you! also thanks to 
 Santia#2861: I only played like 3-4 games so far but damn I rolled a lot of dice
 Digitaldude555#5515: if you get lower your score will be destroyed, avoid at all costs.
 Michel#2879: oh is 15 below the median?
since I see games with 200
 theChief#0001: no, if you get fewer than the median number of ratings itch will lower your score
 S-Dev#8087: ohhh, I forgot to disable the fight button while in a fight.. That must be the bug
 Michel#2879: Particpants can rate any game they want.
Non-particpants have to play random games and rate them
 GODFATHER#6766: It's on public domain so yeah anyone can do if they have the link and access I guess
 USER#8646: probably gonna be me this year
 AaronBacon#2374: I just tried to send 2 dice against 2 enemies and then I could click fight again to spawn the dice again lol
 SleepyJeff#9492: This might be a silly question: Only the participants in this Jam can rate our games or anyone with an itch.io account can 😂
 Michel#2879: guys I wonder if someone got 1 vote with full stars do he get on top 100😳
 TheCorypheus#9146: Thanks
 GODFATHER#6766: I love that game, been playing for 2 years! Never get bored of it ❤️
 Tapu#9161: Uhh not now
 Toboter#5206: Wait till next Sunday
 TheCorypheus#9146: Is there a way to see the average rating of one's game?
 Digitaldude555#5515: is it a downloadable game? Dm me the game and I will review it.
 S-Dev#8087: wait how?!
 Michel#2879: oh it was nice n' dice sry
 BlankSlate#8922: Rate and comment on other peoples games
 Michel#2879: slice n' dice was a voice line of Mortis in brawl stars👀
 ESC#8775: My game name is literally the theme
 S-Dev#8087: Is there a way to get more people to play my game? I have tried a lot of things, but it still has only been rated by one person
 GODFATHER#6766: The game development is so much lively and fun.
I hope one day I'll have enough skills to enjoy on same pace as most of people here do...
I'm a beginner in Unity lol
 Digitaldude555#5515: 👍
 USER#8646: digital dude BTW i saw you're game its really good
 Yolwoocle#6689: What I love aboutthe voting period is that you can have a game that sucks but everyone will point out the good stuff and are super supportive to each other
 Kritical#4329: Good game adds no value to the critique it could mean good and bad
 BadPiggy#5202: I feel your pain lol
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: No but during the jam I asked him for his best dice pun game title and he said Slice n' dice
 Digitaldude555#5515: I leave critiques to the comments, its from years of getting "good game" and then seeing your rating be like 2/5.
 Michel#2879: mark is jaming?
 USER#8646: thats nice of you i try to rate everything atleast 12 ussaly 13 or 14
 BadPiggy#5202: Second last technically
 GODFATHER#6766: But how's that a fair judgment if you just gonna give everyone ++
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Mark, your dice pun game title got used! Check the last game in  lol
 S-Dev#8087: THANK YOU!!!
 Jasper#7906: This was my first jam, but my scoping was great. Basically because I both had a simple idea, and because my prioritization was good, building towards the first playable version first, then building towards a fun playable game, and then adding the most important and valuable features each time. Those are basically concepts I picked up at work, and have been developing in my personal (non-game) projects - even though time pressure is quite different in both. Turns out you can use non-jam skill in your jam 😄
 Digitaldude555#5515: every game  I review I give a 5 for their best category no matter the game.
 USER#8646: i got 10 reviews too although im scared theyre probably all 1 start
 GODFATHER#6766: Its all good, hope you feel better
 Peewi#8572: I'm sure we're all cool people that would never forget this, but I'd like to point out that if you don't set the platforms on your file it can't be downloaded from the Itch app.
I ran into a game I had to download and unzip manually.
 SquidGeneral10#4090: what the hell 💀
 Amelia-chan#4996: yeah i'll give it a try
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: Mhm! It's the little nuances that make the games interesting.
 Digitaldude555#5515: mark is constantly exposed to epic game ideas, makes puzzle platformer. 🤣
 theChief#0001: I can't time myself out sorry. I've turned my fan off in penance, you can rest assured that I'm suffering in the... why is it 28C already, it's 10:30am
 Alicja#3407: i really liked the theme this year, even if i didnt finish. time to scour itch to see if someone submitted something also following "god playing dice with the universe"
 GODFATHER#6766: When admin is your homie 👀
 Yolwoocle#6689: The worst theme I ever had was "3 ghosts: past, present, future"
 Michel#2879: uno reverse card
 BadPiggy#5202: Imagine telling a mod not to spam
 Santia#2861: even the tiniest variation of the same idea is interesting to me
 GODFATHER#6766: No spamming here
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: But what does it mean?
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: Same! I've seen a few other games that are puzzles involving rolling dice, but I don't think any use them quite the same as mine does.
 Michel#2879: yeah the weekly jam makes theme voting like 6 hours before the jam and they end up with very bad themes
 theChief#0001: english rarely makes sense - "Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo" is a valid sentence
edit, damn it wrong reply 
 Digitaldude555#5515: ah you just go to your submission, it says rated by x people
 BadPiggy#5202: Of course, but I'm always in the mood for a beat-em-up.
Similarly, you may have subconsciously been in the mood for a rogue-ey game :linkSmug:
 Santia#2861: I'm glad our idea/concept was fairly unique from the games I've seen so far. lots of fun interpretations from all the submissions!
 john333#5533: we actually read about it too when we were lost in brainstorming haha
 USER#8646: i ment where i see how many ratings i have but now that you mentioned it ill check out your game too
 theChief#0001: 100% this - the best themes are the ones that spawn a whole host of different games to play!
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: But I need a lot of bucks to pay rent.
 Digitaldude555#5515: minijam is kinda brutal though I got 2.5/5 and that was enough to be in the top 30% of games.
 Julien#2204: I liked the Jam theme! I also learned that die is singular and dice is plural, apparently. English doesn't make sense sometimes 😆 I messed up and used "dices" in my game
 Yolwoocle#6689: You don't need to pay a buck to make games!
 Mark Brown#6982: i never want one specific type of game - i want to see lots of different variations on the theme!
 Wisdom#4545: Ok, thanks for the information.
 BadPiggy#5202: This.
I love the limitations that mini jam has
 Amelia-chan#4996: you can upload it to a new page, but cannot have a link to the new one on your jam page
 Digitaldude555#5515: its in 
 Casper#6361: imo the themes for the GMTK jams are always top notch. Esspecially when you compare it to the other  big counterparts (e.g. ludum dare)
 Yolwoocle#6689: I like what mini jam does, they have a often simple one-word theme that is known in advance, but a limitation that is only known once the jam starts
 BlankSlate#8922: The next theme should be "Make it exactly like Donkey Kong Barrel Blast" if it has a single difference no matter how small disqualify the game
 DevByMarc#7784: Currently im at 9
 Wisdom#4545: Hi, is it okay to upload the finished version of our game to the same Itch.io during the game jam voting period? Also, are links from the game jam version to the final version allowed?
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: I would do more game jams if I had time and money.
 USER#8646: where can I see
 BadPiggy#5202: Don't jam too much like me
I can't work on a game for more than a week lol
 mastace#2935: 'knew it 😉
 theChief#0001: it's one of my favourite things to do, and I've been doing it for 13 years now 😂 the numbers add up quickly!
 mastace#2935: Thank you!
 BadPiggy#5202: I thought Mark just wanted a rogue-ey game, which is why the theme is what it is
 USER#8646: thanks for organizing this mark it was so much fun
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: the theme was my favourite part of this jam
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: I know the Godot Wild Jam does this but I think they handle it better. Mainly because they give plenty of time to suggest and vote for themes.
 Yolwoocle#6689: Next theme, crash itch.io's servers
 Peewi#8572: you guys sure jam a lot. This is only my second one.
Last year I spent four months on one game and it wasn't even that much bigger than some of the more impressive jam games
 theChief#0001: yes and no 😉 sometimes I scope really well, sometimes I make a prototype for an idea and love it so much that I just keep going! That's what I did this year 😬 I had a top down rhythm shooter done within half an hour and rolled with it, even though it was WAY too much for the time I had available!
 mastace#2935: first game jam in over 10 years
 Mark Brown#6982: hah, no - all jam feedback is good feedback
 Michel#2879: yeah I know a jam that makes themes off community choices and it really sucks
 BlankSlate#8922: Finally a challenge
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: I'm on 8-9 jams I think
 Julien#2204: "Don't" is cool lol
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: I've only done 6 game jams in 5 years. Huh. I mean, I guess I tried to join others but never managed to get a finished product.
 SquidGeneral10#4090: daaamn, publicly shamed for not liking the dice 🤣 soz mark
 mastace#2935: Next theme should be more off a challenge. Combat but you cannot die, or shop where you don't use money . Something to push people out of their comfort zone by introducing something familiar but must be approached in a new way.
 theChief#0001: you're not going to catch up with those rookie numbers smh, I did more than that in a single year at my peak xD
 USER#8646: lol
 Julien#2204: A true master. Did you get better with the scope over time? I'm at my second jam, but I ended up with an incomplete game both times
 BlankSlate#8922: Game jam where you make a game in a picosecond
 BadPiggy#5202: Or just do mini jam every alternate week kek
 Digitaldude555#5515: Do trijams its held every week and you have to make a game in 3 hours
 BadPiggy#5202: 20 something. Idk
 Phallo#3476: we should have an honorable mention to the best unfinished game... that way i have a chance 😭 😂 😭
 theChief#0001: (also I've been jamming for _10 years longer than you have_ lol, 13 total! Didn't do any for my first three years of learning game dev, which was a huge mistake)
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: My first jam was 2017. Specifically one of the UE4 jams that year.
 USER#8646: where do i see how many ratings
 theChief#0001: how many are you on now?
 BadPiggy#5202: You may have been jammin for 10 years ....
But I have jammed for 3 years. I'ma catch up :linkBonk:
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: Yep
 USER#8646: oh ok, so that it doesn't spoil the announcement
 Yolwoocle#6689: Mark, if I ever organize a game jam at my school, I will def steal your themes- they're too good!
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: You could almost say... The chief of game jam knowledge.
 R2D2Vader#0693: four dimensional
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: Once the rating period ends and Mark has announced his video
 BlankSlate#8922: You can only see how many ratings not the score
 theChief#0001: of course it does, I'm the source of all game jam knowledge - I am the one true jam authority
 swarm#1128: YET MY fEET CANT TOUCH THE GROUND
 SquidGeneral10#4090: theme idea: "Don't"
 BadPiggy#5202: In the voice of Sekiro :
***Heresy***
 USER#8646: but does anyone know if i can see my ratings
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: Theme idea: What goes up must come down.
 AlpalcaLad#2549: if anyone wants me to check out their game dm me
 BadPiggy#5202: Okay, I won't lie. That sounds cool
I'd make a small superhero game for this lol
 john333#5533: our team didnt really like the theme that much, it seemed too specific, even when we tried to think outside of the box but still werent satisfied enough with all the ideas we came up with even after hours of brainstorming, but i guess it boils down to preferences, we prefer more abstract themes, however we are still happy with what we made
 Koolento#6688: the best themes are vague enough for peoples creativity to shine
 swarm#1128: that has more to do with the short time limit really. No matter the theme people will always be making platformers and shootemups especially solo devs
 BlankSlate#8922: All my enemies in my game are just dice men lol I wanted to add more enemy designs but didn't have enough time
 dhafo#4640: if my wife walked up to me and said "bigger is better" i would cry 😭
 Kritical#4329: If that was the theme there would be atleast 1  rick roll
 theChief#0001: my favourite theme by far is "power" - there are SO many interpretations of this
electricity, the ability to affect change, literal strength/superpowers, etc etc etc. I could go on for days
 Amelia-chan#4996: nah combine genres is a boring theme
 Digitaldude555#5515: The theme was good for gameplay creativity but awful for artistic creativity sooooooooo many games are just look at this walking dice men, or the bullets are dice or everything is dice.
 BadPiggy#5202: Look up Ludum Dare 41
 BlankSlate#8922: Next theme should just be a strict outline for a very specific game and disqualify anyone who doesn't follow it exactly/s
 SquidGeneral10#4090: I think it was too smol. see: the infinitely repeated game concepts
 USER#8646: wait mark is streaming?
 Phallo#3476: if the theme was "expect the unexpected" i would have just made a game using last years theme to really throw people off 😂
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: I tried thinking of themes as a thought exercise and the only one I came up with was "All at Once"
 PowerfulBacon#3338: I think the theme was too open
 Amelia-chan#4996: the theme is up to interpretation, doesn't have to be a physical die
 theChief#0001: I hate this theme, it's not a theme, it's something that most games do anyway 😂 also, the "genre mash" jam we ran on GDB had the fewest submissions and the lowest submission rate BY FAR
 iofractorg#6427: should I submit my completely unfinished game that's pretty much just a sandbox that I probably wouldn't even consider a game for you to stream?
 USER#8646: restrictive theme is fine imo as long as it can be interpreted in many ways
 tykenn#8548: I found a clicker game that had me rolling millions of dice per second, so that's a conservative estimate
 BlankSlate#8922: Imagine if you had to keep adding more time just to account for that so GMTK game jam 2100 is gonna be 48 days
 Digitaldude555#5515: thats interesting
 AaronBacon#2374: I think the theme was good. Room for creativity while still having a good direction for games to go
 Mark Brown#6982: Why did you think you needed a cube? A "roll of the dice" can just mean using a random number (as one of many, many interpretations)
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: Game which you run but can't effect except that it makes game save files and you can edit those.
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: Have you considered the theme "Shoot to Move"? /j
 BadPiggy#5202: Combine genres
 Mark Brown#6982: There was literally a time when my wife and I were just saying stuff like "Bigger is Better. Expect the Unexpected" at each other
 swarm#1128: Personally i like a restrictive theme
 SquidGeneral10#4090: Something totally abstract like "chungus" to see what weird stuff gets made
 Digitaldude555#5515: zero player game theme imagine everyone making movies
 quantum#0043: uhh anything easier than placing a cube
 Woahsea#4308: i thought the theme was pretty good
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: Looking forward to the streams!
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: That's actually another thing about my game. I managed to make a game in 48 hours without any crunch.
 Gman#6328: I think you are going to roll about 20,000 dice by the end of the week 😂
 Amelia-chan#4996: audio slider
 USER#8646: mine was definitely unoriginal lol
 theChief#0001: I can imagine mark just wandering around the house saying random phrases in that silky smooth voice
 Mark Brown#6982: What theme would you like?
 BadPiggy#5202: Best theme was " dual purpose design "
 LOPSTERu#3902: MAYBE a little bit of a worse theme on this one (jk)
 Mark Brown#6982: Yep, details will be provided here when I have concrete plans
 quantum#0043: petition for easier theme next year.
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: This is why I uploaded 9 hours before the jam ended. I was going to bed and didn't want to crunch the next day.
 swarm#1128: games with a lot of ratings usually have a pleasing art direction and at least a few screenshots to show it off. It helps to make the game page pretty and somehow original
 wren#0640: I think the gmtk themes have been consistently very good
 Mark Brown#6982: Not beating myself up, as I say - the number of submissions is proof that people were able to find ideas
 RomketMan#0055: Marks just got a big book of old timey phrases he uses for themes.
Gmtk2023 theme: "in for a penny, in for a pound"
 BadPiggy#5202: Oof.
 SquidGeneral10#4090: that was my entry for last year lol. tower defence and dungeon crawling
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: I know it's probably been asked but are you streaming this year Mark?
 Mark Brown#6982: Design by committee is the best way to make something bad, lol
 wren#0640: when do you plan on streaming games?
 Kritical#4329: Kinda fits for "roll of the dice"
 Phallo#3476: nah, dont beat yourself up about it... people are willing to make a game about anything and this was a perfectly fine theme... also it got us to see how many people had unoriginal game ideas 😂
 BadPiggy#5202: Of course.
Now for next year's theme
" combine genres "
 LOPSTERu#3902: At least now I'm a bit better at isometric puzzle games where you rotate a dice!
 Digitaldude555#5515: its crazy how this jam has better themes than ludum dare even though ludum dare themes are voted on by 1000s of people
 USER#8646: theme was nice a little more specific than usual but loved it
 Kamigaru#7468: Next year theme - "It wasn't me"
 BlankSlate#8922: People will always try and do it as last minute as possible lol
 Mark Brown#6982: After out of control and joined together, i just put together lots of random little phrases until something interesting popped out 😛
 SquidGeneral10#4090: with the same ~5 concepts repeated ad infinitum 😝
 Digitaldude555#5515: you mean extra 3, it was extended
 Michel#2879: Actually I liked the theme more than 'Joint together'
still out of control was the coolest
 Delphine Noel#1196: when no game had any rating, people were playing all games randomly. But now that they do, people only play games with higher rating. So how well your game will do will depend on initial ratings
 Gman#6328: Maybe it was the extra 2 hours
 Santia#2861: everyone was just crunching lmaoooo
 USER#8646: can i somehow see my ratings
 Mark Brown#6982: I was starting to panic about the theme being too restrictive when we only had about 3000 submissions going in to the last hour. Maybe it was too difficult? Maybe people didn't like it? But then, bam - even more games than 2021!
 quantum#0043:  atleast 15 or 20
 BadPiggy#5202:  pardon the ping,
But could you tell us now what the inspiration behind the theme was ?
 Gman#6328: how many reviews do you think you need to get to the top 100?
 Santia#2861: I think the theme was great lol especially being very open to interpretation.
It also went against how I usually do things so I loved it personally
 BlankSlate#8922: The theme is the same as my last game jam but I am actually quite happy with it cause it forced me to get out of my comfort zone by avoiding making something too similar to my last game
 swarm#1128: i blame Mark for making me dream about dice for 2 consecutive nights
 Digitaldude555#5515: great games will get ratings simple as that.
 quantum#0043: yeah  i couldnt think of many ideas
 SquidGeneral10#4090: no amount of king dice gifs can stop me, sir 😛
 Delphine Noel#1196: Why does it feel to me that whatever rating you get in the beginning, is all rating you will get and it won't change. Like an iceball effect games with more rating will keep getting more rating while games with less rating will stay there.
 MrRedShark77#2280: ooo thanks to comment!
 BadPiggy#5202: ( oinks in yay )
 SquidGeneral10#4090: Mark I'm still salty about this theme 👺
 Digitaldude555#5515: sus
 Santia#2861: lets gooooo
 wren#0640: woo!!
 Mark Brown#6982: Looks like every game in the jam has at least one rating!
 BadPiggy#5202: All of the comments say that the game was hard lol
I guarantee my rank will go down cus of enjoyment
So the streak will probably continue
 quantum#0043: i dont no how to get more than 10 ratings
 SquidGeneral10#4090: end of the week iirc
 Lascif#0184: Do we know when the jam scoring/rating ends?
 SquidGeneral10#4090: Still think you make your worst games for GMTK,  ? Where's stompy dicey rate in your personal lineup?
 Michel#2879: Feedbacks suggest crazy ideas like it was a 7 days jam
 SquidGeneral10#4090: I'm definitely not streaming any jam games this year, I think it got my previous entry reviewbombed 😆
 BlankSlate#8922: You still need a certain amount of ratings though
 Lascif#0184: I wish it was done on playtime 😅 I've had a few people say they've played our game for over 30 minutes. Who knows if they like it or not though
 Michel#2879: oh ty.
 SquidGeneral10#4090: that's why it's probably better to get 20 good ratings and bury your head in the sand
 dardasaba#9759: Yeah
 BadPiggy#5202: Yes
 Michel#2879: oh so for example a game with 20 positive ratings can outrank a game with 200 negative ratings?
 dardasaba#9759: The ratings themselves, obviously you won't get first place if 500 people rated your game horrible :D (just an example, I'm not saying your game is horrible xD)
 BadPiggy#5202: Ratings themselves
 SquidGeneral10#4090: I feel that. the world / map design just isn't very accessible
 BadPiggy#5202: The best game to ever have been born from a jam is broforce
 Digitaldude555#5515: I tried twice to play it but was hard so I took a break came back a week later got completely lost in the map and forgot the mechanics. One day I will fully play it.
 Michel#2879: is your place choosen based on the amount of ratings or the rating itself
 Santia#2861: lmaoooooo
 SquidGeneral10#4090: wish it didn't, I hate that game lol
 PatateNouille#5627: 👌
 Santia#2861: yep, learned that. But yea this wasn't about making the best thing or doing stuff the right way, but learning how to do things at all. goal is more than accomplished and everyone was happy with the end result.
 Toboter#5206: Wasn't "Attraction" the theme at some point?
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: no because most people would just steal his idea or his full project of untitled magnet game
 wren#0640: magnets is way too close to joined together
 Digitaldude555#5515: mark should have made the theme magnets, that would be funny.
 Toboter#5206: Well, they must allow something, otherwise you'll end up submitting hand written OpCode.
 PatateNouille#5627: using source control tools is definitely a process to learn before it becomes really useful, otherwise it can easily become a foot gun, same for working with a bigger team than you're used to, it takes a different kind of management and planning to enable everyone to be efficient without encroaching on each others, hopefully it works out better for you next time
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: imma play Mark's platformer toolkit
 Santia#2861: yes but that's boring
*Also we used UE5 for the first time and I had problems importing my UE4 assets so we winged it*
 Digitaldude555#5515: I havent seen a jam that doesnt allow premade code.
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: yes, it was a failure. WAS because now it has 5 stars lol
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: Depends on whether the jam even allows premade stuff.
 Digitaldude555#5515: really you should have a menu and pause screen premade every jam if you are using it.
 Albur#4008: Yes; ThatGuyGlen has a video with much detail about the creation of *Hollow Knight*, and he included this. Fun fact: said previous game had rather bad marks, and it was very different from its ‘successor’. 😉
 Santia#2861: Ay it's what happens when everyone is panicking in a time limit
Specifically because only 2/4 used git before lmao
 Digitaldude555#5515: 5 pause buttons nice
 Toboter#5206: Fair, that's just stupid.
 Santia#2861: Yea about that people kept pushing to the wrong branch
 Toboter#5206: Branches.
 PatateNouille#5627: I'm glad this year the theme announcement video didn't suggest much, it seems to have led to more diversity, also great theme, both very suggestive of an idea open to interpretation while not being an obvious specific game everyone would think about
 plasol#9766: we even lost a couple hours of work or so
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: Did you know Celeste was originally a jam game? Probably, considering that they put the jam version inside the full game.
 Santia#2861: People kept pushing all changes and overriding each others progress. Our pause button was remade 5 times and I had to redesign the map 4 times, it was pain
 plasol#9766: We had some nightmare with git too 😪
 Digitaldude555#5515: did you know the people that made rogue legacy made a game called dont shi your pants.
 Santia#2861: Yea 100%.
This jam was just all about learning new systems and new ways to do things for us which was a big W
 Toboter#5206: Well, sounds like you at least learned a lot.
Don't underestimate the value of your first Git screw up 😉
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: Oh, very fun.
 Santia#2861: Yes but we had it set up incorrectly.
Just stuff that happens when you work in a team of more than two for the first time lol
 Toboter#5206: Did you use Git?
 Santia#2861: I didn't lol
 MrBen#0001: ye we know
 Toboter#5206: I had a friend make the graphics, but did the programming and writing myself.
 Santia#2861: Also having 3 people code at once is a bad idea I have learned
I never coded with multiple people so...that was something
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: Oh, very cool!
 Santia#2861: I am very glad the stress made us think of a fun concept we want to redo from scratch as a full game though
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: This is why I just made the majority of the game by myself until my girlfriend offered to make some levels and I let her do that.
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: did you knew that this jam game growed and became.... HOLLOW KNIGHT?
 Toboter#5206: Very responsible.
 Santia#2861: yes which is why I had everyone together several times to not do random shit or fix tiny issues that no one would notice lmao
 Straycat#1422: that's why the webbrowser version is still loading I think, it's not on time. xD
 Toboter#5206: That's why leadership is important 😉
 Koolento#6688: not even close
 MrBen#0001: I should probly update the banner and thumbnail. It's not that attractive
 Straycat#1422: I submit my game 5 sec before deadline 💀 lol
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: My game was actually entirely completed 7 hours before the jam ended. But that's because I wanted to sleep past 10 on Sunday and I live in PST.
 MrBen#0001: well my logo is just a text lol
 Santia#2861: I had one of the downfalls of working in a team which was "hey but we could do this, let me try doing that" and just everyone losing massive focus of the scope lmao
 Toboter#5206: Got the logo in literally as that part of itch buckled.
 MrBen#0001: haha
 Toboter#5206: I submitted 3 hours before, then spent the last 3 hours replaying and bugfixing.
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: I submitted it before itch crush
and then I go: let's put some music files for anyone wanna hear them
*itch crashes when I send them*
woops
 L3mmy♡#2307: Aight, thanks!
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: Gamefromscratch is cool for finding new stuff. Though generally I just look at the video titles and then research the tools myself lol
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: 10. down from 25 last year
 Onomi#7378: The greatest thing about my game is that it says “submitted 14 seconds before deadline”
 MrBen#0001: ? wdym
 BlankSlate#8922: It used to
 Santia#2861: 10 I think unless you submitted, than you can do it right away
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: guy has to have genuinely covered like 150 game engine
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: BLENDER HAS A GAME ENGINE?
 L3mmy♡#2307: how many games do you have to rate before you can rate games other than those in your list ?
 MrBen#0001: I submitted my game 6 hours before deadline so I didn't have stress out about itch crashing 👍
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: there's a current fork of it but i can't remember what it's called. like every other game engine there's a video on it on gamesfromscratch
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: and then the later 2 hours I was stupid and didn't bugfix so hello buggy game
 BlankSlate#8922: Yeah I have tried to do that but I just couldn't get it to work well I am still gonna keep trying though
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: Blender Game Engine was really bad and I don't think much was made with it. iirc they removed it in 3.0 and recommended people use Godot instead.
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: 1 hour before the 48 hour = end I wass stressed out
 Santia#2861: yes. I don't think people used it much but it was a thing.
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: I knew it and it helped me a little to set some decoration 1:30 hour before the end
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: it was bad
 wren#0640: didnt blender used to have a built in game engine?
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: Render out spritesheets from Blender maybe?
 Straycat#1422: me too. sadly, my 2D hand drawn animation that I working on is not working on web browser so it have to be dowload only...
 Santia#2861: Blender is actually good since I think 2.7 where they revamped a lot of UI and functions to make more sense and Krita always was kinda good but unknown, an artist friend showed it to me and I had an amazing time with it since.
 Toboter#5206: Btw, I discovered Unity 9-Slicing this Jam. Did y'all know it? It's great for tiled textures.
 BlankSlate#8922: I love making stuff in blender too bad I only make 2d games so I never get to use any of my 3d art
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: next jam I'll work outside-it's July after all
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: Honestly feel like Krita and Blender are the two big players in the FOSS scene. Actually being useful in their own rights and outdoing their competition in some ways.
 Santia#2861: I feel that, I got a basement apartment and I was dying
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: Well I don't want to close my door for the next week
ya know I have bro and sis so I had to close the door  and the room wasn't getting proper air due to small windows and my brain was melting
 Mark Brown#6982: Yep
 Santia#2861: Krita has a feature for tiled textures that is amazingly useful, could make some nice stuff in it if you can do digital drawing
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: anybody who calls gimp a photoshop alternative has never used either of those programs
 RedSantar#0027:  i'm curious, are you gonna make public the game engine used stats ?
 BlankSlate#8922: Imma try to play and rate at least 3 jam games for every rating I get
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: one of those foss programs that are actually good rather than one of those ones that are just there for people to point to and say 'there's a foss version of x!'
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: Think GIMP but more useful for spritework and animations.
 Jay Kozatt#3279: Oh maaan... I wish I had done the the in-browser thing. Feels like too many people are passing me by, because they gotta download my game.
 Toboter#5206: I'll mark that down!
 MrBen#0001: never heard of it 🤔
 Santia#2861: Free drawing software that is pretty good after some config changes
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: Really nice open source drawing program.
 Toboter#5206: What's Krita?
 MrBen#0001: hm
 Santia#2861: Blender + Krita carrying my hobbyist game dev efforts for 0 bucks 🙏
 BadPiggy#5202: I'm going back to playing the first silent hill after the jam is over
For now though, I'ma play jam games when I'm free
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: Yoooo blender + Krita power combo
 BlankSlate#8922: I am just happy to finally make something after months of being burned out
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: Definitely take a break after participating in a jam. Rest, recover, and celebrate!
 BadPiggy#5202: Wowie ig. It's next month so a decent amount of time to rest for now lol
 Santia#2861: Yes I don't want to see UE, Blender or Krita for at least a week
 BlankSlate#8922: I just don't add music at all last time I tried to add music to a game everyone commented on how bad it was 🥲
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: don't
go sleep
or eat
or anything
 Santia#2861: Funfact, the main menu song would reset randomly to 100% ignoring your audio slider for years
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Me too
 Koolento#6688: honestly more people should do that instead of ear-bleeding :D
 5fm#0001: I'm going to be participating in the wowie jam that starts 12th of august.
 Cameron#7818: GMTK Jam 2023
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: Oh gods I haven't played that in so long but I remember the music so distinctly.
 BlankSlate#8922: My sfx are just simple beeps and boops after various things happen
 wren#0640: my games ever so slightly too quiet lol
 Toboter#5206: Help, someone cooked Mark! Now there's  GMTK Jam!
 kyboon#0475: I added music and sfx volume slider, I've joined enough game jams and have my audio system evolved to be easy and fast to implement
 swarm#1128: the real life jam
 Cameron#7818: What is this link?
 5fm#0001: the only SFX I have is a door closing sound for the first entrance, the background music is a bit loud though *oops*
 Santia#2861: CSGO Main Menu Music wants to know your location
 WorkingJoe#4433: Hmm you're right time to eat
 MrBen#0001: I got SOOO lucky with my music designer. DM if u wanna hear the soundtrack 🤩
 Amelia-chan#4996: It just annoys me when a game is super loud and has no audio slider. If you aren't gonna add a slider, make the game quiet by default
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: strawberry jam.
where is the jar again?
 Toboter#5206: I only have SFX anyways, so it didn't matter to me.
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: I *think* my audio design is subtle and quiet enough that you wouldn't need a slider but I might be wrong.
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: I get around it by using awful colour combos everyone can see, but no one wants to look at
 WorkingJoe#4433: So what jam are we onto next?
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: No need if you only put 1 music element!
NO sfx in my game
Sorry
 Fox#3756: I usually add a music volume and an SFX volume; it's pretty easy to implement with my system of doing sound in Unity.
 piethedestroyer#3192: wanted to do that too! ended up adding a monochrome option for my colour game haha
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: no need for it
I just put in my project:
***SOUND WARNING LOWER DEVICE VOLUME***
and I'm okay
 BlankSlate#8922: It's just a nice feature to add to your game imo. I really wish I thought about it beforehand
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: Separate mixers is one of those features in Godot that's really hard to find but so nice when you find it.
 Toboter#5206: You  still need to make the options menu
 Amelia-chan#4996: My original comment was a joke by the way
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: But it should at least be considered and acknowledging it but time constraints is a better reason than "don't need it"
 SquidGeneral10#4090: it ain't too bad, you can have separate mixers
 Toboter#5206: I mean, yeah, but that's complicated and shouldn't be the focus in a 48 hour jam.
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: Honestly I'd probably have had a better main menu if I hadn't realized this jam was happening after 5 hours already passed.
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: OH MY GOSH GOT A JAM IDEA BUT JAM ENDED
you are a dice
and you see the world black and white
 Tapu#9161: Not if you make red dots health and black dots attack power
 WorkingJoe#4433: I think it would be really nice if it were possible to have your game disqualified (if updated with a fix) but still have it be rated or show up in the random ratings. Because if you would have to fix your game a week later you will have much less people play it
 Amelia-chan#4996: I might not want to lower the volume of my whole browser
 Tyrix#6647: good we had 50 then
 swarm#1128: Good thing about dice is that they are colorblind friendly by default :)
 Cameron#7818: I am glad that we have independent fact-checkers in this discord. You are truly a man with integrity, good sir.
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: Because sometimes you want to lower the volume of one specific element?
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: Probably disqualified.
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: guys it's so sad, from yesterday 58 jam games leaved the jam for some reason
 Toboter#5206: ... not in 48 hours? Also, why tf is an in game slider more accessible than the one you already have in Windows?!
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: Reminds me I should have colour blind tested my game
 Amelia-chan#4996: yeah this isn't allowed
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: this is fake it doesn't exist for me
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: I opted out of settings menus because I didn't have the time. Though I did still have a main menu for the sake of having a Fullscreen button.
 Bluepir#6159: Oh goodness, thank you for reminding me, let me fix that
 MrBen#0001: I have menu 😏
 Cameron#7818: Windows sound controls do not apply to individual browser tabs.
Devastating for people who use browser discord while playing games.
 Amelia-chan#4996: have you heard that games should have accessibility settings
 wren#0640: i literally had a functional audio slider and just Forgot to add it
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: no every game has 1+ rating just some have 1 and no comments
 Digitaldude555#5515: menu? my game just starts into the gameplay, people only test games out for 1 minute, you want 10 seconds wasted in a menu? Game dev tip #40.
 MrBen#0001: audio slider is in ur system lmao
 Peewi#8572: Nice to know there's at least one thing I'd earn 5 stars in
 Santia#2861: considering we already used the melt your GPU light engine we could've skipped making functional graphics settings
 Amelia-chan#4996: yesssss
 5fm#0001: yeah, our game lacks a working menu when starting xD. You can only quit the game by alt f4'ing or closing the exe when not in full screen.
 Digitaldude555#5515: tons
 piethedestroyer#3192: i made a pause screen just to mute the sound
but then the game is unplayable XD
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: actually no games have 0 rates but ok
 Bluepir#6159: Yeah we don’t plan to interfere with the system at all :3 thank you for your input!!
 MrBen#0001:
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: Yep! It puts you on the back foot and you feel the need to defend yourself. Alternatively: if someone is critical then they are more likely to respond to a follow up question you have
 Santia#2861: lets gooooo
 Digitaldude555#5515: submissions with 0 rates no browser games there.
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: I mean on one hand, yeah, but on the other hand, audio sliders are a pain to implement.
 Amelia-chan#4996: you tried, that's all that matters
 MrBen#0001: I got 20 :D
 Toboter#5206: Have you heard of a feature called the Windows sound controls?
 Bluepir#6159: That’s beautiful!
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: people who don't have audio sliders (me) will disagree
 Santia#2861: we have a broken one that only covers half the audio, does that count?
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: also I managed to get 4 rates
oh wait idea
imma rate games with 0 rates!
 MrBen#0001: nah
 Digitaldude555#5515: yes.
 Amelia-chan#4996: There should be a rating category called "Has audio slider"
 Toboter#5206: I mean, whatcha gonna do, comment "Thanks!" Ten times?
 WorkingJoe#4433: Because critique is more valuable to engage with
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: me? (not many, I decided to play brawlhalla instead of jam games)
 Straycat#1422: I do, I check like... 15 games already
 Bluepir#6159: We don’t plan to modify the original page, it’s just that there’s so many people I was excited to show this creation to ^-^ since our game isn’t even accessible on the original, I don’t know if it changes much.
 Digitaldude555#5515: Also anyone notice when you say 10 nice things about a game in the comment and then one critique you get the dev responding to the critique lol.
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: i don't think so, people like me scroll through and play games that look cool
 Santia#2861: Be one of those people and then you know for sure
 WorkingJoe#4433: I'm just using the random game stuff
 Delphine Noel#1196: is anyone even playing games from there?
 MrBen#0001: good for you then
 Straycat#1422: update after the event bro...
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: wow  had 6 hours but still it's very active!
 theChief#0001: why not just... update it once the rating period ends?
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: I open games in tabs to play them later. If posting it gets 1-2 people to do that then it's better than nothing.
 Toboter#5206: Games don't really get buried. Everyone gets shown random games. If you want a better chance, comment on other peoples games. They see your game below your comment.
 Bluepir#6159: We’re making a patched version even if it disqualifies us. We want a game even if we don’t get to be part of the event, you know?..
 WorkingJoe#4433: It's not about the reviews, it's about the games we made in the process
 theChief#0001: oh, so it does - we've been pretty chill about that because it's difficult to spam with a 6 hour timer 😂
 mastace#2935: I am so sorry that really sucks
 Takago#8059: it says in the description one game only gets one message
 Bluepir#6159: Unfortunately, when my team and I uploaded our game, it was 4am and we didn’t think to click it in browser, so ours doesn’t work at all ^-^”
 Digitaldude555#5515: 🤔 I got 8 ratings so doing fine, but I can dm.
 Santia#2861: gamejams are not about ratings, you did a bunch of stuff in 48h, thats the thing ya should take value in
 theChief#0001: they are allowed to 😛
 mastace#2935: I will review dm me
 Digitaldude555#5515: review my game is pointless anyway, the game gets buried in 10 seconds
 Santia#2861: people trying everything to get a single extra rating lmaoooo
 theChief#0001: I thought that was incredibly clear and left no room for interpretation at all
that said, can you make an exception for me please the itch crash screwed with the balance of my game, stopped me from having time to put in a menu and quit button, abducted my family and raised the temperature in the UK to ungodly levels
 davidstyrbjorn#6960: Thank you! 🙏
 WorkingJoe#4433: uncontrollable force
 mastace#2935: people are wild and crazy man
 davidstyrbjorn#6960: Cool, thanks! 😃
 Santia#2861: I am aware, I just wanted to see if I could use it for a tiny game as an experiment. aaand it works, not perfectly but it works, it has worked for several different non top spec computers, and it looks as we wanted. Experiment successful and now I know how to make sweet static renders in lumen lol
 Toboter#5206: Not much you can do. 6 in first day is normal. I got 35 in total last year.
 mastace#2935:  wow this is something lol
 Takago#8059: Why are people reposting their games in review-my-game channel if their not allowed to. I saw a game posted twice there
 Vasko#4044: 6 ratings is pretty high for the first day
 BanananaMonke#3591: Comment and rate other games
 tykenn#8548: While reviews were slow I tried shooting for #1 most karma. *Almost* had it (got up to #2) before reviews started coming in again. Still 4th for now though
 Digitaldude555#5515: rate other people games and leave comments, every comment links back to your game.
 Eliane#2931: Hey guys, how to get more people to play my game ? I have only 6 ratings and there are sooo many games out there, my game is lost in the crowd ah ah
 Aurélien#3461: My game kinda look bad, we had some issue with the workflow. but in the end, all of our team is pride of what we did. even if it was a mess
 Mark Brown#6982: No! And lemme show you where it says it in the rules
"Now that submissions are closed you are still able to update your page with new screenshots / logos / text / etc. However, you cannot upload new builds , and you may not link to new builds on other websites in your description or comments."
"When the jam ends, there's a one week rating period  where you must not change your game. Uploads to the jam will be locked, meaning you can no longer provide bug fixes, additional versions, or extra levels. "
 mastace#2935: ooh wonderful
 theChief#0001: yep, I'm on something like 16 or 17 years 😂 time flies
 Digitaldude555#5515: I started game dev before unreal got made free so there was only unity or rpgmaker, no one wants to use rpgmaker...
 Toboter#5206: You can't. Uploads are locked.
 MrBen#0001: true
 BanananaMonke#3591: No it’s a trash mobile game made over a adioactive gorilla
 Vasko#4044: I managed
 Digitaldude555#5515: lumen bad? I dont use unreal.
 davidstyrbjorn#6960: are you allowed to modify the game in anyway after the deadline? (small-bugfixes) 🤔 I didn't see anything in the rules about it
 MrBen#0001: lol then u interpretate me wrong. You should go on ue5 formus sometimes
 mastace#2935:  nope is that your game?
 BanananaMonke#3591: So, you play flying gorilla?
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: She*
 mastace#2935: its at 9 bucks atm, made of solid radioactive glass. Gonna wait till the hour gets slim so I can snipe it. Got a whole bunch of other bastards trying to bid on it. Gonna be sneaky.
 BanananaMonke#3591: You just said he sucked bruh. (Attacking the person not lumen)
 Digitaldude555#5515: 2 times a year next one in october used to be 3 times.
 Henry_Hamster#4240: hsinchu, its so hard to find pepole who know game dev here...
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: How often is ludum dare?
 Digitaldude555#5515: I mostly did ludum dare but now doing itchio jams
 BanananaMonke#3591: Bri’ish
 MrBen#0001: well I just wanted to tell you that lumen can't be used for high quality games because of laggy and clipping shadows
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: Oof, big ol' gatekeeping toxicity going on.
 BanananaMonke#3591: What did you bed for the radioactive gorilla?
 Digitaldude555#5515: I have over 20 over a period of a few years I think
 Santia#2861: I just wanted to try something new lmao, it worked
 MrBen#0001: who even uses this bruh. If u use lumen you reeally have no experience in ue lol
 Santia#2861: But it works
 BanananaMonke#3591: Lol. I chose it because of a discord gif
 MrBen#0001: bruh lumen is a laggy shit
 Toboter#5206: UE is better for photorealism, Unity for stylisation - if you use built-in shaders. If you make your own, it doesn't matter much.
 mastace#2935:  nice name, im bidding on a radioactive gorilla on ebay atm
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: Yeah Lumen is a cool system. I just wish it was feasible on lower end hardware.
 BanananaMonke#3591: Yea
 theChief#0001: it happens quicker than you think!
 Santia#2861: I literally only knew it as the benchmark engine lmaooooo
 BanananaMonke#3591: Aha
 WorkingJoe#4433: And to have little war people drive their little virtual tanks \:p
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: A game engine that's almost exclusively used for tech demos and GPU benchmarks.
 Santia#2861: Our game looks really damn sweet for having basically no art assets all thanks to lumen lmao
Also blueprint helped our artist chip in with tiny bits of scripting
 WorkingJoe#4433: It's a bit more code than usual, but I sort of like that
 MrBen#0001: yeah true
 BanananaMonke#3591: What is unigine
 Koolento#6688: Does anyone have any idea how the filter by popularity works? I feel like there are games with 4 reviews right next to ones with 60
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: Yeah, Unigine is real rare. I tried it but found it rather unwieldy.
 MrBen#0001: I don't think so. Ue has so many different tools on making SICK games compared to unity. It takes much less time to achive better graphics in ue.
 BanananaMonke#3591: Unigine?
 CyberWitch#3879: Hey can just the default executable build in Game Maker work for Mac?
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: This is very true. Engines are just tools, and while some tools are better for jobs than others, they're ultimately all just that. Though some engines *are* prone to different things.
 BanananaMonke#3591: Yea… in Unity I had some problems too. WebGL can be very fucking stupid but if it works. You should always use WebGL
 MrBen#0001: like really. Who will download 150 mb html game
 WorkingJoe#4433: I've been using Unigine for this jam. Very rare, since it's more or less marketed towards industrial/military applications. But it's got all the required features to make games, is very technically sound and the docs are amazing.
 MrBen#0001: which in ue is f**ed
 Santia#2861: Engines are a preference, you can do almost anything in any 3D engine if you wanna work it hard enough lol
I can't stand unity, but not because it's bad, it's amazing. I just learned UE first and feel comfortable in it. doesn't matter at the end lol
 BanananaMonke#3591: I just use WebGL :)
 Chowdog 宗翰#0135: Pretty good
 Straycat#1422: pretty good bro
 MrBen#0001: welp. but the looks... ue has os many pretty games :D
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: I went complicated and it's still 35mb in Godot.
 BanananaMonke#3591: I got rated 11 times so far. Is that good or bad?
 Digitaldude555#5515: 100??
 Chowdog 宗翰#0135: Mine is 10 mb in Godot 😄
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: Like, UE has the graphics and some fancy tools for AAA development but that's all it really has going for it imo.
 Santia#2861: You can cut down UE games with a decent amount of content to 100mb, it just takes some time, settings and care in your assets
 MrBen#0001: my game is 90 mb in ue ;)
 WorkingJoe#4433: I mean the look of the editor itself, UE's UMG stuff is actually pretty nice
 Chowdog 宗翰#0135: Wait your from Taiwan too? lol
I'm from Taichung
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: UE is a bit of a pain to use and the packaged games are always so big. I definitely prefer Godot.
 Santia#2861: I am the biggest UE fangirl but I'd personally not recommend it for small projects. Use the engine you just feel comfortable with though
 MrBen#0001: WHAT!? YOU DONT LIKE UE UI MAKER!?
 Henry_Hamster#4240: fellow taiwan person? I didn;t know there was anyone from taiwan here, I can't find anyone else D:
 WorkingJoe#4433: Honestly I should use UE rather than the engine I'm using now, UE has got many more features. But I despise UE's UI. It's so unwieldly
 Aurélien#3461: welcome to the club
 MrBen#0001:
 5fm#0001: For me it was my first game and first jam. With little unity experience as well, luckily my friend who entered with me had a reasonable amount of experience with unity.
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: Yeah, yours looks cool! Got a sort of LIMBO aesthetic going on.
 tinderet#7708: Off to bed for me now everyone, thank you for sharing your games & playing ours and I can’t wait to check out more tomorrow!!
 MrBen#0001: I wanted to make a level with dynamic water thats rising but I ran out of time :/
 Santia#2861: Yea same and I hate it for how unintuitive it is, but it can produce cool results.
 Woomek#4366: damnn you got an itch.io page?
 theChief#0001: It was 2 years ago that I stopped counting! Probably more like 110-115 now 😂
 MrBen#0001: I learned a lot about ue5 niagara system in this gamejam
 Santia#2861: Hey it wouldn't be gamejam without learning something completely new in a panic, good job 🤝
 Aurélien#3461: For me, it's my second game. For the moment i always done it with a team, but they need some good game design idea
 WorkingJoe#4433: Same, even though I didn't even get halfway to what I imagined, I did learn to do:
-procedural meshes
-cloth sims
-dynamic particle effectors 
Probably not the best things to do in a jam game lol but here we are
 Woomek#4366: 100 jams? LOL 😄 this was my 4th
 tinderet#7708: This is my second and I already feel the buzz hahaha
 Yuuni#1575: aye same, I learnt particle system in like 1 hour and produced 3 particle sets in that time. Feels good
 MrBen#0001: well I made many games but this is the first one I am **actualy!** happy with. It's fun, nice-looking and enjoyable. I learned so much during the gamejam
 theChief#0001: In what feels like no time you'll be in my position - I stopped counting after my 100th jam lmao
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: My team was me (West-Coast American) and my girlfriend (West-Coast Canadian). Though I did most of the implementation. She did puzzle design while we watched gravity falls.
 Digitaldude555#5515: First of many
 MrBen#0001: ayee
 Casper#6361: Ooh congratulations!
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: So relatable
 Santia#2861: Lets gooooooo
 theChief#0001: Well done 😁
 Aurélien#3461: Bravo ! It's a compliment in french
 MrBen#0001: thats my first **finished** game (altho I make games for 3 years now lol)
 Santia#2861: I learned how to use a new lighting engine, how to use particle systems, this is the most productive 48h I had in a while lmao
 Casper#6361: I actually don't know how many lines of code my game has but I think it escalated quite a bit.
 Yuuni#1575: lmao I feel you
 Chowdog 宗翰#0135: Yeah having a game out is already very impressive
 MrBen#0001: nice
 Santia#2861: and also learning a crap ton of stuff 🤝
 StormyMay#4100: our team had three(?) singaporeans, a frenchie, a west coast american and an east coast american
 theChief#0001: Yep, and jams are about getting things done - not doing things well 😉
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: To be fair, my game also isn't super optimal. I use raycasts and rotate functions and stuff which I'd generally avoid because of things like floating point errors. But the better way to code it would also be significantly slower, so I went slightly suboptimal for development's sake.
 tinderet#7708: Canada 🙂
 Aurélien#3461: i'm from France, in a little town call Landerneau
 Casper#6361: Yeah 10:20 here
 theChief#0001: I actually managed to stay relatively clean with my code! I started out by making a really awesome powerup manager, it works perfectly and it's nice and generic. I might even package it up to sell on the asset store 😂
The expectation was that my teammate would crack out a ton of really unique powerups, but it didn't happen 
 dardasaba#9759: I'm not in Europe but it's morning here
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: This is something important to learn. How to write code quickly and not over-optimize, but also have code that isn't going to be ultimately harmful to iterate on.
 Chowdog 宗翰#0135: So it's like morning in Europe right
 Casper#6361: It wasn't too bad in the end, but it definitely wouldn't have hurt if it was just a tad more solid and organised.
 Santia#2861: We forgot to change our Project files to the final title so the game you download is called "ActuallyAVideogame" lmao
 Chowdog 宗翰#0135: I'm from Taiwan 😄
 Casper#6361: The Netherlands
 Digitaldude555#5515: I used to think the code didnt matter in jams just do spaghetti and do it as fast as possible but nah it always comes back to haunt you.
 WorkingJoe#4433: At some point during the project I stopped caring about class names, so in the end some classes have names that do not in any way match their function lol
 StormyMay#4100: this has made me want to dabble in basic coding and implementation to get a better grasp of how to optimize deliverables in the future
 Digitaldude555#5515: thats bad
 Casper#6361: There nothing that just works by itsself
 Chowdog 宗翰#0135: Where are you guys from tho
 Casper#6361: Ahaha I managed to get every important script to be dependent on another important script
 WorkingJoe#4433: Development relay game
 StormyMay#4100: we did too!! it was interesting and created a unique challenge for sure
 tinderet#7708: We did ours across 3 countries and 4 time zones too which was a cool experience
 StormyMay#4100: me and the other artist were in constant communication, self motivated, and were able to pretty much self assign tasks based on our strengths
 tinderet#7708: Yeah with ours we managed it through scheduled re-orientation meetings every 3 hours or so
 HI I'M VMAR!!™#4288: You pretty much need to have them in the same location
 wren#0640: i dont remember a 26 person team but i do remember a 24 person team
 Casper#6361: I don't know how you would work with 26 people, I struggled to understand my own code after 2 days, I doubt anyone but me would understand it.
 theChief#0001: I can't remember who that was now lol
 WorkingJoe#4433: If you're going to have duplicate roles in a team you better make very sure that they are basically married in terms of communication
 theChief#0001: ah
 Lukey#6052: Each side of the holy trinity is a masterful art, all three having their own challenges and strengths. When Code, Art, and Sound, are combined (with Design in the center) you create... GAME.
 Digitaldude555#5515: 26? did you make skyrim 2?
 wren#0640: nononono i was solo
 theChief#0001: wait wren were you the 26 person team?
 HI I'M VMAR!!™#4288: Cave story
 wren#0640: even toby fox has temmie to do the art
 WorkingJoe#4433: Embodied as a single man in that case lol
 Casper#6361: Music and programming is amazing. I don't like art
 Digitaldude555#5515: toby fox.
 tinderet#7708: It’s true!!
 Lukey#6052: amen.
 HI I'M VMAR!!™#4288: This game jam actually made me more confident making music. I didn't expect to be able to make so much music in just two days
 WorkingJoe#4433: The dev holy trinity of art, music and programming
 StormyMay#4100: our team was 6 with 5 constant contributors, one was a playtester
 Digitaldude555#5515: whats your game called so I can find it, now im intrigued
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: this was the first time i had a team of 3, i was very hesitant to try it but it worked out thankfully
 wren#0640: yeah the good old progammer + composer (and maybe sfx artist) combos hard to beat
 tinderet#7708: That’s sick!
 theChief#0001: I've had a few decent teams, it tends to work best when it's just me working on the game with someone else handling sound 😂
 tinderet#7708: LOL it was a lot of like… probably 6-7 base people doing the heavy lifting then some others contributing something essential one day things, like vfx animations or a handful of environments
 StormyMay#4100: I think the number one thing I gained from this game jam is the confidence to start looking to freelance for indie games because I actually have worked around the organization and have an understanding of expectations now
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: reading stuff like this always make me so grateful for my jam teams, they always go above and beyond
 Aurélien#3461: my plan is a master in Game Design. Plus, most of my wanted to try their first Game Jam
 HI I'M VMAR!!™#4288: Our team was 4 people. Two coders, one artist, and one sound/music person
 Casper#6361: Damn quite a few big teams then
 Digitaldude555#5515: 👀 you can start an indie studio now
 Straycat#1422: my team start with 4 and it end with 6 lol just drag all friend to help
 Digitaldude555#5515: six for a 2 day game jam thats like having 10 dudes make a pizza.
 tinderet#7708: Ours was 11, I know the feeling
 Aurélien#3461: agree
 HI I'M VMAR!!™#4288: Seven is a pretty big team. Needs a lot of coordination
 Yuuni#1575: oooooo ok. I think in Unity there's a development build that would enable debug or something. However I would have to write a few hundreds lines of code to even locate the bug 😦 it might be something with rendering or physics system
 Digitaldude555#5515: SIX?? bruh
 Casper#6361: I cut some time off of art by using premade assets this time.
 Aurélien#3461: my story is ... my team and i were suppose to be seven, but the seven prog' had a bit of an issue catching on what we where doing ... and so he/her decide to leave and we end up finishing the game in a team of six. ( it  was fun )
 Digitaldude555#5515: 🤔  there is development builds in unity
 Santia#2861: idk about unity but in Unreal you can make debug builds where you can add extra info to the players perspective and use console commands, Unity probably has debug builds too
 Digitaldude555#5515: yeah when you are solo dev my game jams are like this day 1 code, day 2 art. If it was team then 2 days for code or 2 days for art. hmmm
 Yuuni#1575: how would you debug a bug that only appears in built versions and not in the Unity Editor? Anyone has any clue?
 wren#0640: *this* is why i like being able to create assets as i add mechanics to my game, means i dont have to worry about implementing 30 power up textures in the last 30 minutes because the artist took too long or something
 HI I'M VMAR!!™#4288: We gathered at one friend's house and just worked on it. I think that really helped up be productive
 tinderet#7708: Big agree. Also, having a director that works towards each member’s strengths and weaknesses helps… same with delegation of work
 Santia#2861: also it helps morally because I would've abandoned the project on saturday afternoon if I didn't have support lol
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: Speaking of WebGL, is there another general-purpose game engine with the ability to play your game in a browser?
 Digitaldude555#5515: 😔
 Yuuni#1575: oh my bug makes the player disappear entirely if you alt tab while you're in the air. Also another one where you literally just get stuck mid air for a while - or infinitely
The fun part is that they do not appear in Unity editor mode
I wanna cry
 Casper#6361: I only have two SFX but those easily took 1 hours to creat and implement
 Silreth#4737: In a floor is lava style game, when the player clears the board there's about a 50/50 chance they're getting teleported onto the floor so 🤷  Good thing most people don't seem to be getting that far!
 Straycat#1422: dont be stress! just try to have fun lol
 Santia#2861: working in a team requires more planning and a lot of trust for your mates to finish what is on their to do list but if you do it right (and sacrifice working time for planning time) it works really well
 HI I'M VMAR!!™#4288: Tbh, soundeffects are pretty hard to do
 BlankSlate#8922: I really want to join a team for a game jam but the anxiety of letting other people down is too much for me to handle
 Casper#6361: Afaik my game has one rare but significant bug, a softlock.
also the audio guy gave me the soundtrack 30 minutes before I needed to leave the computer, and no sound effects at all 
 tinderet#7708: We ended up getting it working reliably and looking cool with shaders for a 3D object on a 2d plane! We had to make sure we got a fail safe in place incase it landed on an edge with nowhere to go to guarantee a roll and make sure the game didn’t softlock
 dardasaba#9759: Same! Only slight balancing issues on the difficulty levels
 BlankSlate#8922: I got this patched out right before the deadline luckily(Or at least I hope) but when healing if the characters health was below how much you would heal it would heal all the way back to full health even though say you would only heal 5 hp you instead heal back to full.
 HI I'M VMAR!!™#4288: If you do it with friends it can actually help you be less stressed. At least, it did so for me
 tinderet#7708: It’s funny because the rest of the game is all 2d art and it had NO idea what to do
 Santia#2861: Ours is like a reverse. It was intended as a platformer for beginners and advanced players. Turned out the first players that tried it made it into a speedrun lmaoooo
 MrBen#0001: cool pfp
 Digitaldude555#5515: physics in a game jam thats asking for disaster
 theChief#0001: amazing 😂 I love massive physics sims
 RedTeapot#1960: Although I had some funky homing bullets that would orbit an enemy endlessly
 wren#0640: i genuinely think id be more stressed with a team
 theChief#0001: I fully intended to make a really difficult game, but it ended up being incredibly easy because I had no time for balance or a game over screen xD
 quantum#0043: i just think my game is not up to the theme
 BadPiggy#5202: Nah. I'ma stay on the lone ~~pig~~ wolf route
 Santia#2861: Teams make it so much less stressful
But it does mess with art direction to some extent when you have to get each decision through other people
 Digitaldude555#5515: 🤔  maybe I should try making a team for a jam, I did like 20 alone.
 Aurélien#3461: i need to practice, it's been three months that i start making video game. (sorry for my English, i didn't write for a long time)
 Kritical#4329: i did the art and code, dont like doing the art i suck at it
 tinderet#7708: Absolutely. During a team meeting where one of our devs was live play testing with us, we spawned a die to do a fire attack, which is rigged to rolling an amount of dice according to your energy left and… it got caught in an infinite loop… so the enemies kept spawning d4 after d4 after d4, hundreds of them, all trying to roll with 3D in a physics based engine, I’m surprised the computer didn’t explode. The foley sfx we’d implemented also just kept going and I think it’s the loudest sound I’ve ever heard in my life
 wren#0640: me! except the music but that was done by a composer specifically for the game
 RedTeapot#1960: The bugs in our game (at least the ones I know of) are all boring. Like a weird collider or a top hat not obeying the enemy cap
 BadPiggy#5202: Yup
I did everything lol
 WorkingJoe#4433: My game's pretty much a demo of randomised procedural dynamic meshes with cloth physics. Recipe for bug disaster lol. I had to go through a lot of work to get things to go all over the place (literally) and still sometimes the meshes just wander off \:p
 Digitaldude555#5515: also any solo devs that did sound/art/coding? no preexisting assets
 Santia#2861: because we had janky github merges our jump height is different than intended. first jump is super difficult unless you know about your other movement options. Our game is just hardcore like that we swear
 wren#0640: luckily it seems like no ones come across any bugs yet, seems like my assumption that they wouldnt come up in normal gameplay was right for once lol
 Aurélien#3461: depend the schedule
 mastace#2935: I added a really cool feature last minute that added a bunch of bugs BBUT before that my game had almost no bugs!
 BadPiggy#5202: Either way, there's still a week left lol
Someone will probably find a bug
 Kritical#4329: i just have a frustrating bug where you cant attack...THE LITERAL ONLY THING YOU CAN DO ASIDE FROM MOVING
 Digitaldude555#5515: lol you should sleep cause there is only so many productive hours in your day lol.
 HI I'M VMAR!!™#4288: We have a very fun bug that makes one of the only features of our game just not work sometimes which was introduced at the last hour
 Aurélien#3461: witchraft
 wren#0640: i have so many favourites but i dont wanna say them bc god some of them make the puzzles completely trivial
 Straycat#1422: Thanks! It's very fun to draw wacky characters and wizard! xD
 BadPiggy#5202: This is the first time one of my games doesn't have a bug lol
 WorkingJoe#4433: *that you know of*
 Digitaldude555#5515: My game has no bugs surprisingly
 Kritical#4329: whats this sleep you guys are talking about?
 theChief#0001: nyoom
 theChief#0001: anyone got any favourite bugs from their game? I had a great one - less of a bug, more of a consequence that I didn't think through 😉 there was a powerup that multiplies speed for a short period of time every time you kill an enemy. There was another powerup that increased your shot spread, and another that increased damage. You could kill 10-20 things with one shot, which sent your speed through the roof 😂
 BadPiggy#5202: I actually slept well the night before Sunday lol
But the night before Saturday, oof. Couldn't sleep at all lol
 wren#0640: oh shit dude this looks sick!
 HI I'M VMAR!!™#4288: I had to do music and I pretty much spent 1/3 of my time doing nothing to get some inspiration
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: With all the dice I was thinking coolmathgames
 tinderet#7708: Oh your game looks sick! I’m an artist too and I love seeing games with killer art direction
 Santia#2861: I am surprised the team I was on had decent sleep throughout the weekend
 Digitaldude555#5515: Man some games are like good games I used to play on kongregate but made in 48 hours... hmmm
 Straycat#1422: I work on 2D art asset and I can say the art is amazing but i didnt sleep at all. lol
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: Rubicon do energy drinks that taste exactly like Rubicon they are lethal.
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: Our team got a good 8 hours each night so sleep we were fine. Diet on the other hand.
 HI I'M VMAR!!™#4288: Our team could hardly think about missing too much sleep
 The Handsome  Cat#6115: No actually
 WorkingJoe#4433: Wasn't planned though, just kind of woke up and couldn't get back to sleep. Wouldn't recommend it
 WorkingJoe#4433: I crunched for sure, definitely didn't sleep 2 hours yesterday
 tinderet#7708: Respect, man, thank you!
 wren#0640: oh neat every game has at least one rating now
 Kritical#4329: can you not see your own submission in the need ratings list?
 The Handsome  Cat#6115: 3
 tinderet#7708: Hah! I’m glad it spoke to you. I think burnout can happen through crunch, sure, but it can also happen through prolonged deadlines on things and refusing to make important design decisions. Challenges like this force you to pick what you’re doing and follow through on it
 HI I'M VMAR!!™#4288: It's an experience to even get something finished on time
 WorkingJoe#4433: I'm glad to have participated even though what I made can hardly be considered a game \:p
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: There's a button to find games without many ratings.
 mastace#2935:  I ffollowed all ur crew, your team killed it
 Santia#2861: there's probably a bunch of games with 0 ratings still. There is also a list of games without ratings so someone will see it sooner or later
 BadPiggy#5202: I couldn't think of any dice puns for my game tbh
 Kritical#4329: is it 0?cuz i only had one last time i checked
 no_ones#4897: gonna steal this line for my dev vlog
 tinderet#7708: Have fun with em!! 🙂
 mastace#2935: Ill review DM me it
 WorkingJoe#4433: That's probably a 1000 way tie \:p
 mastace#2935: I dm'ed you two
 The Handsome  Cat#6115: My Game is the game with the least amount with ratings, fuck
 mnikn#9647: me too
 Santia#2861: I'm gonna review some games later tonight
I wanna see all those dice puns in action and some fun ideas
 mastace#2935: I just reviewed some of yall's stuff, anyone else?
 syelan34#3258: Half of my unintended ones only work because of a glitch where I don’t do enough checks for if the player is going ever gaps so they can just teleport over them
 tinderet#7708: I get it! We had to make our scope smaller too. I understand the sentiment behind wanting it to be longer but I do like how a 48 hour game forces you to really focus on what’s attainable & learning how to design within a specific scope is useful
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: Sorta like how in Celeste, speedrunners found a glitch called Demodashing, and the devs were like "okay cool it's a feature let's just fix the animations so it doesn't look as weird to do" and then added secret routes that use it.
 Digitaldude555#5515: option 3 hope they arent found 🤣
 syelan34#3258: “It’s not a bug it’s a feature”
 Chowdog 宗翰#0135: Me too, had a lot of ideas, but had to cut some to finish up
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: There are two ways to respond to unintended solutions: Make them impossible, or turn them into intended hidden solutions.
 Digitaldude555#5515: I felt like my idea was good but I had to strip out a lot of the depth to it, feels bad. If it was a 3 day jam it would be so much better.
 syelan34#3258: Lol I have the same thing, playing through my game a few times all the levels have unintended solutions but they’re kind of silly
 Digitaldude555#5515: making a puzzle game in 2 days thats crazy
 MrBen#0001: dm ur game I will rate it :)
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: Honestly my biggest regret making my game was that I realized some of the puzzles have unintended solutions, but I didn't have the time to implement an incentive or reward for finding better solutions than the intended one other than just a move counter at the end.
 Giga chad#0085: ohw now I get it but I still have 2 ratings
 syelan34#3258: Ah that’s it then
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: Look for post jam productions discord server in the streams vids server channel. They are doing a rate4rate
 Santia#2861: ahhhhhh
 dardasaba#9759: They're ratings on the standalone game, regardless of the jam, but the ratings on the "rate this game" jam page show the jam ratings
 MrRedShark77#2280: "imagine good game is unpopular by 'corruption'"
 Santia#2861: analytics are bugged for me too, just check the page
 dardasaba#9759: The "ratings" on your dashboard analytics are different than the game jam ratings
 syelan34#3258: But then on the game page I have 8 ratings
 Giga chad#0085: what is cringe
 LOPSTERu#3902: wow it took me 2 hours to rate like 20 games dang
 MrRedShark77#2280: yes, know that is cringe
 syelan34#3258: For some reason my analytics says 0 ratings
 Santia#2861: remember you got a week to shill your game to people lmao
 Giga chad#0085: Bruh I got 0 ratings
 dardasaba#9759: You can't see the actual stars people gave you, you can only see how many you got
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: To be fair, 4 is already surprisingly stable at alpha12. Only issue was with texture compression on panoramic textures.
 Santia#2861: Ahhh alright lol
 syelan34#3258: No one can check what the rating is, just how many
 LM#4371: I wanted to make a web build but it was really unstable so I was forced to make a windows build
 Giga chad#0085: how to see how many rates u have
 HI I'M VMAR!!™#4288: Sorry man
 Santia#2861: how do yall even check the rating of your review, I can only see how many we got lol
 MrRedShark77#2280: 192 views, but 6 f- rates...
109 browser plays
 syelan34#3258: Only 2 so far
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: I just don't like web builds because they tend to be far more graphically limited.
 HI I'M VMAR!!™#4288: Lucky our coders could figure out how to make our game playable online
 Digitaldude555#5515: the games are tiny anyway so it wont be bad performance. Though some games even tiny ones I notice slow down for some reason lol
 dardasaba#9759: XD well, I guess I prefer only working on the stable version, but to each their own!
 HI I'M VMAR!!™#4288: Not having to download anything makes it easier
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: I mean, sure it's unstable, but that's part of the fun. Working around the engine quirks and stuff, having to do ridiculous things to make it do preloads and stuff properly. It's fun.
 Madness#5032: A huge one
 HI I'M VMAR!!™#4288: We’re at about 50 views and 10 ratings
 BadPiggy#5202: Just saying
but the ratings in your dashboard are separate from the ratings for the GMTK jam
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: 15.
 nakst#1416: I haven't gotten around to rating any games yet and I've already got over 20 ratings on my game?! I guess a HTML  build makes a massive difference, huh
 Digitaldude555#5515:   hmmm how many rating have you given to people?
 dardasaba#9759: Probably, Godot 4 is still pretty unstable so actually using it for projects already isn't wise xD
 HI I'M VMAR!!™#4288: Thank you!
 syelan34#3258: Wow that’s weird, 15 downloads but only 2 ratings
 Digitaldude555#5515: dashboard analytics
 HI I'M VMAR!!™#4288: Where are you able to see views?
 Static doodles#2251: Still surprised someone download my sad attempt for a game
 Lukey#6052: I'm pretty sure playing other games makes your game more likely to be recommended.
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: But if I used Godot 3, I wouldn't have had SSIL and some language improvements. So... *shrug*
 Digitaldude555#5515: I have only 10 views and 7 ratings 🤔
 Giga chad#0085: I have 1 get even more destroyed
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: I have 1 follower. 19 views, 15 downloads, 2 ratings, 1 comment. In retrospect, maybe I should have sacrificed the slight visual fidelity of Godot 4 and just stuck with 3. That way, I could have made a web build.
 Pixstatic#3464: I have 4, get destroyed
 tinderet#7708: I have one and they are the bravest warrior alive
 Fusoy#6101: I have 2 ratings, but I really don't have time to promote my magnificent game 🥲
 BadPiggy#5202: I'm greatful that anyone thought my games were good enough to follow lol
 Shimp#0064: I got 13 views and 6 downloads, im breaking my records so far)
 BlankSlate#8922: I have 32 views and 12 browser plays so far
 Digitaldude555#5515: I have 3 followers...
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: I have 25 and I'm grateful to all of them
 Giga chad#0085: no U can play it like yesterday I had like 6 view lol now 18
 Santia#2861: daaaamn nice thats sick lol
 q1#3172: ive seen a lot of poetry games that are very simple. the bitsy community has a ton of those. a lot of them are these simple, short and sweet experiences. and turning a poem into a space gives it a different dimension.
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: Yeah that's another thing. I don't have many followers, so my game is... not very visible.
 theChief#0001: Congrats xD
 theChief#0001: Damn, wow
 BadPiggy#5202: 1.2k
Not only from this jam lol
 HI I'M VMAR!!™#4288: OH NO, IM LATE FOR WORK
 Digitaldude555#5515: they probably took some assets from asset store
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: Step 1) did you delete the game files and no one can actually play it if so you're re screwed
Step 2) plug your game in review your game
Step 3) play other games and comment on them when rating so they see your game and play it
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: This is fair. Different contexts matter and it'd be imperfect. But I'm sure it's possible. I mean, you could even have some system to make players critique each other's poems.
Kinda like "Kind Words," if you've ever heard of it.
 SLiV#5820: Same, presentation was always my weakspot and in the last jam I did I managed to get #1 presentation with my own art, so really happy with that. This jam I'm probably going to get #6200 for fun though haha
 theChief#0001: You've managed a massive amount of ratings too 😂 how many followers you got on itch now?
 MrBen#0001: bruh how someone's unity game can be 800 mb lol
 Jasper#7906: I want to fix my bugs... (and then of course not publish the fixes for a week). But also, I should really work on my itch page. And you know, catch up on life (including some important mortgage stuff...)
 Mark Brown#6982: No you slept for a month, we're on day 35
 BadPiggy#5202: Yup lol. He makes some good stuff
 Digitaldude555#5515: most rated game has 400 votes?? and it was made a highschooler that crazy
 HI I'M VMAR!!™#4288: We’re still on day one yes
 Giga chad#0085: bro ur lucky as hell man yesterday till now 15 views
 oa#7680: this is all possible, apart from the mood association. and mood association changes depending on the combination. until an ai can perfectly replicate human emotions, that is impossible.
 Santia#2861: because it's been like 13-14h after deadline and there are 6k submissions, it will take people time to find your game at all lol
 Shimp#0064: I envy you for that lol
 BadPiggy#5202: F
 theChief#0001: Not til mark does his video in a couple of weeks!
 MrBen#0001: man the ratings go brrr. Every 1 minute I refresh the page there r 100 new reviews lol
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: Not initially, but hear me out...
A bunch of word tiles, each with a specified syllable count, rhyme group, mood association, etc. You can place them in orders or maybe fit them into frameworks, and then have systems to calculate whether it follows those rules. Whether the mood is consistent, the rhythm works, it rhymes.
 HI I'M VMAR!!™#4288: Are you able to you the ratings of your game?
 Giga chad#0085: bro why is no one voting my game bruh
 theChief#0001: Ah I remember this feeling 😂
 Santia#2861: I still have not found where you can actually see the ratings lmao
 BlankSlate#8922: I personally like the ratings and feedback since it lets me know what areas of game development I need to improve on
 Santia#2861: Some friends speedran our game and like it, that's all I care about.
Even if one level design mistake and one wrong voice acting line made it in which will annoy me for eternity lmao
 MrBen#0001: yep that's true
 BlankSlate#8922: Aye that's really good to hear I got 7 ratings so far
 q1#3172: ratings are a part of game jam culture that i dont like, too much focus on numbers. its cool that it encourages people to play each others games tho
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: Same. Like, I'm trying to publicize for feedback and learning, but just the fact that... I finished a game. And I feel good about the finished product, and all the little details and stuff I put in.
 MrBen#0001: lmao bet
 oa#7680: essentially, because of prosody, it would be incredibly complicated to have any sort of interactivity.
prosody refers to the systems and rythms of poetry. this needs to be very, very carefully done and specific "feet"  produce specific emotions in specific combinations.
having a system that would
1. make poetry that makes sense
2. use prosody
3. be interactive
would be practically impossible to code.
 Saxophone Siphonophore#1485: Clearly, if Mark *truly* cared for the craft he would play every single game from all the GMTK Game Jams until he's mastered every single one
 MrBen#0001: man, I got 20 ratings thats sick! And 70 downloads 🍩
 BlankSlate#8922: Same
 Santia#2861: screw the ratings I'm just happy to have made a functioning game lmao
 MrBen#0001: true
 Kritical#4329: he plays top 100 to get the top 20 for the video
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: Because he plays the top 100 for the end of jam video right
 BadPiggy#5202: I'm talking about the results lol
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: Where has this 'top 100' games thing come from? Mark plays games submitted on a google form, he's never done the top 100 games in a stream before
 q1#3172: woah thats crazy cool that you repurposed it like that
 Cameron#7818: Isn't that number specifically chosen so that Mark does not die of video game overdose?
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: Okay, but like... why not? Why not make a game that *is* a poem, or a poem that *is* a game? There are no rules for non-jam games, go crazy!
 BlankSlate#8922: Weird creatures sleeping as pfps are the superior choice to everything else let's be real
 HI I'M VMAR!!™#4288: The last few days feel like a blur. We all gathered in a friends house and just worked on the game the entire time, didn’t even leave the building
 wren#0640: I'm probably gonna use my game as just something I can periodically add levels to when I have nothing to work on after the jam I think
 Shimp#0064: Honestly, same
 MrBen#0001: not mine for sure
 CraaazySteeeve#7242: 100 is already a LOT of work haha
 BlankSlate#8922: If people like my game I really want to expand it more
 oa#7680: sadly, poems aren't video games yet.
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: This is one of the main selling points of jams for me. The fact that you can start and finish something real small and that reminds you that yes, you can in fact make games.
 q1#3172: eyyy reactions are back
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: My guess is 1%
 BadPiggy#5202: Yo Mark
Will you be playing only from the top 100 this year ? Or would you consider increasing that number a little since there's more entries ?
 MrBen#0001: Honestly I love ur pfp 👀
 Cameron#7818: Also, yes, thanks Mark for running the jam!
 Shimp#0064: I wonder how many projects will evolve into full game after jam
 oa#7680: I might join in properly next year. though all of my team dropped out, I used some of the stuff I wrote for it to begin making a poem thing
 SLiV#5820: Yeah this was a lot of fun!
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: 'Twas a lovely jam, and I enjoyed the opportunity to make and complete something small!
 BlankSlate#8922: Honestly super grateful for this gamejam cause I was super burned out from making games for months but now I got my passion back
 MrBen#0001:
 wren#0640: wahoo
 MrBen#0001: haha
 mastace#2935: HELL YEAH! DM me the game, love your icon
 Clement Ribeyre-Soret#2835: I'd like to thank  and everyone involved in the organisation. This was a blast, just like last year's edition! Thanks for making this possible! 💟
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: Because less than a 3 means it's not even half good.
 HI I'M VMAR!!™#4288: Even had to do a last minute update because the music suddenly got messed up
 MrBen#0001: Thats my first **finished** gamejam
that im **happy** with
 BlankSlate#8922: Idk why but I find it so hard to rate anything lower than a 3
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: I would agree, but... there are games that involve dice, and then there are games where they literally just slap a dice skin or throw some dice props into an entirely unrelated game.
 SLiV#5820: Enjoyment 2/5
Creativity 5/5
Presentation 4/5
 Saxophone Siphonophore#1485: I see now the error of my ways.
 HI I'M VMAR!!™#4288: I’m just proud we actually got the game “finished” in time
 MrBen#0001: I mostly focused on the aesthetics and puzzles
 theChief#0001: Oh I completely agree! But what would be the point of a "theme" rating? You subverted expectations, in my experience that would have drastically pulled your "theme" rating down 😉
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: I'm honestly pretty proud of my game's main mechanic. In the future, for changing it, I think the main difference would be a little bit of visual polish and then a lot of more levels and maybe some new systems to interact with.
 wren#0640: I don't think any game can fit the theme *better* than another, the themes just meant as a jumping off point to make an interesting game
 Saxophone Siphonophore#1485: So I went ahead and rated that game more fairly now.
 quantum#0043: my game doesnt fit the theme that much
 hehe boi#3720: I think my game has a good mechanic but it needs tweaking so I might continue to work on it
 MrBen#0001: my game fits the theme but not so good as others lol
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: It's an interesting process of figuring out how to follow the theme while still subverting it. I had to think, "what are the defining features of dice?" One is that they're used for randomness, and another is that each side has a different number. I decided to focus on the latter while eliminating the former, to subvert the expectation of the player that it'd be RNG-based.
 Saxophone Siphonophore#1485: (I don't know how to spell it)
 Julien#2204: Just woke up, I'm gonna try out a bunch of submissions. Yesterday I was too tired 😩
DM me your games if you want some feedback!
 wren#0640: fowl like a bird
 Saxophone Siphonophore#1485: Oh, turns out my Itch.io app glitched and didn't send my rating. No harm no fowl, then.
 hehe boi#3720: I made the worst character controller
 Static doodles#2251: Literally just made a worse version of the miracle matter fight
 theChief#0001: Just because something is "normal" doesn't mean it's useful 😉
 Saxophone Siphonophore#1485: Hmm. I suppose you're right.
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: That's not what the creativity category is though surely? Why punish when doing so doesn't follow the rating criteria? You're not being asked to rate theme adherence
 theChief#0001: People tend to adhere to the theme anyway, better adherence to the theme doesn't make a better game - what would be the point of it?
 Static doodles#2251: Enjoyment 2/5
Creativity 2/5
Presentation 3/5
 VEE-TEE#9882: I have an issue with the game jam...
I submitted my game on time but I think I there was a problem with the upload so it turns out there was no game file just an empty page and now I can't upload the game because of the jam
Any help or I should just give up
 hehe boi#3720: I mean I'm happy I made a better ge in 2 days than one I made in 4 days
 wren#0640: I really hope my game doesn't lose points in creativity bc the dice mechanic only shows up in level 4 and level 3 is a slight difficulty spike so some people might miss it entirely
 DivineShadow777#9407: 3/5 Enjoy, 7/5 Creativity, Presentation 4/5
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: Creativity: 3/5
Presentation: 2/5
Enjoyment: 1/5
 prestonexists#9431: of course
 tinderet#7708: I think that’s a tough question because you have the disadvantage of knowing everything that you wanted to do with it past the 48 hour point, which can be detrimental to objectivity
 HI I'M VMAR!!™#4288: Our game leans heavily on presentation and creativity because we have hardly any gameplay
 Saxophone Siphonophore#1485: 6 Presentation, 7 Creativity, 100 Enjoyment
 MrBen#0001: Enjoyment 3/5
Creativity 4/5
Presentation 5/5
 hehe boi#3720: 1 pres, 4 creativity, 2 enjoyment
 Saxophone Siphonophore#1485: I feel like there should be an "adherence to theme" rating. I found a game that looked visually and audibly stunning, but didn't adhere to theme at all. Best I could do was rate Creativity a 1 star.
 wren#0640: question: what would you all give your own game if you could rate it
 hehe boi#3720: I've only got a tiny bit creativity lol
 HI I'M VMAR!!™#4288: Didn’t even know there weee multiple ratings
 hehe boi#3720: Aha thx
 Saxophone Siphonophore#1485: Enjoyment, Creativity, Presentation
 hehe boi#3720: Wait what are the ratings again? Creativity,
 Kritical#4329: me rn
 DivineShadow777#9407: I'm just happy I finished. I can think about ratings after I get some rest.
 tinderet#7708: That’s too bad…
 MrBen#0001: ID OD NDO DONT GET MANY RATIGN ARGGHHHHHHHH 💢😡😡
 MrBen#0001: true 📈
 theChief#0001: Also some people get real mad if they don't have many ratings
 Saxophone Siphonophore#1485: "And when everyone's 1 Star... no one is"
 HI I'M VMAR!!™#4288: I’d admire the dedication
 Merus#7019: Mark will play a bunch of games on stream, but he'll consider the top 100 for the final video
 theChief#0001: Bots are a thing xD
 MrBen#0001: imagine going through every game one by one and starring it 1 xD
 theChief#0001: Keep game links to  please.
 theChief#0001: However it's only true to a point - you still need more than the median number of ratings otherwise itch will lower your score
 RedTeapot#1960: Yeah, top 100 games
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: So surround yourself with yes men who will give you all fives /s
 CM69Time#0494: I was just reviewing this game. The music is cracking and it has one of the more original ideas.
 MrBen#0001: hmm true
 theChief#0001: I've done more than 100, this is what I see regularly 😉 if you've got fewer, higher quality ratings, of course you're going to do better than a game that sits at the top of "most rated" and gets a bunch of salty 1 star reviews, or people that played that don't understand the genre, etc etc etc
 Aeph#4622: but mark only plays the highest rated right?
 Saxophone Siphonophore#1485:  this channel doesn't have embeds. When you post a yt link, could you say what it links to first?
 Merus#7019: no, theChief is right - the more ratings, the more likely you'll attract people who don't like your game or are just voting 1
 RedTeapot#1960: Getting the highest overall score, I guess
 Saxophone Siphonophore#1485: Having your game featured in the highlight video, I presume.
 tinderet#7708: Yeah, it’s honestly the journey? I was really fulfilled by having a post-mortem on the experience with my team and hearing everyone talk about their lessons learned/positive experiences/goals for their next projects. We ended up with our UI designer determined to master unity to better understand HIS design process, I gained confidence in running a team, delegating tasks, and faith that people would enjoy my art in a game setting
 HI I'M VMAR!!™#4288: What does “win” mean in this context?
 MrBen#0001: I dont think so
 Aeph#4622: that makes no sense
 hoss#1671:  Silicon Crew roll out.
 theChief#0001: Also, generally in jams the more ratings you get, the _less_ likely you are to win
 MrBen#0001: wow
 Merus#7019: I'm giving my new computer a little trophy
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: Also if there was a rating to win wouldn't people just spam that
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: It's about getting experience, having fun, and learning. I post my game because I want feedback, not because I want to "win." I just want to see from as many perspectives as possible what I did right, what I did wrong, and how to make it better.
 Saxophone Siphonophore#1485: Even if you miss the deadline, you still participated. You still worked on a game.
 Merus#7019: there _is_ a trophy ceremony and a prize of a brand new M2 MacBook Air, with cake, but it's at my house, it's not related to the jam, and it's happening when I receive my new MacBook Air
 quantum#0043: 😪
 BricksParts#5032: ~~The real prize was the friends we made along the way~~
 Fraserfatt#1021: the real win was the friends we made along the way
 KaineShadory#1612: hahah wats with all the puns "Dice to meet you" "Dice try"
 Saxophone Siphonophore#1485: You "win" by participating.
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: It's not all about winning. It's about making a game.
 HI I'M VMAR!!™#4288: You win when you manage to submit on time
 quantum#0043:  wdym
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: ^
 Saxophone Siphonophore#1485: I don't think you should look at this through the lens of "winning".
 hoss#1671: My idea was to make a dice with each side representing a game modifier, however the idea was to allow the player to configure the sides, so they could customise the outlay of the game. Each side of the first die representing a weapon, each side of the second representing a game modifier. Technically, not numbers, but still technically dice.
 RedTeapot#1960: All fives of course
 Kritical#4329: thx ill just put it in the review channel
 quantum#0043:  what is the minimum rating to win
 hehe boi#3720: I'll rate your game this afternoon if you like!
 Saxophone Siphonophore#1485: If sticks can be die, magic 8 balls count too.
 tinderet#7708: Oh that’s sick
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: I played a great game which is about making dice but not rolling them and instead scoring what the sides are. Technically not "rolling the dice" but good enough fit for the theme for me
 Sappir#7051: I got my katamari dice idea too late
 tinderet#7708: Yeah. I honestly appreciate when people take some liberties with how they approach the theme but my brain still says ‘yeah, okay, I totally get how this links back, that’s clever!’
 Kritical#4329: i have 1 rating
 Saxophone Siphonophore#1485: But a dice is just an instrument to determine one of a set of random values.
Senet, one of the oldest board games in recorded history, uses two-sided sticks and those get classified as dice.
 Kritical#4329: a die is just a random number generator
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: Themes can be interpreted as you see fit. If rolling the dice to you is probability based games then that counts
 coconut_orange#3725: It's a D8 in magic water tho
 SableCanyon#3258: I have made 17 comment up to now and got 1 hahah
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: No, it's random but it's not dice. That's like asking if a deck of cards counts as dice.
 hehe boi#3720: I have 7 reviews, 4 comments
 Saxophone Siphonophore#1485: Here's a thought: does a magic 8 ball count as a dice?
 hehe boi#3720: Great. Thanks. I did worse on brackeys game jam lol
 syelan34#3258: i better up my game lol, I have 3 reviews so far
 BlankSlate#8922: 12
 syelan34#3258: I don't really know what they expected it's a game made in 2 days you can't go through all of that stuff to make sure it works great, as long as the concept is good then that's good enough for me
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: Better than one of my games this game jam. People don't like the mechanics *or* execution of mine!
Think about what things you implemented in your game this jam and what you achieved and be proud of that. Nice comments are good but not the be all end all
 SableCanyon#3258: How many games have you reviewed up to now ?
 hehe boi#3720: My movement is too slippery, too hard to get the dice I want, etc
 hehe boi#3720: I guess. They only like the mechanics and not the execution
 coconut_orange#3725: How bad are the consequences for reporting many games? I've reported like 7 or so. A few that didn't work, one that uses Skyrim sounds, one that is a Unity store tutorial flip. Stuff like that
 tinderet#7708: I get those too. But it’s okay! You made something and put it out into the world and that rules
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: They say any publicity is good publicity!
 syelan34#3258: my entire game looks like that
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: I was fortunate enough to have a simple enough puzzle mechanic to implement. Though I only really worked on the game for... I wanna say 25 out of the 48 hours available. Still, I managed to make a product I'm proud of.
 hehe boi#3720: I have a lot of annoyed comments on mine :(
 syelan34#3258: hmm ok
 quantum#0043:  it is a joke just brighten the colours, currently a 5-6/10
 syelan34#3258: see i don't know if this is a joke but i'll assume it is
 quantum#0043: 0/10
 coconut_orange#3725: We could have spent all 48+ hours just prototyping a puzzle game
 Merus#7019: yes, he will
 LOPSTERu#3902: man puzzle games are hard
 MrBen#0001: yooo I have 16 reviews O_o
 wastedfox#0295:  I probably missed it but still... Do you play submitted games before the Top-100 are revealed to you?
 Aeph#4622: sure two seconds
 quantum#0043: Please check out "Roller Coaster".
 mastace#2935:  Check out "Odd Weather Today" be meeeeeee
 RedSantar#0027: perfect
 Lukey#6052: Yup, as long as you don't touch the builds section you should be fine
 Aeph#4622: ah yes i saw, thank you!
 RedSantar#0027: i uploaded my cover and my screenshots today (few minutes ago), is okay right?
 mastace#2935: I popped a comment on8 the page!
 coconut_orange#3725: Same! And I try to be positive and constructive
 syelan34#3258: I have 8 ratings but only 2 comments, I still need to get more reviews done
 Kritical#4329: i try to comment and give feedback on almost all the games i play
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: Good point. If ratings aren't visible then I'll definitely need to do more commenting.
 Koolento#6688: Hey if you want more comments, be sure to comment on other peoples games! So that way you get noticed more easily by both the creator and people reading your comment
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: We who only have downloads thank you for your service.
 SableCanyon#3258: I making my reviews in that way too.
 Jerry#0485: Lol, I got only 3 reviews XD
 Aeph#4622: any feedback?
 coconut_orange#3725: Since I saw everyone was focusing on web games, I went the opposite and focused on download games, all of which need reviewers
 BadPiggy#5202: I have more browser plays than downloads so yup
I always download the ones which I really like though lol
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: Got Linux and Windows builds though.
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: That's probably where mine suffers. It's download-only. Godot 4 doesn't have web builds yet.
 Aeph#4622: Exactly I agree
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: People dont like downloading games in my experience so it's harder to get ratings on them
 Aeph#4622: I think browser projects are more popular than downloadables if you want to quickly play
 mastace#2935: still playin yah
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: Mhm! Most likely gonna work on more stuff together in the future, which should be fun!
 tinderet#7708: It’s so nice when you can work on stuff together like that 🙂
 mastace#2935:  ooh browser
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: Was definitely a fun jam though. My girlfriend pitched in with some puzzle design which was really cool! We'll probably work on adding more stuff after the jam, too.
 mastace#2935: yes
 coconut_orange#3725: I'll post a link in the review channel
 Merus#7019: check out  to find games to review
 quantum#0043: yeah my projects name is Roller Coaster. Please check it out
 tinderet#7708: Will do!
 Aeph#4622: If you would be so kind as to check out my project, Yahtzee vs Chess! then I’d greatly appreciate it Ty
 mastace#2935: what is your project?
 Merus#7019: that's what karma is for!
 tinderet#7708: Maybe! It depends on how we feel about it. We had a lot of ideas to push the concept that weren’t in a reasonable scope of what our end goals were (one super polished game, we ran into problems last year with lots of bugs from too ambitious of scope)
 quantum#0043:  really?
 coconut_orange#3725: We have plans to make ours a little more complete for sure
We have good code and a good engine, we'd just love to add more content like we wanted and get through our backlog
 Mark Brown#6982: The countdown videos are produced by YouTube, I'm afraid, so I don't know
 Merus#7019: reviewing other games will improve your karma, which will put your game in front of more people
 Aeph#4622: Me too! But at least it was fun
 tykenn#8548: Yeah, I've gotten only one comment so far, and I'm not sure if it was a compliment or an insult, so I'm just sitting here hoping the game is actually working for people.
 mastace#2935: anyone want me to lok at anything, I got time to kill and I want to see stuff
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: Yeah, I'm gonna post it in  if anybody wants to check it out. And if you recognize it but not from this account, then it was probably from my alt account, Syntaxxor.
 quantum#0043: anyone else who will update their game after the jam
 subwave [Rolling Dice]#0193:  what was the music used for the countdown video for the premiere? I cant seem to locate it.
 Mother_of_Steel#3868: Absolutly (this is my 8th)
Just play others game and give the helpfull feedback you wish to get on your games
 coconut_orange#3725: That's the worst! For us, the comments mean more because they're more directed than just how a reviewer feels about your game at that particular moment regarding creativity and such
 mastace#2935: I will check it out
 MaverickHorn#2838: It will be visible after marks result video is published. Before that, there is no way to see the ratings
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: I have gotten 0 comments.
 coconut_orange#3725: Are you getting good comments?
 Aeph#4622: I don’t believe you can see individual reviews
 mastace#2935:  what is your game?
 Princess Rhapsody#6732: Question: How do I know if I'm getting good reviews? My game only has one rating and I can't even see what the rating says about it.
 yumaikas#3530: It's too late to change it now, but I do a web build most of the time, and if I have time, other versions, unless I'm working with a framework or engine that doesn't allow for ir
 coconut_orange#3725: People don't want to mess with downloading and installing something, and the headaches that can come from it not being compatible with your system
 MaverickHorn#2838: you can't overestimate that
 Chowdog 宗翰#0135: People are more willing to play web version tho
 syelan34#3258: I mean the number of ratings you have isn't necessarily that important, as long as you have good reviews you're doing good
 SableCanyon#3258: Is publishing web build that important, because most of the people play web builds i guess ?
 Chowdog 宗翰#0135: Hey I still got some free time,  just give a dm, we can exchange reviews
 mastace#2935: I banged mine out fast and dont expect much but its always fun to do it
 Mother_of_Steel#3868: 😉 only 6000 games to compete with...
It is hard
 coconut_orange#3725: Oh thanks! We have 7!!
I’d appreciate any feedback 🙂
 RedTeapot#1960: You just open the game's jam page, it's on the top right
 Vanisher#8393: couldnt agree with this more, its weird cuz theres a good chance to have a lot of ratings mess up ur overall score
 wren#0640: its really weird seeing my game get rated so much when last time i did a jam i clawed my way to 81 ratings by spamming it in the review channel any chance i got
 tinderet#7708: If anyone has a game to be played feel free to DM em to me! I’ll have to wake up tomorrow and play them but I’ll add them to the ratings queue
 coconut_orange#3725: How do you see how many ratings you have on your game?
 quantum#0043: my game has a lot of bugs lmao
 BluebsTopCat#3141: 100%
 tinderet#7708: Honestly getting up the nerve to make and submit something is half the battle and everyone should be proud of themselves for showing the world a thing they made
 BlankSlate#8922: My game is at 6 ratings
 Aeph#4622: I’m only at 6 also, but I’m happy I participated because this was my first jam
 yumaikas#3530: Heh, fair enough. There are definitely broken parts of this game, heh
 NotExplosive#0002: that nice of you but I'm not worried-- this is like my 20th game jam, i'm just here to have a good time 🙂
 NotExplosive#0002: Oh I see-- speaking from experience I don't think that really happens. If a game gets a _ton_ of ratings it's usually because people really liked it, told their friends about it, then their friends rated it too. the feedback loop is only positive
 dardasaba#9759: Oof that's sad :(
Don't worry, after I eat breakfast and stuff I'm gonna grind playing and rating submissions, maybe I'll also play yours ;)
 dardasaba#9759: At this rate, this game made in 48 hours is gonna be more successful than all my other games (made in weeks and months) put together xD
 yumaikas#3530: No, that I'll end up with, like too many ratings and get a crowd of negative ones at some point, lol
 CyberWitch#3879: Damn.  I missed a single line of code so my game only increases the difficulty once then just stops 😦
 NotExplosive#0002: I'm at 2 ratings, you're doing fine 🙂
 Omegnight#7081: That's way more than the current average !
 BluebsTopCat#3141: congrats!
 yumaikas#3530: That my game is at 17 ratings already gives me some concerns, tbh
 tinderet#7708: That rules! Congrats!
 dardasaba#9759: So uh I just woke up, looked at my analytics for the gmtk game I uploaded yesterday... 100+ plays, 72 jam ratings, and 25 very positive comments :D
You guys are insane xD
 wastedfox#0295: Does anyone know if Mark plays the submitted games before the top 100 is determined?
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: As someone who has hustled in the past to get 100+ ratings on my game: it's not worth it. You only need more than the median number of ratings (normally about 20) and then you are good.
 tinderet#7708: Thank you! It was my first time art directing a team and by the end when everyone said they were super happy, didn’t feel overworked and we made something we liked it was all worth it
 coconut_orange#3725: Thank you!
 MrRedShark77#2280: Yes I think I spam every game, just imagine! I hate what my game is unpopular, please help me get good popular
 PickleOstrich#2216: Thank you
 RedTeapot#1960: It starts on 25 July. You can find the Discord invite in   (called Post Jam Productions)
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: Click on submissions and there's a "games in need of ratings" near the top. It updates as the ratings period progresses
 yumaikas#3530: Managing 11 people in a Jam situation is impressive, I'll say.
If it wasn't for a year, I'd like to try to join, lol
 coconut_orange#3725: Ah thank you! I'll look again
 PickleOstrich#2216: Wait when does that take place and where
 Cameron#7818: Left sidebar, sort by -> least rated
 tinderet#7708: Nope! Just wannabes hahaha
 coconut_orange#3725: On itch, I see there's a way to see games with no views or votes. Is there a way to see ones that have a very small amount once those are all viewed and rated?
 Cameron#7818: Wait, what? Did you link to the wrong channel?
 Beeg scarf#3571: Its on 
 coconut_orange#3725: With 1 exception, I've been trying to leave positive and good feedback for everyone's game that I've played
 mickychin#7933: ok ill delete it. it just the gamejam name is 18+ sooo idk.
 Prine#6562: I need to know how to add audio in twine, it's so complicated
 AppLaGee#5373: Well, idk about y'all, but I am *beat.* I gotta go sleep urgently, lol. I hope everyone has an awesome day, and good luck in the ratings!
 Prine#6562: Built different
 Cameron#7818: You can't send pictures in here, no. (or at least non-patreons can't, I think.)
 RedTeapot#1960: Yeah exactly
 coconut_orange#3725: I would love to fix one bug that's been bothering me about my game
 Zutilt10 | Jonathan. W#0339: How's everyone's game doing?
 yumaikas#3530: I think it's on the itch jam calendar?
 mickychin#7933: can someone check the picture I send in  I didn't know is the allow or not and I cant send picture here
 Beeg scarf#3571: Quick! Shill post jam productions
 Prine#6562: I'd join that
 Cameron#7818: I don't have a link, I just hear about quite often.
 Ahnaf30e#3408: ello amigos, how ya doin?
 yumaikas#3530: That sounds like a good system. Y'all do this for a job, I take it?
 Prine#6562: Ooh, someone post a link somewhere
 Scolon#4218: Eat your game jam jam
 RedTeapot#1960: Yeah, we do the post-jam jam
 Cameron#7818: "Improve your Game Jam" is indeed a game jam.
 yumaikas#3530: It's for 2D walking Sims with little bits of inventory. It's kinda cool, tbh
 wren#0640: i think someone does do a post gmtk finsh your games jam
 Prine#6562: There should be like a GMTK redemption jam, you get 1 hour to post your project if you couldn't like a week from now or something
 Mother_of_Steel#3868: Bitsy????? I do not that one!!!
 RedTeapot#1960: Or get lucky with early promotion kek
 tinderet#7708: Honestly? I'm just really fast at pumping out art & making sure  everyone else on the team plays to their strengths and keeps motivated. Our first brainstorming session we kept streamlined & made sure we had an idea with a vision, spent about 20 minutes on moodboarding, and then got to work. Our programmers made the framework so we were able to drop in assets as they got delivered, and our UI guy bounced between the art and programming teams so that we knew how players needed to interact with the game
 Cameron#7818: One thing that helps is playing other people's games and leaving comments on their jam pages. I go through my comments and play the game of everyone in there.
 BlankSlate#8922: Best way to get attention to your game is to give attention to other games
 Mother_of_Steel#3868: You could also play other games and comment ;)
 yumaikas#3530: Fair. That and Bitsy (even more minimal) would be interesting challenges, though Bitsy at least can turn into a hot mess of hacking around limitations by doing lots of exits
 Prine#6562: So many AAA style games couldn't make it on time
 MrRedShark77#2280: I hate it when my good game doesn't go popular, never visit, ignore! Please play Endless Dice, be honest
 Mother_of_Steel#3868: Fair ;)
I did not to many jams on it, but those I did I really enjoyed the simplicity when compared to my unity jams ;)
 RedTeapot#1960: Haha same. Also, the uploads on the Edit page
 yumaikas#3530: That's intense, lol. How did you manage making sure the assets came without costing a lot of time getting them in-game?
 BluebsTopCat#3141: ooh, neat
 Cameron#7818: God, every time I'm on the itch page for my game and see the 'Remove this submission' button I get the existential fear that I might accidently click it.
 tinderet#7708: I'll DM you, but it was a dice-based RPG with a cartoony/anime 2d look & 3d dice elemental combat system.
 Kritical#4329: i worked with a team of 1 and cooperating with myself is harder than with a team
 LOPSTERu#3902: ours was 1 lol
 yumaikas#3530: Pico 8 is *too* small for my tastes, lol. I'd got Tic-80 for a virtual console like that
 AppLaGee#5373: Woooah, 11! Ours was 3, lol, that's super cool
 BluebsTopCat#3141: which project was yours? that sounds like a huge number
 Mother_of_Steel#3868: I know it gets insane :D
 tinderet#7708: We worked with a team of 11 this year and a big part was delegation. We had the head programmer delegate/run meetings and I ran all art/sound/etc while also doing most of the art assets, ran meetings every few hours of each day to make sure we were all on the same page & had our deliverables, and made sure everyone had assigned tasks.
 Scolon#4218: I'll never be able to work in a team in a jam scenario, I'd just have conflicting ideas with everyone xd
 yumaikas#3530: Mine was a round of Samwise Gamgee vs an orc, and it was supposed to be two attacks, but it didn't validate the number you put in, so my brother types in 20 or something, and killed the orc on one hit.
Good times
 Mother_of_Steel#3868: Hello I am saturn91 and I would like to talk about pico8 to you :D
Export takes like 1s and upload as well
 BluebsTopCat#3141: you've almost convinced me to switch, wow. I don't want to loose my engine experience, but godot has looked better every day, especially with the buyout stuff.
 nicholas#8278: webgl can be a bit buggy sometimes
 Cameron#7818: I could (and have) seen good games made by more than 3 people in a jam. Though the one that I remember had one person dedicated to managing everyone, which is probably essential for team sizes of over 4.
 Scolon#4218: Unity is supposedly working on a replacement for webgl but alas
 tinderet#7708: We had a lot of bugs with our game's sound in WebGL, but luckily we were able to overcome the issues with it and it loads pretty quickly in-browser. It was interesting to try to figure out that one
 BluebsTopCat#3141: I just solo dev and suck at everything until I eventually don't. for my game I did the art, music, programming, and designing
 LTCat#9725: WebGL just broke my game :(
 yumaikas#3530: Meanwhile Godot web builds are small enough that I uploaded mine 5 times in the last half hour :D
 Mother_of_Steel#3868: absolutly and never join a jam team bigger than 3 unmanagable 😋
 Scolon#4218: Unity WebGL needs a lot od improvements yeah
 Cameron#7818: ~~rename your game to " (POST YOUR SCORES IN THE COMMENTS)"~~
 AppLaGee#5373: I still remember my first project, it was a text-based number guessing game in Python, but MAN it really was the catylist for my wanting to game dev
 BluebsTopCat#3141: unitys webgl setup is awful, terrible, nonfunctional, and I wouldn't have it any other way
 coolhotdogguy#4788: I did try that actually. I don't think a single person read it lol
 Nobody6502#8971: Yeah…
 sharmashish#0895: Does brackeys videos count as prior experience 😁
 BluebsTopCat#3141: wow, it must have been super busy
 Cameron#7818: Yea, other people can be both helpful and detrimental.
If it goes well, you're all keeping each other on track and productive.
If it doesn't you go in the exact opposite direction.
 BadPiggy#5202: ( oinks in shorter delay )
 nicholas#8278: yay
 Mark Brown#6982: I've reduced slow mode to 30 seconds, now that the madness of last night has died down! ⏰
 yumaikas#3530: We all start somewhere. My first program was a text based RPG combat round in QBasic, but in 2007 because I was retro then
 BluebsTopCat#3141: rip
 AppLaGee#5373: Ayoooo, that's what we're talking about
~~i have no idea why i replied to myself there, haha~~
 BluebsTopCat#3141: bold of you to assume I have prior experience 😎
 wastedfox#0295: start a Reddit thread with your friends and tags for the Jam. I would ran some games this way just for competing and fun
 Cameron#7818: A note in the description maybe?
 yumaikas#3530: I've gotten better at avoiding that over the years, heh. Though I still have some cringe bits this year, around levels especially.
 I think having a creative partner to talk about it too, if they aren't also trying to overscope it, can be helpful.
 Tyler Hunter#0474: The choices are driven by dice.  It’s experimental.  I’ll admit that.  Killing the priest prevents the good ending :/
 coolhotdogguy#4788: What do you all think might be good ways to get people to share their high scores?
 Cameron#7818: Definitely. "Oh, I have all the time in the world for this and no deadline?" *proceeds to not do any meaningful progress on it at all while thinking about how cool it'll be one day*
 AppLaGee#5373: Man, everyone else is talking about their prior experience in programming, and im here like, "yes i took AP Comp Sci in high school, and one college intro to programming class" Little fish, big pond sort of deal, lol
 sharmashish#0895: Ah okay, thanks
 BluebsTopCat#3141: you can, but they need to review 10 random games first
 sharmashish#0895: Can i get people who have not participated in the jam to play and rate games ? Like games that i liked and want them to try ?
 yumaikas#3530: I was mostly backend/full stack, and then switched to FE for my current role.
Having ADHD means that I like variety.
I need to ship my vector editor, lol. I used it for one jam, and I have another game I need to try to finish, heh. But non-jam games are much slower going, especially because it's easy to scope just a bit higher
 SableCanyon#3258:  Haha I had to kill the priest idk why and they killed me nice story driven game buddy!
 AppLaGee#5373: I just know im gonna look back on this game code and cringe
 Prine#6562: This year the puzzle games are pretty good
 Tyler Hunter#0474: Review trade? Pm your link.
 Cameron#7818: Yea. I mostly do web and backend related stuff in my own time nowadays. Just getting to make a game is indeed a nice change of pace.
Cause when I make a game in my free time I overscope like hell, then work on it for about a week or two before it's left to rot in my ``Project Files`` folder.
 yumaikas#3530: Strangely, I feel less dead than I did last year (28 atm).
 Scolon#4218: Ill do this review trade thing tomorrow
Starting with every single person who commented on my game, for now, I'm going to sleep
 Fusoy#6101: Haha, I feel the same and i'm only 29 😅
 yumaikas#3530: I've done Jams in Love2D, Raylib and Godot.
Outside of Jams, I have some Pygame, and assorted WPF and WinForms shenanigans.
I work as a webdev fory day job, so games are a nice change of pace
 Tyler Hunter#0474: Thanks.  I almost died making it.  Too old for this stuff.  Like seriously.  I’m 40.  I can’t pull 40 hours of work in 2 days anymore
 PickleOstrich#2216: If anyone wants to trade games to play tomorrow just dm me your link and I’ll play it in the morning
 Cameron#7818: Would've been an absolutely cursed combination to have all those in one thing, let alone a game jam game.
The more I think about it, the more awful it gets.
 SableCanyon#3258: Found it! thank you
 Fusoy#6101:  I have just reviewed yours, you'll find my game under my comment
 Sappir#7051: You go to your submission page.
 AppLaGee#5373: 0, lol, that is to be expected in a pool of 6k
 yumaikas#3530: ~~That's an interesting combination~~ ah
 Scolon#4218: Oh yeah how many collections have you guys been added to so far
 Cameron#7818: java, SDL2, and js/html/css.
 Aqua_Coder0010#2146: Did you use SFML orrr SDL2?
 SableCanyon#3258: How can you see your vote number ?
 Tyler Hunter#0474: My inspiration was weirdly Reigns but it wound up being a weird kinda Shadow Gate thing.
 AppLaGee#5373: ~~and i know nothing about moonlighter, lmao~~
 Scolon#4218: U also get karma from playing and rating which will make your game appear more
 Sappir#7051: I have like 3 votes and two comments so....
 q1#3172: if u rate and review more games ull probably get some more visibility, sometimes ill see a game in the comments of another that i end up playing
 SAFT_Morlol#2702: There are like more than 6k to play so that’s normal
 Cameron#7818: No engine can work. I've gone without one for the last 5 years.
 Aqua_Coder0010#2146: The code was spagetii and the game is like 45% finished
 Tyler Hunter#0474: Shameless review trade plug again.  Feel free to pm me.
 AppLaGee#5373: Enter the Gungeon and Moonlighter was our team's big inspiration sources for this one
 Scolon#4218: Did you atleast make something
 nicholas#8278: did you not even make a game first
 SableCanyon#3258: I feel like no one plays my game, is that happens to you guys too ?
 Aqua_Coder0010#2146: I was so full of myself that I tried to submit the game jam without using a game engine
 yumaikas#3530: Yeah, that's aspect seems better left to one person, IMO? Voting for themes can be kinda wonky/memeish.
 Dicey Dungeons definitely was a small inspiration to my entry, though only a little.
Some of it just came from thinking about how TTRPGs use dice, lol
 wren#0640: you can set the embed window resolution in itch game settings if thats whats causing the issue
 AppLaGee#5373: Dicey Dungeons? Man, good thing my friends and I changed our game's name at the last minute, lmao
 q1#3172: yeahh!! i think my partner was afraid the theme would result in a lot of similar games but so far ive seen a lot of variety
 Cameron#7818: R.I.P, the Diceologer enemy that I wanted in my game. :(
 nicholas#8278: unity moment (not saying its a bad game engine)
 Scolon#4218: Diceologist
 Tyler Hunter#0474: I swear this theme came from Mark playing Dicey Dungeons alone.  Fair enough.  I can’t gush enough about that game.
 Aqua_Coder0010#2146: when will it start tho?
 Cameron#7818: Honestly, this year's theme was one of the easier ones.
Like, the older ones made it hard to come up with something good, this one was just "Haha, dice go brrr" and there was your game, lol.
 AppLaGee#5373: Friend and i went through all the themes and chose one at random as practice and made.... something, lol, and also I've been interested in Ludum Dare. Heard about it before gmtk jam, but never done it
 q1#3172: i agree, ludum dare is also more involved cuz people can vote for themes and stuff
 Ethereal Eye#8023: What's it called now?
 Nobody6502#8971: unity webgl why must you hurt me so 😦
I just want to play games, not have them be the wrong scaling
 Scolon#4218: My game was originally gonna be called 'Hellhole' but i renamed last minute because I couldn't finish the bullet hell aspect xd
 yumaikas#3530: Yeah. For me, GMTK replaced Ludum Dare, mostly because around LD 38 or so, the server for LD was going through The Change to the new one, and was a hot mess. I lapsed due to personal stuff, and doing 48 hour jams 3 times year just sounds exhausting.
 wren#0640: i thought i was so fucked when i heard the theme for the first time ngl
 Ethereal Eye#8023: Ngl when I get the prompt, my brain immediately goes to puns and works backward from there 😂
 Scolon#4218: Ye i've done ludum dare a few times
 Tyler Hunter#0474: Please review it.
 Cameron#7818: I know that there was one guy in VC who spent the weekend writing like 40 death scenes so I assume that one might be narrative.
 Since 2018. And I've participated in every single one ever since.
 Testman MK Ultra infiltrates the League of Shadows IN SPACE 
Also, 1 minute message cooldown is brutal
 q1#3172: i imagine a lot of gmtk jammers are also ludum dare jammers
 AppLaGee#5373: Yep
 yumaikas#3530: Haven't they been happening since 2017 or so? 2020 was my first GMTK jam.
 Scolon#4218: So many puns lmao
 Tyler Hunter#0474: It’s called Fated to Die
 SpruceStudios#3210: What's the game called?
 Tyler Hunter#0474: I’ll post the link to mine in the review thread it’s a narrative one.
 AppLaGee#5373: Oh, how long have you been in the gmtk jams?
 yumaikas#3530: Dang, you got a lot of things in place!
Yeah. Live and learn. Having an artist helping drive the visual style was super helpful tho
 Scolon#4218: Wait there are some narratives in here?
 noidstruct#4545: My game was gonna have a story cutscene but we ran out of time so we had to cut it out
 Fusoy#6101: It's called "DEE n DESK"
 tykenn#8548: Yeah, I'm gonna need some names of these narrative games so I can find them
 Cameron#7818: Pure javascript/html/css. And I was the artist an programmer. (no sound in my game though)
And yea, I can imagine how having the artist slice things up into a grid could massively speed stuff up.
 Tyler Hunter#0474: I made one :/
 Scolon#4218: I skipped out on the 2021 jam, iirc i got hyped and then just immediately burned out for no reason
 q1#3172: woah, which one are you talking about?
 Fusoy#6101: I have just played the first narrative game of this year. These are so rare !
 yumaikas#3530: Out of Control, and my entry was also overscoped then, lol
2021 was "Joined Together"
 cathy#3897: this is my first jam but honestly im quite proud of the work our team did
 noidstruct#4545: This is my first jam ever and im excited that i even managed to get a game out
 RedTeapot#1960: Out of Control
 q1#3172: this is also the first year i collabed :) very fun and def takes a load off knowing i dont have to do everything
 Herweins#2336: Only one? I think?
 wren#0640: can you send me your game? im always looking for more to rate
 Scolon#4218: Yeah I can see my progress as a developer from these jam games, they're really good for that. Harder to see how mucn you've improved with larger projects
 Cameron#7818: What was the 2020 theme again?
 yumaikas#3530: What did you build all that in?
For me, having art freed up a lot of time to focus on code, except that I struggled with it not being sliced out. I'll be asking for pre-sliced art, or a grid next time I work with an artist, just to make things easier to pull in
 coolhotdogguy#4788: Congratulations! I'm in the same boat!
 q1#3172: same actually, 2020 was a weird year. i finished, but was so unhappy with it at the time. looking back i think its cool to see the progression
 Scolon#4218: My 2020 entry was also kinda bleh, surprised it did decently
 yumaikas#3530: That's always a cool milestone to hit! I think I started hitting that around GMTK 2021? My 2020 entry was hot garbage, lol
 coolhotdogguy#4788: I started thinking about a die the bounces, then ,similar to yumaikas, basically copied doodle jump, then tweaked it.
 Cameron#7818: I also just inventoried my game: 11 characters, 18 items, 11 battles, a combat and an inventory system. Though none of them have a lot of animations.
 hamboy#0394: I wish that were me
 wren#0640: tbh i think this jam i made the first game ive ever actually been proud of?
 yumaikas#3530: I cribbed half of my mechanics from PvZ, and the other half from my experience in RPGs/dicey dungeons? And I had teammates to bounce off of, one of who drove most of the decisions around the look of the game
Also practice, lol
 hamboy#0394: Most def
 Herweins#2336:  nah they're wizard you can't change my mind
 Shimp#0064: Same, after first reviews ideas flooded me, since i now understand what people enjoyed and what not
 piethedestroyer#3192: how do y'all come up with ideas in such a short period of time?
 hamboy#0394: They probably know fast tricks for fast iteration, I'd like to know how thet do it
 Scolon#4218: Im also slowly realizing design choices i couldve made
 Cameron#7818: God, I just realized: I should've given the enemies in my game items more often.
Would've made for a more interesting game later on instead of just having more enemies.
 yumaikas#3530: I didn't realize how much stuff it was until I sat down to inventory it.
Granted, some bits of that  are kinda buggy. The sort of thing that you could clean up after some rest.
GMTK 2020 got me back into jamming after a hiatus, heh
 coolhotdogguy#4788: My first game jam was the GMTK 2020 which was also actually my first game. Such a rewarding process then at is now. And this time I actually have a game I'm proud of!
 hamboy#0394: Game dev speedrunners
 Herweins#2336: I'm scared to see the top rank games people made in 2 days. Last year just blew my mind... some of them could already be called kickstarter demo or something.
 coolhotdogguy#4788: That's so much stuff! I'm impressed you were able to do so much! I have 0 animations in mine but funny enough also had 2 sounds people.
 Whim#5465: Hi, I'm Whim I run a casual stream on twitch... More importantly i spent 4.5 yrs as a game test lead on the 360
 yumaikas#3530: I was code, I had one artist, and two guys doing sounds
The art guy did a lot too
 cathy#3897: wait no theyre open im confused now
 Cameron#7818: On your own or in a team?
 Scolon#4218: I am underscoping all future jams i participate in after this xd
 hamboy#0394: Small scope
 yumaikas#3530: I had.... Two interacting inventory systems, 6 enemies, with at least 3 animations per enemy, 6 types of gadgets to stop them (some explosive, one projectile, two walls and a flamethrower), visualized dice rolls, 2D lighting, a music manager, and dice rolls feeding into things and a progress map.
All in 48 hours. No wonder I'm tired, lol
 Cameron#7818: This is how I felt when I first did this jam some years ago.
Am happy to see that it's still that way for new people.
 cathy#3897: oh what i dont remember doing that
 AppLaGee#5373: can I just say though, I loved this year's theme! The second I saw dice I immediately just lit up. I love dice and cards and the sort of aesthetic it brings to mind.
 Merus#7019: the Indiepocalypse
 CraaazySteeeve#7242: your DM's are friends only btw
 nicholas#8278: one. single. jam.
and over 6000 games have been made all around a specific theme
thats... a lot of games!
 Merus#7019: we're erring on the side of assuming it is unless context makes it clear that it's not
 Merus#7019: we don't really have the bandwidth to evaluate whether a game being linked is or is not the poster's
 RedTeapot#1960: And it's just for this jam
 cathy#3897: if anyone wants to game swap dm me :v
 Herweins#2336: I can't imagine 6k game tbh. It's more games than I will ever play in my life.
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: (i know, i was a contributor, i had to do it)
 yumaikas#3530: Does it do a lot of different mechanics?
Also, some mechanics are much easier than others.
Godot, for example, doesn't have an intuitive hitbox/hurtbox setup, especially if you want more than one Area2D, and that cost me a lot of time on bugs
 Nobody6502#8971: 😳
 CraaazySteeeve#7242: yeah but someone who doesn't have skin in the game can just rate them all however they want
 Fat cat#0147: So if I rate games its not the same as the submitter rating games? Will my ratings not be as impactful for getting our game more visibility?
 coolhotdogguy#4788: The very basic of my game is based on Doodle Jump. And I just added a small twist (or roll) to the movement. I think it counts as one mechanic.
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: only ten. 25 last year was... a bit much
 RedTeapot#1960: You'll be required to rate ~~25~~ 10 random games though, before you get to rate whatever game you want
 nizbel#9979: Make the greatest game of the galaxy
 syelan34#3258: Yeah, I mean that’s why I made a JavaScript game. You can only use the arrow keys, 2d movement only, a single mechanic of getting to the end.
 Nobody6502#8971: it's literally titled "the greatest game on the planet". How can you compete with that?
||/s if it wasn't obvious||
 CraaazySteeeve#7242: wait you can rate games even if you didn't submit a game? That sounds ripe for abuse
 Scolon#4218: Way too early to say that lol, there are 6k+ games
 BatYaggy#3015: Like hyperbolica?
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: anybody can rate submissions but you have to go through the ten random games first, same as people who didn't enter. itch back-end currently doesn't support treating contributors the same as the actual submitter sorry, they were meant to be working on it after last year
 DevByMarc#7784: Congratulations 🥳
 yumaikas#3530: I don't know if I've ever made a game with just one mechanic, lol. I always want to mix it up, and that always leads to overscoped, lol.
I will try that next jam, whenever that is, heh
 tykenn#8548: Plot twist: the "open world" is one small area that wraps around
 Nobody6502#8971: this isn't my game, it's the one that deserves to win tho
 Kira#7896: Yeah, your game is linked under your comments too if you're a contributor.
 theChief#0001: Keep links to 
 Fat cat#0147: I can still rate other submissions and get ratings for ours if i get added to the project as a contributor after submission time ended, right? Does it work the same as LD so you get more ratings the more you give?
 AppLaGee#5373: dude, you got that right! No funny business, got straight to work, and one all nighter
 Nijelous#2003: honestly couldn't imagine doing a longer jam, I'm pretty sure I'd either completely burn myself out due to lack of sleep or still have a broken mess due to overambition
 nizbel#9979: My gf kept on trying to guess the theme beforehand, glad she missed since she found a “trend” on the last themes and was sure this year would be either Hope or Devastation
 Scolon#4218: There is no winning game wdym
 CraaazySteeeve#7242: Throw caution to the wind! 3D open world mmo or bust
 coolhotdogguy#4788: This was practically my mission statement for this jam! 1 mechanic, 1 level (infinite), and only default unity sprites
 yumaikas#3530: I liked it a *lot* as a theme. It seems to have had a lot of good variation as well.
 RK#2024: Yeah! This experience was great. I've been wanting to dive into game music and this was a great way to dip my toes in (in 48 hours...)
 FryDev#0372: the theme definitely caught me off guard, I can give it that much, even if I didn’t really like how restrictive it was
 nizbel#9979: It started scary but it was a good theme indeed
 Omegnight#7081: My 2020 entry (theme: Out of Control), fits perfectly this year's theme too
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: trial by fire! the beginner-focused jams tend to be a week or even two weeks for good reasons, very well done there
 Mark Brown#6982: Glad it was inspiring!
 Mark Brown#6982: Congrats!
 CraaazySteeeve#7242: Also side note, Roll of the dice was a really cool theme imo
 Scolon#4218: I honestly can't believe how fast this went
 yumaikas#3530: But I think next jam I need to set hard limits, like 1 type of interaction, only polygons/polylines for art... Radically simplify, lol
 AppLaGee#5373: I have to say, this whole experience overall was almost surreal. First ever Jam, and first ever *actual* video game made. I almost can't believe my friends and I did it. It felt so so so rewarding when it was complete
 hoss#1671: Yeah it’s my first hackathon/game jam in about 6 years, so thought “why the hell not” and dice rolled z
 krisis in a jar#0904: Or should I say... *clears throat* Roll of the dice?
 Jerry#0485: For me this was my first GMTK Game Jam. I have only been like 3 months into Game Development. A great experience and a great learning
 Scolon#4218: Yeah throwing together a bunch of random people can backfire sometimes
It's good to build teams in advance and already get some synergy going
 FryDev#0372: probably would be a good idea to build up a team beforehand through multiple previous jams together
 yumaikas#3530: Last year I had 5 screens! 3 levels, one main menu, and a credits screen, heh.
This year I had 3, menu, level , and map.
I did have 6 enemies though, and a lot of art from my teammate
 hoss#1671: Yeah, had a team but everyone flaked on the first day. Super disappointed, but pushed through anyway. Next year I’m going to focus on finding a team earlier, maybe even way before the jam.
 Sapient#3138: Damn itch was back up fast
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: honestly they did about as well as could be expected. no site can be expected to sustain what has to be hundreds of times the usual load of people uploading big files without issue
 nicholas#8278: one of my friends got in a patch to fix a crash when you finish the game just before the deadline
 Tapu#9161: So a total of 2 hour 25 mins grace period?
 BatYaggy#3015: I want to work for Constipated Gorilla Studios
 CraaazySteeeve#7242: that's gonna happen when you're breaking records, hopefully they are even more ready for next year
 FryDev#0372: next jam I guess I’ll join a team or something, just so I can be a part of an actually finished product
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: itch crash was less than ten minutes before the deadline! i guess they're getting a learning experience out of the jam even if it's a pretty painful one
 StormyMay#4100: I know I have a diff perspective bc I'm not a dev but my goal wasn't a finished game, it was learning about the game dev process and team skills + portfolio work
 wren#0640: probably because of the new grace period hours
 Tapu#9161: More people making games
 yumaikas#3530: I usually try to submit a shell project early, so that I only have to upload a build. Trying to do it all last minute is oof
 CraaazySteeeve#7242: every game jam I am like, "alright so I'll do 10 levels, and a boss fight to end it!"
And by the end of every game jam I am more like "OKAY 3 LEVELS AND A THANK YOU SCREEN"
 cathy#3897: yeah it sure is a bummer but as long as you had fun and learned something right!
 Scolon#4218: I think the submission ratio will continue to go up if we stress to people to more to submit early/update later
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: yeah in particular for this jam we tried to be clear about having two hours at the end for submissions and there were still dozens of people who couldn't submit anything because itch crashed
 nicholas#8278: i wasnt even late or anything i just didnt even make a game
yet i am here, probably because im interested in game dev and want to learn something other than scratch LOL
 FryDev#0372: still kind of disappointed I couldn’t have got a finished game submitted
 wren#0640: i stopped working 2 hours before the deadline and had a nearly final build up 10 hours before i would not be able to deal with that amount of stress
 Scolon#4218: We have basically the same number of joins as last year, we just had more submissions.
Basically more people actually finished something
 StormyMay#4100: I think Ethan becker contributed a significant amount of artist first timers this go round, thats where I came from ^^
 hoss#1671: Don’t forget the huge amount of people who actually still missed the deadline or didn’t get a chance to finish (myself included!)
 nicholas#8278: its some extra time, so why not
everybody loves extra time in a game jam
 yumaikas#3530: I had 3 last minute fixes that made unbroke the game just under the wire, lol
 FryDev#0372: I wonder if 2023 will manage to be bigger, or if the amount of joins will just sort of plateau
 Fusoy#6101: There's some cool hidden gems in the games that still have zero ratings (Well, now they have one)
 qxt2019#6669: I had 5 hours left but had to submit due to my parents forcing me to get of my pc
 BadPiggy#5202: If they were forced to then they had too lol
 Nobody6502#8971: WHAT
 StormyMay#4100: Jokes on you we're all just way too ambitious
 Scolon#4218: Idk how people had the balls to submit their game as late as possible
 Mark Brown#6982: This one was very tight! It looked, right up until the very last hour, like it was going to be smaller than 2021
 yumaikas#3530: I enjoyed the Mizjam a couple years ago. You jam has kinda taken the place of Ludum Dare for me. It helps that it's only once a year, because of how intense a 48 hour jam is
 nicholas#8278: bro really got his game in the exact millisecond you still could
 RK#2024: That's a nail biter right there
 wren#0640: idk how people had the courage to work on their games while the itch servers were down
 FryDev#0372: still had 100 whole milliseconds left, could’ve made a game in that time
 AppLaGee#5373: Mark, if I may ask, how does it feel smashing the Jam's game submissions record each year?
 Vedal#1437: lmao
 Someone’s Shadow#9470: Nice
 CraaazySteeeve#7242: I definitely wanna see a retrospective video, when you get the chance to do a jam 😄
 nicholas#8278: LOL
 Scolon#4218: I wrote code as fast as possible during this jam and as a nice side effect it's a bit of spaghetti
I'm probably not working on a post-jam update anyways so its no big deal.
Hey, if it works it works I can make as much spaghetti as I want
 BadPiggy#5202: Pretty sure it has. A long time ago in fact
 qxt2019#6669: Yes, defeat the evil dice befor he defeats your pc
 FryDev#0372: I’m a gremlin
 Mark Brown#6982: Yes! I had real FOMO on this one, so looking forward to taking part in someone else's jam
 wren#0640: that was me! sorry!
 Someone’s Shadow#9470: I wonder like if the minigame loading screen has finally been unpatented
 Mark Brown#6982: I meant the ones chewing Itch.io's servers 😛
 RedTeapot#1960: What if Mark has patented the dice so he gets all the lawsuit money?
 yumaikas#3530: I'd be interested in seeing how you'd do in a different game jam, tho.
 BatYaggy#3015: Am I considered a server gremlin?
 nicholas#8278: ah yes some bad code that makes my game crash is a feature, okay
 StormyMay#4100: Jokes on you we didn't use the classic pip design and you can't copyright regular polyhedral shapes
 CraaazySteeeve#7242: 😆 it was a trap, 20k people have lawsuits on the way
 Mark Brown#6982: Nope! Have to focus on modding, communicating, and fending off the server gremlins!
 FryDev#0372: there definitely ended up being a lot more games which took “roll of the dice” more literally
 qxt2019#6669: Just make them features
 BadPiggy#5202: Well there goes my weekend
 wren#0640: patenting it rn
 AppLaGee#5373: Oh, oh my. That would be a massive yikes
 Someone’s Shadow#9470: ~~Well thats evil~~
 Mark Brown#6982: Imagine if the concept of a dice was copyrighted and it was illegal to use one without a license and I had to disqualify every game
 nicholas#8278: you forgot making a game in 48 hours with gamebreaking bugs that you cannot fix LOL
 CraaazySteeeve#7242: Mark did you participate in the game jam this year, now that you are flexing your game dev muscles? 😄
 Mark Brown#6982: Don't worry, it's pretty easy compared to making a whole game in 48 hours!
 FryDev#0372: it’s the guy who does the, uhm, magnets and boss keys, right
 Scolon#4218: I've seen some underrated gems just going through random that haven't been noticed yet
 qxt2019#6669: Poor mark
 nicholas#8278: hello mark
 BatYaggy#3015: HE'S HERE OMG
 CraaazySteeeve#7242: good luck Mark! Hopefully you get some quality stuff to sift through
 BadPiggy#5202: Become a patreon and you get to stay lol.
This server is primarily for GMTK after all
 Scolon#4218: Yeah it wont happen immediately,
Also Mark will play a bunch of games on stream later in the week, it's been a while though so I don't remember how exactly he does it
 FryDev#0372: #second-class-chat
 Mark Brown#6982: No team, just Mark!
 qxt2019#6669: True
 nicholas#8278: they could atleast just leave one chat open
 BatYaggy#3015: Must agree
 Viola_Buddy#6763: It'll be a shame to be yeeten from here. It's a nice community even if completely and madly frantic (by *far* the most chaotic few channels I've been in anywhere on Discord, even if only for a week). But I'll see y'all again in a year, presumably, for another frantic weekend.
 BadPiggy#5202: It took a few days if I remember correctly. I mean Mark and his team have to actually play the top 100 and decide lol
 CraaazySteeeve#7242: same haha
 Scolon#4218: I have no clue what my game has since I haven't checked it yet, but I played like 26 games before calling it a day.
I'm playing a LOT more tomorrow though
 StormyMay#4100: 3 last time I checked. Not really pressed about it its just curiosity really
 yumaikas#3530: Yeah, this. I'm here from 3 years ago (2020)
 FryDev#0372: how long does it typically take for the showcase video to be released after the rating period ends
 BadPiggy#5202: Pseudo-yeet
 nicholas#8278: I did not submit
 CraaazySteeeve#7242: I am down to swap games with anyone, DM me and I will play your game over the next 24 hours.
 qxt2019#6669: How many reviews do you guys have ?
 Scolon#4218: Hidden until Mark releases the showcase video
 FryDev#0372: kicked
 BatYaggy#3015: YEEEEEEEEEET
 BadPiggy#5202: There's a short period of time for everyone to reflect on the results
Then we all get YEET-ed
 Feesh#2467: Are the only ones who can rate games are the ones who submitted games?
 StormyMay#4100: Are we able to see how people are rating our games? New to itch and can't really find it
 Viola_Buddy#6763: Nice. I will prepare my emoji champagne to be popped in the hype channel for then.
 Scolon#4218: There's a short period of time ye
 BatYaggy#3015: ( grunts in i'm batman )
 nicholas#8278: doesnt say you cant do that
 Viola_Buddy#6763: Oh speaking of that video - the public part of this server is planned to go down "when that video is released" I remember - is that, like, the moment it's released, or will there be a day or at least a few hours of being like "🍾 hooray to everyone!"?
 Wabadaba#4373: am i able to add collaborators after the submission deadline or would that remove me from the jam
 BadPiggy#5202: ( oinks in oof )
 BatYaggy#3015: Imagine having a user name thats Ba___ggy
 Scolon#4218: You only see the relative placement, itch doesnt show the absolute stats iirc
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Scores are visible after the jam yes
 Omegnight#7081: Scores last year were held until Mark's video was out, so not at the end of the voting period
 BadPiggy#5202: Yup
 Viola_Buddy#6763: Will we see our scores at the end of the voting period? Will we see statistics of the overall score distributions?
 cathy#3897: ohh yeah fair enough
 tykenn#8548: I've seen several submissions without a working build. It's probably common to withdraw when you realize nobody can even launch your game.
 FryDev#0372: my game literally is not playable, there is no functional gameplay loop
 Scolon#4218: I'm going to keep my game up, i'm fairly happy with it
 Kira#7896: Yeah, some people have placeholder pages and remove them if they don't submit.
 CraaazySteeeve#7242: you gotta take pride in your messy beautiful game jam games haha
 BadPiggy#5202: 6.2k entries though oof
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: yeah all the games i reported yesterday are still there
 FryDev#0372: I’m going to private my game as soon as the jam ends
 Mark Brown#6982: Nope, just people taking their own game out of the jam!
 Omegnight#7081: I should not have went to "most rated" games lol
 Scolon#4218: The same way it always is, itch has an algorithm in place that weights everyones ratings based on numerous factors
 cathy#3897: is it because people are getting disqualified or something
 BadPiggy#5202: ***Purge***
 Maurum#2530: I like how as time goes on you can see the number of submissions going down lol
 birdstone#3073: Ayyyy, glad you enjoyed it!
 High noon hoopla is also a really good one
 BadPiggy#5202: How's the overall rating in the end going to be calculated ?
 FryDev#0372: I also like Bouree on the Board and High Noon Hoopla
 birdstone#3073: BRUUH ITS SO GOOD WDYM
 SeanSS#0892: Am still kinda bummed that my web build didnt work in time for me to notice but oh well
 Roiboi#2055: Daniel I played your game it's great
 FryDev#0372: honestly, I feel like that’s probably one of the worse ones, but they’re all still really good
 Nobody6502#8971: goodness gracious I got sent so many incredible games
 birdstone#3073: that's a good one but "bootlegger boogie" is still my most favourite
 GlerG#4782: So far I'm at 4 ratings, but that's probably normal without a web build and without having played and commented on anyone else's games yet
 Scolon#4218: Yeah I'm doing the bulk of my playing rating marketing tomorrow
 FryDev#0372: which one? my favorite is the Dogfight one
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: There's a lot of windows games still on 0 ratings, try to boost some of the unseen submissions and give them some good feedback
 birdstone#3073: same, i'm just chilling with some cuphead dlc music now lol
 FryDev#0372: the overall package, to say
 Kira#7896: This. I personally include polish in that category too.
 SeanSS#0892: I'll rate stuff tommorrow for now ima rest my body after exhausting myself over the jam
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: No presentation is how good the asethic of the game works so hwo the assets all go together including sound and art and juice all combined
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: If you want to allow people to DM you to do rate 4 rate then that's fine
 tykenn#8548: - finish playing game
- Alt+F4
 Fusoy#6101: The average is 5 rating per game, so yeah, it's more than fine
 Kira#7896: Hey
 yumaikas#3530: My team's game is only at 15 ATM, which seems fine, tbh
 happynessisgames#3531: maybe we should start a patreon, also hello kira
 FryDev#0372: I’ve give someone one dollar if they give me one dollar, plus tax of course
 SeanSS#0892: I'll give anyone here 100$ if they can give me 200$
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Nah, join *my* server and my patreon.
 FryDev#0372: our patreon
 Kira#7896: We do?
 BadPiggy#5202: We have a patreon ?
 happynessisgames#3531: wanna join my server and my patreon?
 JJfriends#3686: Any super sexy feller wanna rate my game
 xono#1000: just saw one with over 360
 BadPiggy#5202: In all fairness, it's usually better if you have less rates.
So don't fret
 Kira#7896: All these peeps getting hundreds of ratings day 1. I feel a bit inadequate lol 😅
 SeanSS#0892: This is quite litterally the mobile game "99% of people cant beat this!" Marketing schene
 mickychin#7933: is there anyway to play game with less lag in itch.io
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: 32!
 xono#1000: im at a whopping 13 ratings have quite a way to go lol
 FryDev#0372: oh, I see what you mean, I thought you meant as in the game itself is buggy and broken
 happynessisgames#3531: I'd probably get banned if I put a link here wouldn't I
 Fusoy#6101: There's a "Report submission" on the rating page of each games
 FryDev#0372: like report them on itch? I don’t get why you’d report a game just because it doesn’t work
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yes
 happynessisgames#3531: being social just because its fun is overrated, I'm here to see big numbers in the analytics section of the game lol
 Fusoy#6101: Should we report games that do not work ?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I mean....
 fp#6298: Added a new restart button
 xono#1000: yeah thats what i do, then i can mass uninstall them too (no hard feelings to the games)
 Tyler Hunter#0474: I'm gonna join team trade reviews.  PM if you want to trade reviews.
 happynessisgames#3531: no we're here to market our games and only that
 fp#6298: wow that's awesome
 happynessisgames#3531: Why have you not changed your name to dmmeyourgames?
 happynessisgames#3531: yooooooooooo
 nicholas#8278: it downloads and extracts the game for you
 Fusoy#6101: It is easier to download and play windows build with the itch.io launcher
 happynessisgames#3531: well I'm back once again lol. Dm me your games and I'll dm you back with a game and an invite to a good server for getting more reviews. Keep in mind though I won't be playing any games until tomorrow
 coolhotdogguy#4788: Yeah I was wondering this too! Since some of the plays from my game came come the new section not this jam section of itch
 Ian Mykl#4218: Wonder how many people didn't know about this jame and were wondering why filter by new was flooded with games about dice
 Ian Mykl#4218: Itch has a list of like, 6000 games you can rate
 xono#1000: i try to do windows games in mass lol
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: The git became really cursed in the Last 2 hour of the game jam
 nicholas#8278: lol
 Nobody6502#8971: trying a new tactic to find games to rate
 Ian Mykl#4218: Think I went from version 2 to version 7 in two hours lol
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: You probably fixed them but only created more in the process
 CraaazySteeeve#7242: haha yeah, every bug isn't fixed unless you fixed one within 5 minutes of uploading
 dragonier135#0895: hey, id love to have my game played, if you're interested I will absolutely make sure to play your game back! Dm me and ill get to it today or tomorrow!
 Ian Mykl#4218: The fact that I quickly identified and fixed almost all of my bugs makes me very afraid I didn't identify and  fix all of my bugs
 CraaazySteeeve#7242: I am sure most people participating would love that, but you can always ask permission in their comments
 nicholas#8278: i mean, i could make it in scratch
i can make a windows build using turbowarp packager
and also make a html5 build prety easily
so it would work, right?
 CraaazySteeeve#7242: as the programmer on my team I feel that.
the last 2 hours are just me banging my head against the monitor fixing bugs at lightspeed
 nicholas#8278: maybe i will next time if the theme is something that i actually can make
and just for the funny, why not make it in scratch? :troll:
 WebiYT#1230: Send me you game 😄
 fp#6298: is it OK if i ask people to play a new version? there are gamebreaking bugs, i don't care about participating in the game jam/getting disqualified, i just want people to try out my game and give me comments
 StormyMay#4100: literally 2 artists and one sound person playtesting and bug reporting like rabid dogs in the final two hours
 WebiYT#1230: Do someone know if it allowed to record the gameplay of some games? I'm studding game design and I'm thinking of making a video about it
 nicholas#8278: i didnt even submit a game LOL
 StormyMay#4100: we didnt have as much time left to debug as we wouldve hoped but I think it still turned out really cool
 nicholas#8278: atleast it was your first build or well, first upload
 StormyMay#4100: we got it fixed in time it was just really funny
 snuffysam#2767: which is why you make sure to do your first build as early as possible so you can catch any obviously game-breaking stuff like that 👍
 BatYaggy#3015: 
we all saw that kriss
 BatYaggy#3015: Better left in the "let of steam" channel
 Kritical#4329: Dm me your games i will start rating in a couple of hours
 piaresquared#6428: oh sorry i didn't notice the initial reply, thanks everyone
 DefinitelyNotAlex#8713: I like the part where the game just doesn't load, it's a big time save
 Cameron#7818: Itch page yes, game files no.
 nicholas#8278: as long as you arent modifying the downloads
 piaresquared#6428: can i edit my itch page after submission ends?
 THE T VIRUS#2754: I interpreted it as over all polish. Art, music, controls, and such.
 snuffysam#2767: art, music, lighting effects, sound design, storytelling (if any)
anything that makes the game more than its mechanics
 LOPSTERu#3902: Does the presentation rating just mean how the art is in a game?
 nicholas#8278: we are talking about rating all 6000 or so submissions
 snuffysam#2767: i guarantee it's impossible to beat every game in the jam any% glitchless
considering how many people have found game-breaking bugs in their game
 Dragondoodler222#1250: don't run glitched itch has been through enough today
 nicholas#8278: dammit we're doing glitchless?
 Dragondoodler222#1250: Rate by the quality of their username?
 Kritical#4329: Illegal in the any% glitchless
 nicholas#8278: yeah but you can rate a game without playing so there is a time save there
 snuffysam#2767: i just got home from a flight so i have rated... zero entries lol
gonna rate some tomorrow, starting with the folks that reviewed me
 paulhdh#6428: ive only rated 14...out of yikes....to be fair ive taken my sweet time with each, but man oh so many good games this year.
 Dragondoodler222#1250: if you do not sleep for 7 days and spend 10 seconds per game you can do it
 Kritical#4329: Thats way more than i have
 nicholas#8278: ~~speedrun rating all 6000 or so entries~~
 tykenn#8548: Making good progress with reviews. I've now reviewed ... *checks numbers* ... 0.3% of the entries
 nicholas#8278: lol yeah
 Kritical#4329: It does get a little annoying after the 20th time someone points out the same bug or shitty art but atleast it tells me to make a less buggy game ig
 WebiYT#1230: Im traying tons of games. But there are a lot. If you want me to try it send me the link please 🙂
 paulhdh#6428: this is very true. constructive criticism is very valuable
 Totally#7936: honestly, deserved (the other people deleting the comment is dumb, you did fair)
 snuffysam#2767: exactly! that's the biggest thing i participate in these jams for - i want to hear criticism!
i can't imagine someone only wanting positive comments on their game. wouldn't you want to know *why* you rated where you did? wouldn't you want to improve for future games?
 quantum#0043: ok
 BatYaggy#3015: I'll rate ur game, DM me the link.
 Kritical#4329: I actually want people to criticize the game how would I know whats fun to play and whats not
 quantum#0043: how do i get ratings?
 nicholas#8278: yeah they really should
I did try to go through the rating list to rate my friends game, but atleast I wasnt speeding through it like they were
I actually rated those 10 games honestly so
 snuffysam#2767: not possible, if you try to rate again you'll just change your rating
which i've done before, sometimes i go back and re-rate games that i judged too harshly or too leniently because i rated them early in the voting period
 Kritical#4329: Probably, itch should add a feature where you atleast have to download the game to rate it, or start the web version
 nicholas#8278: wonder if they did that just to rate their friends game 5 stars
 JJfriends#3686: Legit is over already dude
 Staintocton#1193: A couple people rated twice I guess.
 Kritical#4329: Some people speedran the rating list it seems
 Break#1234: damn my game has 4 plays but 6 ratings 🤨
 snuffysam#2767: on average, the top games of last year had 74 ratings each
and ranged from 18 ratings at the low end to 400 at the high end
ideally, if you want to rate highly, you want tens of ratings, not hundreds
though, i will also say
popularity overall doesn't necessarily mean notoriety as a game developer
i could easily imagine a non-gamedev youtuber who would develop a bad game for the jam as a joke, then tell all their fans to vote on their game
 Nobody6502#8971: you feel my pain. I wish you many ratings to come
 Kritical#4329: I only got 1 so .....
 Nobody6502#8971: *checks my game*
"rated by 2 people so far"
😐
 fibοηezrα#0727: ah true! really i should have said ‘consistency’
 Tyler Hunter#0474: But isn’t that totally not the case.  Popularity is not an indicator of quality.  Plenty of amazing musicians who still play at local dives and plenty of amazing super famous ones.  The opposite is true as well.
 Kritical#4329: More ratings doesn't mean a better score, one of my games got like 600 ratings and it ranked like trash because it wasnt good
 paulhdh#6428: i've played some amazing games today, that totally blew my mind as to what you could do with a concept like roll the dice. To be fair i thought it was a great theme and had an idea almost immediately, but like wow some of the stuff out there is pretty awesome.
 fibοηezrα#0727: there are some really good games. plenty of undiscovered gems
 snuffysam#2767: anyway the correct answer is that either itch's algorithm or basic statistics make that not as much of a factor
last year, only one of the top 20 most-rated games ended up in the top 20 best games list
 CraaazySteeeve#7242: this 100%
 haftai#0346: Send me your game I'll play and review
 fibοηezrα#0727: that’s how it goes with anything public. number of followers is probably correlated with quality of games they have put out. like if they got their fans to rep a shitty game people would unfollow
 Sapient#3138: Fair enough
 CraaazySteeeve#7242: I think most people who participated in the game jam won't randomly give a streamer/influencer a good rating just because they like them.
Too much blood sweat and tears to give out good ratings for nothing. Again, unless the game IS actually good, and then it's fine.
 snuffysam#2767: no you don't for the latter
you just have to rate 10 random games first. someone with a rabid followerbase could convince their followers to each give 1 star to 10 random games, and then give 5 stars to their game
 Tim Sheinman#8520: So many feckin dice, where to start?
 Maurum#2530: Anyone up for a good old fasion game trade and review? just DM me!
 Sapient#3138: But some people who dedicatedly follow streamers would rate their game high, and rate other games low, so they win....
 CraaazySteeeve#7242: lots of ratings doesn't necessarily mean they are going to get good scores though, unless the game IS actually good
Also they still have to have participated in the game jam to rate other games
 FredsMeds87#3239: Lol I feel that. I had only released one game and now two days after I decided to participate in this jam I have another completed released game. Yet my list of unfinished games will continue to grow lol
 Lavra source#3802: what
 Sapient#3138: Me who still hasn't done that
 Tyler Hunter#0474: Is it me or does it seem like games whose creators have a large social media presence will be the ones that get to the top.  I see games with 100s of reviews already.  That smacks of I got all my followers to mobilize on our behalf.
 CraaazySteeeve#7242: hahaha honestly same
 Antidissmist#5795: nice! jams are great for finishing projects
 yumaikas#3530: Ours was at least a portmanteau rather than just the two words
 Kritical#4329: I just realised if not for game jams i would never have pressed the build button on unity
 FredsMeds87#3239: What an experience, this was my first game jam.
 fibοηezrα#0727: Guess u skipped Dice Age 6: Return to Paradice
 Sapient#3138: Yea and no dice in the thumbnail of me
 tykenn#8548: While attacking the review list, I caught myself giving games without "dice" in the title priority for some reason.
 Kritical#4329: - you are actually dead and all of this is just a flashback of your entire life, which would be weird to have this discord conversation in the flashback
 spwn_srujan#1445: Ok
 ImNot_Kriss#3652: send it to me I will rate it
 spwn_srujan#1445: Should I delete the game? it is going to keep triggering me
 not without text#5469: thanks!
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: There's a lot of windows build games that still have 0 ratings, lets see if we can fix that by the end of the night
 ImNot_Kriss#3652: I might make a game about accidentally going into the future
 not without text#5469: - daylight saving time
- leap year
- you can see into the future
 JustAnotherHuman#4261: Basically everything except the actual game files yeah
 DevByMarc#7784: Thats why i nver sleep
 fibοηezrα#0727: i like that one!
 piaresquared#6428: hey i can edit my itch page even after submission ends right?
 ImNot_Kriss#3652: we'll that was random
 not without text#5469: hey, i *like* my "that's how i roll" pun, even though it's common enough that there's another game named that
 spwn_srujan#1445: Yeah T__T
 ImNot_Kriss#3652: I did feel like I was getting pulled by something when I was sleeping
 fibοηezrα#0727: well if you manage to go back, can you add a “no dice puns” rule to the jam? people are having too much fun
 snuffysam#2767: - you're actually 363 days early for the jam
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: You can talk about other people's games that you found if you think they are really good or interesting. That's a common conversation that happens in here, just keep it minimal, people can search it with the name and the maker
 ImNot_Kriss#3652: Or I mightve been gaming to hard I got sucked in to another dimension and came back and fast forwarded 3 days
 snuffysam#2767: yup! add an icon, screenshots, description, change CSS theming, etc.
don't change the build though. just don't touch that section, you might accidentally delete your build
 fibοηezrα#0727: - on purpose time travel but pressed the wrong button (it happens)
 DevByMarc#7784: nooooo 😭
 not without text#5469: THEORIES:
- accidental time travel by moving fast
- accidental time travel by other causes
- on purpose time travel but memory loss
- distracted
- you didn't miss it at all
 RedTeapot#1960: Yep
 THE T VIRUS#2754: Are we allowed to still make changes to our itch page?
 snuffysam#2767: oopsie
 fibοηezrα#0727: yeah sorry, your time machine is 60 hours fast
 spwn_srujan#1445: I just realised i didn't submit the game for the jam
 ImNot_Kriss#3652: **BRUH** I barely sleep whatever I'm gonna go play rain world or roblox
 piethedestroyer#3192: glitch in the matrix
 Kritical#4329: sleep?
 ImNot_Kriss#3652: So I did miss it somehow idk how the heck I missed 2 days
 Floofinator#7144: I want to see a number of how many games where casino is the setting
 snuffysam#2767: me after waking up from being haunted by the sprits of GMTK jams past, present, and future
 Squishy Turtle#3988: The jam did started 58 hours ago
 not without text#5469: ereyesterday (two days ago)
 Cearáj#9556: I think it was someone else's game
 ImNot_Kriss#3652: **WHEN DID THE JAM STARTED?**
 Kritical#4329: i knew "Dice Dungeon" would be common but i saw like 3 with the same name before the jam ended
 Merus#7019: DM instead
 Merus#7019: don't send links to your games in this channel, thanks
 Merus#7019: nope
 not without text#5469: you should probably clarify which one, there are multiple
 dragonier135#0895: yeah!
 a zebra (moo moo)#6277: well anyway its called paradice and It was a super hard but unique puzzle game
 not without text#5469: *one eternity later*
 Vedal#1437: dm?
 Speg#9708: oh yeah that I know, but that's even harder to get in these streams ha ha
But yeah, multiple opportunities!
 nicholas#8278: what
 Lukey#6052: no - actually, maybe? idk
 a zebra (moo moo)#6277: guys I was just doing my rating queue and I found a really great game that hasn't been rated much yet
edit: can we post links in here?
 dragonier135#0895: would anyone like to play each others games? im looking for some good feedback on mine and im totally down to do it back.
 RGBCube#8833: imagine if `love.graphics.rectangle()` was considered an asset
i'd've used so many premade assets lol
 JJfriends#3686: any% is how fast u beat and 100% is all the dices collected
 Cearáj#9556: hoo lee damnm, that one is entirely in a different dimension
 Kritical#4329: i feel like we will have to wait a couple of centuries for this one
 Lukey#6052: Next year I might join a team, but to be honest I like working solo. It's very satisfying when the jam comes to a close and you look at your game (especially if you didn't use any old assets or free assets, cause you get to look at it and think 'I made ALL of that')
 Schmuff#7990: go check out Die in the Dungeon by StarFahx, I just played it and really enjoyed it, but it only has 2 ratings
 ImNot_Kriss#3652: nvm ill just wait 3 months
 JJfriends#3686: I need more people to rate my game I require internet number for validation
 ImNot_Kriss#3652: I swear I havent forgot about it for 3 days
 Kritical#4329: just become immortal
 not without text#5469: 6 hours to START voting
6 days to END voting
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: the voting started immediately after the jam finished and closes in a week
 Lukey#6052: Damn, gotta pass my game down through generations
 ImNot_Kriss#3652: No it said 6 hours till starting
 fibοηezrα#0727: yeah, a music production community used to do 25 minute battles and 48 hour battles. the songs from the 25 minute one were always more interesting and daring
 Cearáj#9556: 1760 years jam (yes, there's a jam on itch with that duration)
 not without text#5469: 6 days for voting to END
 Someone’s Shadow#9470: Rating period is a  week after the submissions, there isnt a reason why you cant rate
 RedTeapot#1960: After the results are announced, yeah, some aggregated info will be available
 ImNot_Kriss#3652: I thought it just started taht was weird cause I saw starting in 6 hours yesterday and when I checked rn its voting in 6 days??
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Not until the ratings are finished
 not without text#5469: what?
 BadPiggy#5202: Aye, I'll be playing your game as well after work
 Kritical#4329: I had to rush my game at the end, scoped a tad too big
 ImNot_Kriss#3652: guys why is voting already?
 Squishy Turtle#3988: You’re very welcome stranger
 GAMERNINJASK#1503: can i somehow see ratings for my game?
 BadPiggy#5202: Holy frik
I just woke up and and a lot of people already played stompey dicey lol
Thank you to everyone who played it :)
 Scolon#4218: Also people are more lenient on themselves when you give them more time to do something
If you give them a week to do X they'll assess how long it takes to do X and then do a very small portion each day or do everything as late as possible
But when you give them borderline bare minimum time to get something well-made then they won't waste time
 Kritical#4329: that would still be less time
 Someone’s Shadow#9470: Ohhhh I can see it work kek
Yeah ive tried to get every feature down, but had resort to only the core and if i had enough time maybe get the others, but i shouldve focused on whats there and polish
thanks : D
 Cearáj#9556: decade jam
 Lukey#6052: Personally I like the 48 hours limit, makes you not waste time and forces you to focus. When I work on personal projects, my biggest problem is that there's no urgency to get it done. Game jams help to force you to just... make something. Just my opinion tho.
+48 hours fits very nicely into one weekend
 not without text#5469: then join a 72 hour jam, then join this game jam in 2024 or something. this is my first game jam but i needed to make incomplete games so i can truly understand game design concepts
 ThatIsANoNoWord#5311: 72 hours would be a lot better and allows for some more fleshed-out games, but 48 hours would also push people to only make a game with what it needs
 Scolon#4218: I think it's also a part scoping/planning problem though
If you had 72 hours a lot of people would plan to make a game they could make in 70-ish hours and the issue of people running out of time/missing the deadline would still exist xD
 Squishy Turtle#3988: Just pretend you have 43 hours and that the rest is for testing
 fibοηezrα#0727: like, write down bullet points for all of the features that you want in your entry, then choose 2. it hurts at first, but then you realise that you can make those features deeper than originally
 codykodi#1189: 48 hours is crazy tight, also kinda fun though
 Henry_Hamster#4240: ok then nevermind and thank you
 NalaFala38290#9305: the problem is that now my game is too easy and is boring
 Lukey#6052: 'only one message per game please'
 Someone’s Shadow#9470: Hmm, like just removing them or not implementing them? Ive removed some features to be out of scope, but feels like there more to it (also i like the link thanks : D)
 snuffysam#2767: bugs that make it possible to cheese your game >>>> bugs that make it impossible to play/beat your game
everyone loves wacky speedruns, people don't like randomly freezing in midair & crashing
ideally you'd want to iron out anything that a normal player could reasonably run into, but if those are the only bugs that's not so bad
 Henry_Hamster#4240: just as a comfirmation, can you resend a game jam review my game message with the same game if its been 6 hours?
 Lukey#6052: I'm glad my game ended up being pretty self-explanatory. I did include a small amount of info inside one of my screenshots though, just in case.
 eMChe#3779: Have the same problem, absolutely forgot about tutorial
 Chowdog 宗翰#0135: I had a bug that made our game easier, it's not game breaking tho, lol
 tested#4997: same
 MK#2034: I wish we had time to put the tutorial screen into our game, but I'm hoping enough people figure it out or read our description.
 NalaFala38290#9305: I made an oversight that decreases the difficulty
 Scolon#4218: I just realized a mistake I made in my code
It's not a bug, but it's an oversight that increases the difficulty of my game a bit lmao
Oh well
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: You can't ask for reviews in here but sharing a interesting game you find that isn't yours is completely fine to mention providing its not excessive (we might remove embeds) so if it's specifically the art you are referring to consider posting it as an image
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yeah we will encourage sharing games people have found later, it's a common thing in here to share game titles etc that you find.
 Someone’s Shadow#9470: Might be indirect tho hmmmmmm
Eh mod decides ¯\__/¯
 TwoWholeWorms#8078: I believe that's if you're asking for reviews.
 Lukey#6052: I don't believe you're supposed to post game links outside of 
 Someone’s Shadow#9470: Legs.
 digonalmeida#7858: Would not agree about the "most people". Whenever I go to local jams ( i do it more than I should), people usually plan on working on the game later.  I don't like it, and have seen many disappointed and not coming back because they end up investing weeks in a 48hs jam.
I would agree that if it has good acceptance,  people should consider polishing it.
 Lukey#6052: yup, winter here :D
 RGBCube#8833: my question about the game of luck is:
why have i not seen a 6 the whole game lol
 Someone’s Shadow#9470: Oh right, if summer is at north, winter is at south right?
 Lukey#6052: *New zealanders laughing*
 cosmylk#2812: *Australians laughing*
 Merus#7019: I'm not sure, there's a heatwave going on in the UK which makes sitting in one place without cooling a little unattractive
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: not yet afaik
 BadPiggy#5202: Wait, did Mark say when he'd be streaming ?
 Someone’s Shadow#9470: Oh dear kek
 ajedro#4638: it's like making a sketch of a Game, artist don't finish all their sketches
 Someone’s Shadow#9470: Huh, that seems to apply to me hard
The feeling at every game need to be full fledeged, but without the feeling of it just being done, yeah thats stressful…
 Merus#7019: Mark doesn't just play the top 100 games; he'll do streams where he plays random games as well
 cathy#3897: ive been playing through a ton of games and i think its been proved that team size doesnt necessarily mean success or lack thereof
 nicholas#8278: ah
 krisis in a jar#0904: I'll be rating my last game of today, DM me your game! (preferably games with low ratings amount)
 Lukey#6052: That's why most people don't plan to release every jam game, only if it's a really good game that would be great if fleshed out as a full game
 Yampy#1994: 100% I get all dice, any% just get to the end as fast as possible
 RGBCube#8833: can you link me the one in dms just so i know i got the right one lol
 digonalmeida#7858: Planning to update the game later usually makes jams more stressful for me. It's easier for me to enroll in the jam when I know it will be over on a given time no matter what.  Game jams start to overwhelm you if you plan to release every Jam game .
 nicholas#8278: what is the difference between any% and 100% on game of luck
 fibοηezrα#0727: last night i played an amazing board game called galaxy trucker. you build a spaceship and pilot it along a trade route. dice rolls are really cool in the game, they determine which side asteroids will approach from on a grid. one of my friends rolled an asteroid that hit his ship perfectly in the centre, which broke it in two parts. he chose to keep the right half of the ship, but there was an alien on-board that immediately hijacked it and flew off with his cargo XD
 Yampy#1994: 29.86 any% and 39.22 100%; vids are in the game's comment section
 fiendfire#3466: hollo knight is so fun to speedrun
 nicholas#8278: what is your time on it lol
 Yampy#1994: anyone make or know of any good games from the jam to speedrun? I optimized *The Game of Luck* this evening and I think I've pushed it close to its limit so I'm looking for something else to try out. Particularly platformers or other sorts of action games
 Someone’s Shadow#9470: Oh yeah on the first time, its a wonderful feeling to get something out and playable
~~too bad if the quality of output is still the same though afterwards~~
 krisis in a jar#0904: Yea, i'm really proud of mine aswell, even though it's pretty hard lol
 fiendfire#3466: what about cockroaches
 nekotheasparagus#0809: I play mine too. I like it ^-^
 Chowdog 宗翰#0135: I've also been playing my game, and the balance is terrible lol, and there are some minor bugs 😦
 RGBCube#8833: > being happy on what has been made is kind of tough
unless its your first ever released game 
 fiendfire#3466: if fruit flys eat fruit...
 krisis in a jar#0904: I've been playing my own game even after the jam has ended for some reason
 Tob#1798: for real
 Someone’s Shadow#9470: rip
 Speg#9708: I kinda wish top 100 wasn't the way to have mark play your game because it's always so stressful waiting for the leaderboard 💀
but at the same time there is 6000 games so it's not like there's any other fair way to do it
 Viola_Buddy#6763: It can be used metaphorically, but even as a native English-speaker the literal meaning is much more prominent in my mind than just a metaphorical "luck" sort of thing. Especially in the context of games - you wouldn't say drawing an ace from deck of cards is "just a roll of the dice" in the way that you would some less-related-to-gaming things ("getting into XYZ prestigious thing is just a roll of the dice" for example).
 Someone’s Shadow#9470: Welp ive guranteed myself a low rating with dev assets, and horrible presentation
¯\__/¯ honestly being happy on what has been made is kind of tough tbh
 Schmuff#7990: I keep coming across really solid games with only like 1 or 2 ratings, it's really difficult for games to be found in 6000+ entries
 SkyanSam#7970: the only reason I have motivation to work on the game atm is because there is a bug that needs fixing
 Tyler Hunter#0474: Can anyone with an itch.io account rate the game or only people who entered the competition?
 FryDev#0372: my motivation to work on the jam game after I upload it just plummets
 snuffysam#2767: I always say I will and then I don’t
 Uthel#6594: I feel like it depends on how happy you are with your final placement 😛
 Someone’s Shadow#9470: intresting…
 krisis in a jar#0904: Nope, atleast i don't think i will
 snuffysam#2767: In theory you could TAS the game with perfect inputs and it would work the same every time.
 Merus#7019: > the GMTK video did explain it but ig not everyone watched that
us mods have lots of experience with people not reading or seeing the information provided
 Uthel#6594: well also, a roll of the dice is actually a roll of the dice
 Someone’s Shadow#9470: Do you guys update your jam submissions after the jam has ended?(after voting period as well), On the one hand i feel like it stays as is and is really ok, but on the other hand it feels like it has potential wasted if not updated
 FryDev#0372: so I guess another reason for the amount of literal dice games is because the phrase “roll of the dice” is not a global expression
 krisis in a jar#0904: Ok, i'll be taking a break from rating games now
 Merus#7019: I might mention this to Mark for next year
 fibοηezrα#0727: yeah that actually happened. i had to explain to someone the idea of making a game that isn’t literally rolling dice. the GMTK video did explain it but ig not everyone watched that
 Merus#7019: delightful, look forward to seeing it
 snuffysam#2767: Um. That’s literally our game lol
Zero actual RNG required to win, and in fact, every time you do something with RNG, you lose
You have to rig the casino games to win. Slip your own cards into the deck, swap in loaded dice, etc
 FryDev#0372: oh, I see
 tested#4997: thank you
 Merus#7019: hmm, it occurs to me that the idiom might not fully translate for ESL speakers - "roll of the dice" is an English idiom about taking a chance, but if English isn't your first language, you might not know this
 petrak＠#9412: hi  i love your blahaj game because blahaj
 fibοηezrα#0727: “throw of the dice” means take a risk, which is a better metaphor for what FryDev was mentioning
 Someone’s Shadow#9470: ~~throws at your eyes, and still shows up as snake eyes~~
 nut dealer#1157: if you told someone to throw the dice what would they do
 Uthel#6594: an idea I had way too late:
a play on words concept: try to dice vegetables while inside a rolling vehicle and the gravity keeps changing relative to your roll position
-no dice, just rolling and dicing
 yumaikas#3530: Like a puzzle game based on all of the outcomes being fixed
 quantum#0043: roll of the dice was a hard theme i literally couldnt randomize the roll
 FryDev#0372: “roll of the dice” is the specific expression
 Merus#7019: a casino-themed game that's fully deterministic would be _very_ funny
 fibοηezrα#0727: isn’t that another way of saying roll the dice? oh, “throw of the dice”
 Merus#7019: yeah, like I could imagine push your luck games, or story games _about_ doing something risky that doesn't require complex RNG
 nut dealer#1157: why "throw the dice"?
 quantum#0043:  nice joke
 Scolon#4218: Everyone just really love the dice theming is all
 fibοηezrα#0727: Well why didn’t they make the prompt “a small chance”, or “throw the dice”? it’s specifically *roll* and *dice*
 honiemun#0001: I'll point out in the description that the link isn't functional and that the build won't be up until voting is over soon as I get home 😅
 FryDev#0372: “roll of the dice” could mean just mean taking a chance on something, it doesn’t have to be related to literal dice
 RGBCube#8833: fun fact: one of my folders has **all 40 of the pre-rendered images** i had made for my original dice design
edit: i found it
 Merus#7019: the spirit of the rule is that we don't want people to try and get reviews based on a version of the game they had a whole week to work on
 Scolon#4218: Yeah, i'd also put that in the game description to be extra extra safe
 fibοηezrα#0727: I think you’d have to include rolling dice somehow
 honiemun#0001: Oh, the description doesn't have a link, the game build does. Like, _on the menu_
It should be fine if I just make the link go "oops no newer builds are allowed until voting is over !!"
 Merus#7019: _well_
 snuffysam#2767: That’s a creative one lol
 Merus#7019: oh, you have a button in the _in-game_ menu
 Merus#7019: hopefully you can change the description, quickly
 Scolon#4218: Hurry so you don't get disqualified
 honiemun#0001: Oh frick, just found out you can't link to new builds on the description. That's all fine and good, I don't have a newer build up ||yet|| — problem is I planned ahead and have a button in the in game menu that takes you to an itch.io link that _eventually_ will have a newer game build.
_Oops_
 RGBCube#8833: me: `love.math.random(1,6)`
 FryDev#0372: I think it’s because there are two main ways to interpret the theme: RNG mechanics or literal dice, and RNG mechanics are probably more difficult to make fun and interesting
 Merus#7019: no jam game links in general, please! 
 clay#7015: Thank you! :D
 Wenlong#7472: There are precisely six games named Dungeon Roller. Perfectly balanced as all things should be.
 CryoTyro#4910: would a simple physics sim not work?
 petrak＠#9412: aha my game uses all the polygonal dice! bwahaha
 Merus#7019: yeah, I think most people went for some kind of literal interpretation of the theme, rather than metaphorical
 fibοηezrα#0727: Sekiro dice thrice
 wyrm_slayr#7477: Doll
 nicholas#8278: most of the games have the word "dice" or "die" in the title
 piethedestroyer#3192: if you combine "roll" with "dice", you get "rice" (:
 RGBCube#8833: any more and the number wont fit on a single die
 NalaFala38290#9305: nobody took my pun title
 clay#7015: Is there a good way to simulate rolling a weighted die? My team is planning to keep working on our game and we’ll need to figure out how to do that
 Cearáj#9556: ouch
 petrak＠#9412: Ah heck there are now SIX games called roll playing game
 FryDev#0372: there are a ton of games called “Roll or Die”
 Scolon#4218: There are so many games called Slice and Dice
 fibοηezrα#0727: that hurts my brain
 RGBCube#8833: not to mention the number of games called "slice and dice"
 honiemun#0001: Those are rookie numbers
 Cearáj#9556: 1065 messages saying "dice" in this server today (UTC-3)
 Merus#7019: it's an idiom about aviators feeling like they're gambling when flying, hence they're rolling the dice
 petrak＠#9412: my game is literally called "roll playing game" ghjdfjghdlkfjg it was a placeholder and no one thought of a better name 😅
there's even another game with the SAME NAME 😩
 Merus#7019: "a dicey situation" is _already_ about dice
 Merus#7019: oh lord I have a special loathing for puns on things that already mean what the pun's supposed to be
 honiemun#0001: dicey would have worked just as well .....
 Scolon#4218: There has to be a record for like
"Most amount of times the word 'dice' has been said in one day"
that was just broken today or something
 syelan34#3258: there’s one I tried called “a diecey situation”
 Merus#7019: hi, it appears you misspelled 'best'
 birdstone#3073: SOMEONE give whoever made that some kind of award
 nicholas#8278: the game of luck
 Cearáj#9556: I mean yeah you're right, as well as suggesting things that could make it better
 Scolon#4218: Actually yeah, we're probably going to eclipse last year's rating counts
30k this early is quite fast
 honiemun#0001: Every other title is some dice related pun and I can't help but groan more and more the harder I scroll
 Tyler Hunter#0474: So I can update my itch.io page like text and screenshots as long as I don't upload a new build right?
 RGBCube#8833: bro what game lol
 Wenlong#7472: Among all the punny titles I've seen this jam "Dienasty Warriors" was so far the worst
 syelan34#3258: Damn that’s an insane amount
 coolhotdogguy#4788: Has anyone seen any endless scrollers?
hloly crap
 tykenn#8548: so negative feedback is pointing out the problems instead its strengths, but not necessarily mean. at least that's how I always understood it
 Scolon#4218: There's probably going to be A LOT of people playing tomorrow so I'd try to be active then I guess
 Merus#7019: but if you can I think it's always better to try and mention at least one thing that you liked
 nicholas#8278: 34.72 lmao
 Scolon#4218: Reminder that most people are on break/sleep rn
Last jam had 142k ratings total and we're only at 30k right now
 Cearáj#9556: yeah, exactly my thoughts. People fear criticism way too much
 Beeg scarf#3571: i think a lot of people who make top down shooters dont realize that dodging itself can be just as fun as shooting
 RGBCube#8833: dang so my game doesnt count, you have to *attack* them
 tykenn#8548: polite negative feedback, "Heads up I had this issue with it and could have been better in this area, but congrats for finishing a game"
rude negative "feedback": "your game sucks"
 FryDev#0372: imo, it’s better to only list out flaws with a game in a concise and helpful way than just to give some cookie-cutter comment of “nice game!”
 Merus#7019: I think you can give entirely negative feedback in a way that's not rude, but a bit of compassion for the developer, who hopefully did their best over a very small amount of time, goes a long way even if you didn't enjoy their game and can't think of anything positive to say about it
 Beeg scarf#3571: if you have to dodge em yeah
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: it will get some, submission time ended less than 8 hours ago, don't panic
 RGBCube#8833: does a ton of enemies attacking you count? lol
 Merus#7019: we've had issues in past years where people have used embed perms to fill the channel with... undesirable things
 Cearáj#9556: exactly, it's better to point out the flaws than to just say something bland
 wren#0640: even if a game is like down right terrible i think only listing bad things is a little rude
 Beeg scarf#3571: buddy thats positive feedback
by definition its negative if its rude and doesnt help
 CryoTyro#4910: I'm worried my submission won't get any ratings because it doesn't include a webgl build :\/
 FryDev#0372: negative feedback doesn’t have to be rude, you can give ways for the game to improve and give things that the game did well to balance it out
 Beeg scarf#3571: 👍
 wren#0640: something being fully functional ie "not unfun" "not bad looking" gives it at least instantly a 3-4 in my book
 piethedestroyer#3192: it's in  ! it's not buried yet, i think
 nicholas#8278: the page? yes. the game itself? no
 Tapu#9161: Why don't people have embed perms in  ? Watching the videos in Discord is much better than opening multiple tabs in browser
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: No
 CryoTyro#4910: no, you cannot
 Yolo#1987: Can I update the game during voting time?
 Gallow#3741: I replaced all categories with "dice"
and rated accordingly
what is with this slowmode
 wren#0640: i think im pretty lenient with how i review games
 Scolon#4218: For me sometimes it's just really hard for me to formulate thoughts when nothing really strikes out as me
I have a fairly standard rating system though:
For **Fun**, you're only getting a 1 star if your game literally isn't playable. 2-3 stars if I get the idea but I don't think it wasn't executed very well. 4-5 stars if your game made me smile/laugh. You can usually somewhat tell what my fun rating is by the comments I leave lol
For **Presentation**, you're only getting a 1 star if  you make something *seriously bad.* 2-3 stars for inconsistencies/lots of things missing, 4-5 stars for high levels of polish
For **Originality**, it just depends on how predictable your game's ideas was/how many times I've seen it before :v. You're only getting 1 star here if you copy pasted some other concept
 Beeg scarf#3571: oh right yeah i was thinking solely about arcade type games
show me 
 FryDev#0372: also people might not read the text on the page even if it’s not in the game
 piethedestroyer#3192: that would be mine LOL
 wren#0640: yeah but text in the levels can look better and also lets you time when the player gets information
 petrak＠#9412: Well! you can get 5 stars total right? it might have been a 1 star game, but that leaves 4 stars for a 4-star learning experience
 Beeg scarf#3571: more like text on the page, that way you can edit it all the times you want and it also gets translated
 wren#0640: text on the levels is the way to go if you cant teach with pure level design imo
 Cearáj#9556: it's honestly better to just be honest and not rude, the point is that there should be true feedback
 FryDev#0372: I hope next year’s theme is less restrictive and doesn’t mostly revolve around a singular object
 honiemun#0001: Tutorialising is really tough when you barely have time to implement the mechanics! If you can't do it in-game on time, best you can do is try and explain it on the actual page.
 mnikn#9647: haha
 CaptainCarrot#1312: I'm just. Really unhappy with how my game turned out. I did a very poor job explaining the rules and I think it's going to severely affect my rating. #1 feedback I get is "looks interesting, I don't understand."
 Lawn#1538: Not yet, but I was pretty close to adding it to my game. Ran outta time though.
 Galse#8611: Since someone mentioned other themes, IIRC 2020's theme was Out Of Control so people might criticise Mark for having out of control and out of sight since they are both "out"s
 petrak＠#9412: Mm yeah ... I guess I rely on other people speaking their mind? idk. i don't really think about it in terms of other people, i just don't like reading nasty comments 😅
 yumaikas#3530: The clock in the video had me wondering
 Beeg scarf#3571: has anyone found any bullet hell entries?
 honiemun#0001: That's every game jam's theme, isn't it
 nicholas#8278: 35.62, got it down 1 more second
 Merus#7019: Please do not post any suggestions you had in order to remind me, btw
 Merus#7019: I do not remember at all what they were
 Lawn#1538: It should be ‘Out of Time’, as tribute to those who missed out this year.
 Galse#8611: Same, but if everyone thinks like us and the game isn't good for whatever reason, then the person doesn't get feedback?
 Merus#7019: I saw some good suggestions while people were guessing the theme, I hope Mark was taking notes for next year
 Cearáj#9556: giga chad
 Lyfe#8258: You're out of touch, im out of time
 petrak＠#9412: If i can't think of anything nice to say I just leave my stars and don't say anything, i always wanna leave them with something nice to read
 honiemun#0001: Honestly kind of a banger theme
 Galse#8611: I hope I'm not one of those people that leaves mean reviews. I usually try to point out something the devs did nicely then talk about stuff I did not like.
 Scolon#4218: "Out of Sight"
That's the next GMTK theme, calling it now
 nekotheasparagus#0809: One of the broken games made me sad. It looked so cute and I wish I could contact the dev to ask for a link for a  fixed version after voting ends ;-;
 petrak＠#9412: Wait, you can see the ratings you got?
 honiemun#0001: out of sight out of mind!
 nicholas#8278: and got it down to a 36.76
 honiemun#0001: damn, you got a speedrunning community going?
 Merus#7019: well if they stay out of sight then no-one's going to see the copyrighted content, are they
 JJfriends#3686: guys update people managed to finished my game in 29.86 seconds bruh
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: Lol
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: always
 LRFLEW#1584: 👍 I made the report now. I'll keep an eye out for any more, since there are bound to be a bunch each year
 Galse#8611: Damn ngl from what I've seen so far there are quite a few games where damage dealt is random. Most of them don't have a good implementation tho, as they felt overall unfair.
 honiemun#0001: can't wait for the game jam team to disqualify my game because there's an among us character hidden out of sight
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: so use whatever reason is most accurate, I think "broken/unplayable" is one of the reasons
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: No just that button is specifically in context of the game jam
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: Yea i hate when people try to do that too. Especially when they try to rub it in
 LRFLEW#1584: I figured as much. My main question was whether the report reason mattered. (i.e. if I needed to use "Invalid jam submission" for it to go to the jam specifically instead of itch or the dev)
 AquaduckStudio#0780: just rude reviews. people worked hard on that this stuff. be nice even if you didn't enjoy it, you know? like dont go out of your way to put people down. golden rule
 nekotheasparagus#0809: Oh, jsut checked again, but at the top it does say
"Please complete this form if you need to contact the itch.io moderation team about the content of this page. Your report may be shared with the creator of the page if necessary.
This report will be made available to hosts of GMTK Game Jam 2022."
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: if a game doesn't work if its unplayable then report it on the jam page
 LRFLEW#1584: The description for "Broken" on the report page specifically says "We will share your error with the creator to help them fix the issue." That's why I assumed it was going to the dev and **not** the jam.
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: Not me... what kind of reviews are you getting?
 Sappir#7051: How do you guys do you're star reviews?
I put...
1 star for things that have issues,
2 stars for okay things,
3 stars when I actively enjoyed that aspect,
4 stars for when it impresses me, and
5 stars for the gods among devs
 tinderet#7708: I didn’t know that! That’s good to know. Thank you!
 keep.it.simpl#5606: DM the link. I'll play it 😁
 Scolon#4218: With that in mind it's also good to know that you can't get "review bombed"
Itch.io also has protection algorithms for that, if itch detects that your game is being unfairly rated the unfair ratings will be either weighted way less or completely disregarded
 nekotheasparagus#0809: Broken doesn't go to the developer, there's a different way to contact devs
 LRFLEW#1584: What should I do if I run into a submission that doesn't work? I should report the submission, right? Does it matter the report reason? I can't tell if "Broken" will just go to the developer, and if I need to use "Invalid jam submission".
 Merus#7019: we've had to tell people who have uploaded their game to Heroku and made an iframe on itch that this would let them update the game after submissions have closed, and might lead to disqualification
 iofractorg#6427: my game has 3 reviews and 1 play (but no comments)... I can only guess the reviews are probably 1 star reviews
 Sappir#7051: wow...
 nekotheasparagus#0809: I believe you can delete comments, I would do that for nasty ones some people just don't have anything better to do then be jerks online
 lilburlap#8480: Yeah I know that I was trying to use forkphorus but didn't finish the game
 Merus#7019: the larger problem is that submissions have closed
 Squishy Turtle#3988: Had someone leave a 2 star itch rating  and say “good game, mine was better”
 nicholas#8278: you still could make a game in scratch for this game jam
there's a tool that allows you to make scratch games into HTML files, so it wouldn't be against jam rules
 lilburlap#8480: I don't recommend trying
 AquaduckStudio#0780: has anyone else just gotten really nasty reviews? like.. omg
 Zoro5168#0115: I need to see bloom guy's(redline) game
 Merus#7019: If you see games using copyrighted content, report them through itch.io
 AppLaGee#5373: same here, this was my very first game jam
 nicholas#8278: wait i just realized you could make your game in scratch for this jam :troll:
 Zoro5168#0115: Mark is true gamer
 Scolon#4218: I went all out on this jam and I'm still recovering
 nicholas#8278: i'm still trying to improve my pb
 AppLaGee#5373: how is everyone this evening (for me)? I just woke up after crashing out from an all nigher
 krisis in a jar#0904: Yessir
 JJfriends#3686: 19 ratings we can push foward
 haftai#0346: Send me games
 aflyingpotato#7521: Sent! and man there are so many games I want to play that are windows only 😞.
If anyone wants me to play their game feel free to DM me! . Mine is in my profile too.
 Zoro5168#0115: Midnight +2
 Squishy Turtle#3988: What even is morning? :philosoraptor:
 Trigon#2432: Time is fake. Clocks are propaganda from big clockwork.
 tinderet#7708: Woke up from a huge post-jam nap after art directing my first submission, super proud of my team 🙂 ready to play, rate and review some games tonight!
 krisis in a jar#0904: I'm trying to rate all games, I've  been rating all day lol
 redka#6365: that's not morning?
 ZEST#7932: Morning..
 krisis in a jar#0904: Send me your games (that are playable on the web or are available for Linux) so i can rate them!
 redka#6365: it's actually 2:49 AM in the UK right now
 cathy#3897: well it ended 7 hours ago
 FryDev#0372: I don’t know if I want to finish my game, the motivation to finish plummets after the jam ends
 Squishy Turtle#3988: I would encourage you to finish anyway!
 ZEST#7932: It's morning buddy in England, god knows where you're living 😂
 Zoro5168#0115: Oof
 redka#6365: or evening if you're british
 cathy#3897: oh dear
 JJfriends#3686: it ended this morning
 ZEST#7932: I thought this jam ends tomorrow
 nicholas#8278: >Your account must be at least 7 days old to make a game request.
you have got to be kidding me
 nicholas#8278: ok
 nekotheasparagus#0809: So many cool looking games that don't work. I wanna play Snailware dangit!!!!!
 JJfriends#3686: do it i dare u LMAO
 SeanSS#0892: GOOD JOB EVERYBODY WHO SUBMITTED THIS YEAR, EVEN IF UR GAME IS UNPLOSHIED OR BUGGY OR UNFINISHED OR STUCK ON THE MENU SCREEN WITH NO WAY TO GET TO THE ACTUAL GAME, YOU DID IT!
 nicholas#8278: i just had a very unnecessary idea, put the game of luck on speedrun.com
 cathy#3897: yeah it makes a lot of sense since downloading is just another step that people aren't willing to take
 Zoro5168#0115: Gmornin
 JJfriends#3686: The Game Of Luck, also pls rate
 revort#0913: yeah, and if you look at that list you'll see that very few of them if any can be played in browser
 nicholas#8278: yeah there is
 cathy#3897: I think there's also a section of itch that allows you to play the games with the least ratings
 Relis#1309: doing the lords work o7
 revort#0913: I'll go find it 🙂
 nicholas#8278: i did worse this run, 37.90
 SeanSS#0892: o7 to you sir
 JJfriends#3686: or u could play my game
 BRICAT#6837: Ah okay. that is not too bad! 😄 Thanks!
 revort#0913: ya I'm gonna start playing and rating the least rated games, they're pretty much all desktop-only so to the itch app I go
 WebiYT#1230: I didnt have the chance to participate but im seeing a lot of cool ideas in a lot of your games
 JJfriends#3686: 1 week i think
 BRICAT#6837: one question. I would like to keep working on the game I submitted even after the jam. when is good to update new build without being against the rule for the game jam?
 TwoWholeWorms#8078: I think that one's actually breaking the jam rules due to using copyrighted content  :/
 NitramiuZ#4145: Haha wow I can see why it is a speedrunnable game, my turnbased game wouldn't fit as well...
 nicholas#8278: i got my pb down to a 36.81
 JJfriends#3686: you have like a 1 second window when the first level loads you can dash during that time period
 RedcoatsRevolt (Adam)#1185: Random submissions. Some really really cool games out there
 Merus#7019: Please don't ask for reviews in this channel
 WebiYT#1230: Oh haha. My bad
 nicholas#8278: i'm trying to get my pb down but i keep making mistakes lol
 TwoWholeWorms#8078: _Very_ copyrighted.
 FryDev#0372: if you mean for the jam, the jam is over
 nicholas#8278: is the companion cube copyrighted
 WebiYT#1230: Anyone is needing help with game design? I can help 🙂
 银翼yyyy#3002: Ok
 Schmuff#7990: also isn't it explicitly against the rules to use copyrighted content in your game
 akaBl4ck#7384: 
 JJfriends#3686: The Game Of Luck a buncha people are tryna to speedrun it rn..
 nicholas#8278: a 20 second run is going to be very hard
 yumaikas#3530: What game are y'all playing?
 JJfriends#3686: if people can get in the 20 range im legit abt to cry like how the game took my 2 days to make and people sepnd 20 seconds to finish
 nicholas#8278: i just took my pb down to 39.83
 JJfriends#3686: hes got a sub 30
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: the public channels close a few days after Mark's video get released
 akaBl4ck#7384: i feel really bad for the peoplethat didn't finish their games
 nicholas#8278: yeah i know
 BrainCanibala#8362: Hello
 JJfriends#3686: cutscene is included in the run no skipping
 Beeg scarf#3571: when the winners are announced prob
 akaBl4ck#7384: when will the chat vanish
 nicholas#8278: i would be at like a 36.55 if it weren't for the 10 second cutscene at the start LOL
 JJfriends#3686: noice noice u got this beat the record
 Beeg scarf#3571: yeah, pip flip paradise, neat game
 nicholas#8278: just took my pb down to a 46.55
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: search the games by least rated, lets see if we can get every playable game rated and commented at least once
 yumaikas#3530: But, it's the second jam or third jam game I've made where I didn't hate the structure at the end, though I definitely still overscoped it, lol.
 JuliusCube#8501: na
 wren#0640: did team bugulon make a game this year?
 nicholas#8278: i'm trying to work towards taking down my pb then i might go for wr
 JJfriends#3686: 17 ratings we're getting up there les goo
 yumaikas#3530: My team ended up doing a Lane Defense game, though it's*barely* holding together in the parts towards the end, heh.
 birdstone#3073: my first thought was a boss rush type game with a dude like king dice watching over the whole thing but i shot it down because of the scope
 JuliusCube#8501: i found like 3
but yeah lets stop like walrusware said
 JJfriends#3686: someone got a sub 35
 wren#0640: ive seen a lot of sokoban-y puzzle games where you play as a dice
 froeg#0757: i dunno if that made any sense at all, sorry if it didnt :/
 nekotheasparagus#0809: Anywho - I've seen lot's of interesting takes on the theme. Litteral ones and more abstract but all are pretty neat
 Ber#3410: but its scientific stuff
 Ber#3410: thats what happens when the jam ends
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I think as this is a family friendly server I'm gonna say we need to end the penis talk
 froeg#0757: id go with a small project to learn the basics, maybe a clone of a small retro game like snake? if you can add your own twist to it then even better, id just recommend against making a huge original game as your first unity project because it can be a lot to learn and it can be easy to get bogged down refactoring old code when you learn a new feature or something. :)
 nicholas#8278: and i just speedran it and got a 53.27
 Pudigor#4425: Hey, if you want me to rate your game feel free to DM me with the link, I would also love for you to check out mine but its okay if you don't lol
 nekotheasparagus#0809: I left for 10 minutes and now the topic is penises
 krisis in a jar#0904: Lmao. Send me your game, i want to see it
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: There's 100% a penis in our level. But, so far, everyone else pointed out a different penis I hadn't noticed. Lol.
 coolhotdogguy#4788: If anyone wants to swap games to play and rate you can DM me!
 JJfriends#3686: uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. oops
 nicholas#8278: if you go left while entering a certain level, you will go off the map and you have to close and open the game again
 Wokarol#0940: Now that you mention it... might have also made a slightly phalic level but hopefully it's not as close so it's only my broken mind that sees it
 JJfriends#3686: which bug?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yes you are as long as you take stuff to DMs ect
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Damn, Time To Penis was immediate! Lmao.
 nicholas#8278: i found a bug in your game
 Wokarol#0940: Debug gizmos?
 Ber#3410: when i wanna learn unity what should i do for a starter project
 krisis in a jar#0904: Show collisions, normals, vertices, etc
 Ber#3410: yes i think
 coolhotdogguy#4788: Are we allowed to offer rating for a rating?
 krisis in a jar#0904: Mine has a debugging features, does that count? lol
 Wokarol#0940: Okay, fair.
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: alright, ill play it
also my game's called Janitor's Roll, if you wanna play it, idk. I already linked it in  but its way up there now
 krisis in a jar#0904: Nope, because mine doens't have levels
 Schmuff#7990: oh jeez what did I do people are dming me (also my game is called Gambler's Curse, I linked it in , and it's the one without the flames in the thumbnail)
 Wokarol#0940: Also:
 Lukifah#7240: Cool Game
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: whats your game called?
 JJfriends#3686: rate mine pwease
 wren#0640: nooo
 Teslobo#8274: you are hereby banished to the penis level
 Schmuff#7990: 2 ratings still 😭 . I've been rating and commenting on lots of games in the hopes that some will also rate mine
 wren#0640: so far no ones noticed but there is one level thats *slightly* phallic looking in my game that i didnt notice til i published it
 Pudigor#4425: rates are hard to come by huh?
 nicholas#8278: inb4 sub 10
 JJfriends#3686: same guy got a sub 35 (also 15 ratings pog?)
 yugioh#7402: lmao that is a name alright
 JJfriends#3686: mine is basically all blocks no one is gonna see any penises
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: The amount of time it takes for someone to either make or point out something penis-shaped in your game.
I think our TTP  was about an hour. Lol.
 JuliusCube#8501: i see
 JJfriends#3686: its the one with the shitty cover
 yugioh#7402: ttp?
 Pygocentrus#8974: I was playtesting every game yesterday there has just been too many today
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Y'all ever heard of TTP?
 aflyingpotato#7521: sorry! just dmed them
 Ber#3410: if anybody wants to play my game its my name
we're allowed to do that
 JJfriends#3686: The Game Of Luck
 Merus#7019: Don't post your game here! 
 JJfriends#3686: on my game
 JuliusCube#8501: on what?
whats the game called
 nicholas#8278: yeah. it's actually 1 minute
 Kira#7896: Yeah, just edit it into your message. The 2 minute slowmode is... yeah.
 Relis#1309: i really appreciate it guys but i don't like to beg for ratings, don't wanna be _that_ guy, not that there's anything wrong with it
 [Jun]#2687: Missed the first 12 hours,
I'm so tired haha. I spent 35 hours of the jam trying to design a dice golf game.. I did allot of design work and things but couldn't land on a mechanic.. felt defeated but had 3 hours to go so tried to blitz another prototype idea out and managed to make that with 5 levels !!
Hope everyone can had a great jam.
My game is called "shepherd" btw
 nicholas#8278: what's your game? i'll give it a rating and some feedback along with it
 Kira#7896: Want a rating/comment from me?
Same for you  ?
 aflyingpotato#7521: just checked mine, two ratings and one comment and that was hours ago...
 Lascif#0184: If anybody would like their games reviewing and feedback feel free to send me a DM. I'll give it a go first thing in the morning and I'll let you know when I've done so.  👍 (Also I'd appreciate if you'd try my game 😉 )
 Jaken#3572: sounds fair
 Wokarol#0940: Discape, a small puzzle game
 Relis#1309: one rating, no comments. but i'm not stressing it, it sure is nice to get ratings and comments\feedback, but at the end of the day i'm happy i've done it
 NitramiuZ#4145: or to keep to the theme, Mark rolls a D6200 100 times
 Jackcats0#4141: nice! What's your game?
 Lawn#1538: Don’t try this at home kids.
 nicholas#8278: yeah it's just a gray screen when opened by the itch.io app
 Jaken#3572: I though it was miles
 noidstruct#4545: i managed to get it in 30 minutes before the deadline,  but the thing is i had forgotten to put my pck file next to my exe (this was my first time exporting with godot) and so i was scrambling in the last few minutes to reupload WITH the pck included in the zip
 Wokarol#0940: 7 ratings
7 comments
overall positive response
CTR 1%, kinda low
22 browser plays
Not doing numbers but also not dying
 Kira#7896: Most highly ranked across the 3 categories. Don't know the exact equation. But you need to have above median amount of ratings or yours gets downscaled. So people with one 5 star rating don't win.
 NitramiuZ#4145: average with a penalty for games with low amount of ratings to balance
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: They're measured in kilometers.
 nicholas#8278: yep, there is. it makes installing games and playing them a lot more easier. however only downside is you can't play html5 games in your browser, therefore having to install every html5 game. for html5 only games it just downloads the html file. itch.io app even has a sandbox for things you don't trust lol
 JJfriends#3686: oop
 Pudigor#4425: how are the Top 100 games measured? avarage rating or most ratings?
 kablouser#4232: Next, I want to do nothing.
 Lascif#0184: Literally did the webGL in the last like 20 minutes 😂 was doing car dev work the whole of the day so never got a chance to work on the game today
 Kira#7896: Us too. It was risky haha.
 King Sol#2650: There's an app?
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Oh, damn. That's like the opposite of us! Lol.
 noidstruct#4545: 8 ratings
 nicholas#8278: your game doesn't load when installed by the itch.io app
 Wokarol#0940: 30 minutes to the jam deadline or submit window (2 hours after)?
I always tell myself I won't make the first WebGL build in the last hours... and always fail :v
But we had time to spare so that's good
 Roiboi#2055: We did our first build 2 hours before the deadline
 Jackcats0#4141: how's your guys games goin
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Yeah, we cut it hella close. Lol.
 JJfriends#3686: why are people tryna to speedrun my game lmao i didn't think it was speedrunable
 birdstone#3073: I actually did the first build for ours within the first two hours and dealt with a very big performance issue
 Lukey#6052: true chad
 Wokarol#0940: Ah, I see you like to live on the edge
 Scolon#4218: elite gamer
 nicholas#8278: i can't even get sub minute
 Ber#3410: \][OPIOJHIJGUHHWHAT
 JJfriends#3686: DUDE HOW SOMEONE GOT A 39 SECOND RUN WTF
 Ber#3410: you are allowed to have your server nickname as your game name
i asked earlier and they said its fine as long as its not the link
 Schmuff#7990: wow, I've gotten 2 lol
 JJfriends#3686: The Game Of Luck
 sbubby#4885: 12 ratings today, let's go
* i mean gave 12 not received, oops
 wyrm_slayr#7477: What's your game?
 Ber#3410: hello dog
 haftai#0346: Hello
 JJfriends#3686: LMAO some guy got a sub-47 on my game, LIKE HOW I CAN'T EVEN DO IT IN A MIN
 Delphins#9165: oh nice sounds great, i'm gonna check it then !
 krisis in a jar#0904: oooo, send it to me. I love Celeste
 Mukhavertolet#2243: from what i've seen most games focus more on presentation rather than gameplay and tech stuff
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Oh, no! Lol. My banner and stuff is the stuff for my game studio. That was made a while ago. My game is more D&D and Rambo inspired. Lol.
 Delphins#9165: n p don't worry xD, i was just asking if the pictures that you got in your discord banner is the same game that you submitted in this game jam
 JJfriends#3686: my game is (game of luck) if people wanna speedrun it, its kinda like celeste so if ur a pro celeste speedrunner u should do it
 Scolon#4218: Same I have way too much I still need to do in other places too
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I'm gonna go to bed early tonight. I'm exhausted.
 Delphins#9165: does your game is the same as your discord banner? it look nice^^
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Lets see if we can get no playable games with 0 ratings and comments by the end of the day
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I wanna exchange games and rate other games... but, I'm so tired.
 LethalChicken#3001: I bet they can't speedrun my game sub 1 minute
 JJfriends#3686: LMAO there are people speedrunning my game sub 1 minute
 Ber#3410: you need to comment on games and put your game in  to get players
 xono#1000: send yours to me, ill play yours you play mine, anyone else who wants it played just dm me
 LethalChicken#3001: yeah I just gotta change it so that controller and m&k don't use the same control scheme
 JustHellygar#8689: what s minimum?
 Ber#3410: im happy 😃 11 ratings
people actually like my game
 syelan34#3258: I hate when adding a “small fix” ends up being super long and tedious and annoying
 Beeg scarf#3571: Whats up pal, and yeah its called Roll around and find out you can find it on 
 LethalChicken#3001: even better with my bug is removing the multiplication by delta time screws up controller sensitivity
 Beeg scarf#3571: after jam ends
 syelan34#3258: At least it doesn’t really break anything, in fact because it’s a puzzle game you can’t actually beat it in unintended ways by doing that. It just makes it kinda fun to try and mess around
 Penguinmanereikel#3708: How do we see our game’s ratings? Or do we see them after the jam ends?
 Antidissmist#5795: i wish i could play and rate all the games lol
 Heromerom#0787: lol
 LethalChicken#3001: f
 Sappir#7051: Should I write a explanation on what things are broken on descript?
 Beeg scarf#3571: Most rated game so far
 syelan34#3258: I did this with my game this year, because I didn’t test the entire path to the next position (you teleport) you can just skip over gaps
 Squishy Turtle#3988: Oh sure it’s called Roll n skate
 ImNotAsher#6733: EUGHHHH
 LethalChicken#3001: I always do this, I choke right at the end and can't fix it. Last year I had a really fun game but I screwed up the balancing and made it ridiculously hard at the last minute, and this year I didn't test on low frame rates.
 syelan34#3258: I’d like to try your game, what’s it called? I only have 2 games played so far
 Beeg scarf#3571: i rate, play the game again after a while but this time i take my time, then comment
 nicholas#8278: i do too
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: I always give a comment with the rating explaining my thoughts
 syelan34#3258: I would recommend putting a note in the description for now, since you can’t upload fixes yet
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: please do consider giving good and useful feedback not just ratings because it helps the devs learn more
 Gumy#7061: 🫠
 SparkerXof#3127: Well, now we have 6000+ games to try.
 LethalChicken#3001: yeah that's the workaround for now. I've considered just withdrawing and releasing a fixed version, but I can just put a note on the game page
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: da vibe
 syelan34#3258: I guess people could just turn their sensitivity down but yeah that’s weird, I never would have realized something like that
 LethalChicken#3001: yeah I was multiplying the mouse delta by delta time, but I didn't realize that mouse delta is already based on frame rate. so basically on low frame rates with a larger delta time, the sensitivity goes crazy.
 syelan34#3258: Damn I’ve never seen something like that happen, glitches tied to too low of a frame rate?
 wren#0640: i dont know why but the go to compliment for my game is "lovely", ive seen it in like 5 comments/ratings, definitely a very nice thing to hear though!
 LethalChicken#3001: Damn, I really wish I could update the game to fix one major bug for anybody playing at less than 144fps
 syelan34#3258: Yeah 1 minute is insane, I would personally use  just because the cooldown is 5s instead of 60
 Scolon#4218: The slowmode is still there because of earlier when everyone was losing their mind
 Crusher#6146: Cool, thanks!
 nicholas#8278: you're able to edit anything about the itch.io page except the downloadable files (also this slowmode is ridiculous)
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i try to play the games to completion at least once and review from that viewpoint
 syelan34#3258: I’ve done that and it’s meant I’ve reviewed less games but at least each one has suggestions about what could be improved and what worked well. It also helps to see what’s fun in games to think about in future ones
 BatYaggy#3015: I'll rate it
 SeanSS#0892: Are the WebGL builds still dead for you guys?
 Scolon#4218: I'll check my stuff tomorrow morning, I got other things to do
Like eat
 wren#0640: i have 26, absolutely no clue how i dont think ive been pushing it that hard
 Crusher#6146: Quick question, I know we are allowed to edit/upload new screen shots for the game but can we also edit the description?
 nicholas#8278: i probably should too
 Hemera#2002: 2 on ours..
 Beeg scarf#3571: i got 11 reviews but honestly i should spend more time with the games i review lol
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i have 5 too, that seems to be like an average for now
 Jamesor#6153: That’s a really good mindset
 MetalGearSamus#0001: Only 1 rating still on mine :|
 syelan34#3258: I have 5 so far, I’m happy with that right now
 Scolon#4218: Yeah I leave comments personal to each game
 wren#0640: i think im gonna do well but doubt ill get top 100
 nicholas#8278: whenever i rate a game i always leave a comment
 noidstruct#4545: i got 6 reviews and i mean, could be worse lol
 JJfriends#3686: If everyone votes positive then the dream of making it in the video might be possible 🙏
 wren#0640: i need to review more games tbh
 Jamesor#6153: I mean you can have fun playing without reviewing tbf
 JJfriends#3686: Play my game
 syelan34#3258: I mean I didn’t find any that were bad or even just boring games, so I ended up being mostly positive and tried to find what kind of annoyed me while playing and tried to come up with a solution
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i'm at 16 reviews for today
 Scolon#4218: Some of my comments are memes
If you see me posting memes in your comments that's a good sign 
 yugioh#7402: I haven't reviewed any because i don't trust my reviewing
 coolhotdogguy#4788: Nah it just opens in a 690x960 window
 Mukhavertolet#2243: I played 11 all rated and left with feedback. Going to continue tomorrow
 nicholas#8278: it would be even funnier if it forced you to go into windows settings and change it back, but yeah, sadly web games cant set the desktop resolution, an app installed on the operating system needs to do it and web browsers probably don't have a function to change the resolution of the computer
Glad to hear everything is going well!
 syelan34#3258: That would be hilarious but unfortunately I don’t think web games can set the resolution
 Hemera#2002: 3 but only bc it's 2:30am here and I have work tomorrow XD
 coolhotdogguy#4788: Lol the reason mine is so small because it kept looking huge in the browser when I was testing
 Relis#1309: two for now. not many, but i hope to catch up tomorrow, too tired tonight after the jam 😦
 nicholas#8278: wait did you make the game set the desktop resolution to 690x960
 Mukhavertolet#2243: Hey everyone! How many games have you rated already?
 yugioh#7402: I'm still happy from getting myself a new laptop it's all i dreamt it's an emulation beast i love it so much also I've hit the gym today so I have some dopamine rushing to my brain so I'm rly great thx for asking
 soosh#0798: zamn, thanks anyway
 syelan34#3258: Lol I just made mine 1440 x 900 because I tested it on my laptop and didn’t want the sizing to change
 nicholas#8278: time to go find some games to play
 Selviam#7268: its time to rate and vote woohoo!
 syelan34#3258: No, none at all
 yugioh#7402: Shadow my man hru
 coolhotdogguy#4788: yes yes 690 x 960
 Lyfe#8258: I hope you made it 690 and not ending in 69 because every rendering system whines at you if you have an odd number resolution
 soosh#0798: this might be the most asinine question humanity has ever known, but are you allowed to submit additional builds of the game (like a web build) during the voting period, so long as you don't change the content?
 coolhotdogguy#4788: lol the resolution of my game might also be a 69 joke
 yugioh#7402: Ok
 Lyfe#8258: I've done it a couple times before you just gotta set an alarm (and enforce it) for when you want to go to bed in addition to your normal alarm
 PlatosMan#2789: Dm me your game and I'll check it out in a bit
 yugioh#7402: That doesn't work in my experience tbh
 Relis#1309: i know what you mean. I think i got really lucky with that this time, i'm not a good designer by all means, but the difficulty curve seemed ok watching my friends playing. But then again, only three people tried and they are my friends, so it might be biased
 Lyfe#8258: Bruh just fix it over like a week, sleeping earlier and earlier until you reach your goal
 yugioh#7402: Good night sweet dreams
 CadenJO [DM to trade ratings]#2365: ok i'm going to sleep - my game is in my bio - i expect to wake up with 6,900,000,000 ratings - love you all ❤️
 The Handsome  Cat#6115: Got it sorry gn
 nekotheasparagus#0809: 
 yugioh#7402: I mean stay awake all night and all morning until you hit the hour you want your sleep schedule to start
 PlatosMan#2789: Honestly, I always had an issue with balancing games because I get too good at playing them while making them and I lose sight of how a brand new player would experience this. This time I actually had a couple of hours for someone to play the game and help me balance it and it helped make the game a lot more fair and fun
 jonahhw#9743: And if you can't fall asleep when you want to, lie in the dark and (potentially) listen to music or an audiobook rather than looking at your phone or going on your computer or something. People who are trying and failing to fall asleep still get some benefits of being asleep
 Relis#1309: yeah! the best part of this jam was watching them play and struggle and curse me lol
 yugioh#7402: Yeah pretty much at least that's what i do
 The Handsome  Cat#6115: You mean wake up earlier than you would normally ?
 jonahhw#9743: That, and force yourself to get up when you want to get up too (Can't fall asleep if you didn't wake up long enough before)
 Jamesor#6153: Same, they always do that lmao. At least I had a blast watching them play and struggle
 Lyfe#8258: ?? so just have a whole night without sleeping so you can reset it??
 FryDev#0372: oh
 redka#6365: i might pick it up at some point though, i formed a good team this year and we got more into 3D (game's Twominator)
 yugioh#7402: Stay awake until the hour you want your sleep schedule to start at
 CadenJO [DM to trade ratings]#2365: i cant my sleep schedules fucked
 JuliusCube#8501: what was the name of your game that got onto honorable mentions?
 Relis#1309: yeah same, i only had 3 friends to test it. they had fun but they're my friends and i'm pretty sure they sugar coated a bit
 Scolon#4218: Go to sleep
 The Handsome  Cat#6115: I fucked my sleep schedule, How to unfuck it ?
 Jamesor#6153: I’m more worried about people not playing our game and not getting feedback about it than I’m about ratings tbh
 FryDev#0372: what was the name of the game
 redka#6365: lack of time
 Mattstov(Matt) ⃤#8596: i accidentally pasted the wrong thing in the review channel lmao and we arent allowed to edit messages
 JJfriends#3686: Unreal to op I doubt it
 nicholas#8278: the problem is sometimes you can't make a web build, and then you get less votes for not being able to make one
 coolhotdogguy#4788: My first couple I didn't do web builds. Since then I try to always make mine playable in web
 The Handsome  Cat#6115: When ur game has a bug but you already submited: oh no... anyway
 BatYaggy#3015: Does unreal support web builds? I think my game was too big for a web build.
 FryDev#0372: I always do a web build
 Relis#1309: thanks! i hope the same for you ^^
 nekotheasparagus#0809: If you remove web builds you get less votes. Why not remove downloads instead? If your computer has a web browser you can play the game, you can’t run  an exe on a Mac without an emulator (not being serious, just don’t see why webgls negatively affect anything)
 Jamesor#6153: That’s okai, next time you surely will know what to do. As a fellow downloadable-build guy I hope you game gets played and people have fun with it
 nicholas#8278: yeah the itch app makes it a lot easier to play download only games
it's like steam's app, but for itch.io
 The Handsome  Cat#6115: Fr
 circleseverywhere#1423: if you only do it for the ratings sure
 AlexBR#3963: Welp, I made my game using a library that doesn't currently support web builds (raylib rust), so...
 BatYaggy#3015: I got the itch app which makes it easy to play download only games
 yugioh#7402: Happy birthday to your cousin
 Relis#1309: lesson learned for the next jam i guess
 nicholas#8278: kinda sad how almost no one will play it if you do make it download only
~~can we just remove web builds entirely??~~
it's also kinda sad for people who can't make a web build for some reason
 Lukey#6052: Game Jam Rule of Thumb: If possible, make a web build. Even if you have to use a precious hour fixing weird web bugs.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: yeah i dont know but i dont think mark brown saying "well i think this thing was good for this event i made" automatically makes it something you need to pursue to completion and release on steam to astounding success
 DS#3415: Thanks m8!
 The Handsome  Cat#6115: It's likely, I said it was a free ticket not a easy one
 Relis#1309: i had all the time to make one. I'm just dumb and didn't. i'm so mad at myself lol
 King Sol#2650: That's similar to mine. I intend to add more progression to make it a rogue lite experience, if people like the base concept enough.
 coolhotdogguy#4788: Thank you! I think it would work well for mobile!
 Jamesor#6153: We tried doing one an it didn’t work properly, maybe because itch.io was buggy. We got scared and just made it downloadable lol. Kinda regretting it too
 nicholas#8278: yeah...
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: its unlikely, you would still have to market it and work at it
 akaBl4ck#7384: ok this jam was fun asf
 The Handsome  Cat#6115: Congrats to ur cousin, fun fact I made my game with my cousin
 SparkerXof#3127: No, just interesting how hard people can make their games. I noticed after work that my game could be too difficult. Like bullet hell.
 King Sol#2650: Your game was slick. It'll be really nice once fleshed out
 DS#3415: Dang somehow i did uploaded the game in time, right before my cousins birthday!  congrats to everyone here who's finish it in time too 😄
 coolhotdogguy#4788: This is the first game jam I’ve done (or game I made ever for that matter) that I really think I’ll be polishing and fixing up and publishing
 King Sol#2650: That sounds more like a dropped opportunity though, what stopped you doing more?
 Relis#1309: i regret so much not making a web build...
 The Handsome  Cat#6115: Developer's mistake
 FryDev#0372: what game did you make
 redka#6365: doubt, we got a gmtk featured game last year on the honorable mentions and never went any further with it for some reason
 King Sol#2650: Is this the key to getting ratings?
 SparkerXof#3127: Difficult? Can I try it?
 The Handsome  Cat#6115: Being showcased in a video on the gmtk channel is a free ticket for your game to become a steam realese
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: peopel did have the resources to get good rng right, there's a video by mark on it that i watched twice or thrice to get the concept of input and output randomness right
 Scolon#4218: So like, you get a ton of exposure so that could be really good.
Also sometimes you can expand your game and make full releases from these jams
 nekotheasparagus#0809: I’m hoping to see some games that have examples of great RNG
 [Error_27]#3011: The dice theme was kind of interesting just because of how RNG can be so hated at times
 Scolon#4218: Winner gets nothing (besides being showcased in the video)
 King Sol#2650: Sure, I'll PM you
 nicholas#8278: nothing
 Delphine Noel#1196: What's keeping you unhappy right now
 The Handsome  Cat#6115: I don't really care about the ranking system, I am glad that I learned something, and that many people will enjoy my work. Btw what the winner gets ?
 wyrm_slayr#7477: Difficult you say? Could you perchance send me a link to this game?
 Peewi#8572: I only previously participated in 2020 and I have no memory of how it was rated
 Lukey#6052: Last year I *almost* made it into top 1000, but this year I think I might do better.
 JJfriends#3686: If I get top 90% I'll be happy
 Delphine Noel#1196: I think having dice in the theme really gave people a lot of ideas, just make whatever and throw a dice in it. everywhere you see, there's a game with dice in its name
 King Sol#2650: My game is kinda difficult. I hope people don't give up in furstration lol
 Scolon#4218: When the jam is over you get a placement in each category showing you how well you did compared to everyone else yes
 Static doodles#2251: Ohhhh that explains why itch wasn't working for awhile
 MK#2034: Our game was 30-something last year. And it was our first game jam ever.
 redka#6365: I don't expect anything great, I think our concept is unique and fun but my god is it weird to work with
 King Sol#2650: Oh do we get a ranking?
 The Handsome  Cat#6115: The last level of my game is unplayable bc one button is not working, that button is not working bc an audio source is not assigned
 nicholas#8278: also its kinda sad how if your game doesn't have a web build less people will play it
 JJfriends#3686: It happens every year nothing new lmaoo
 Scolon#4218: My last game was top 500 I think, so I'm aiming to beat that
 nekotheasparagus#0809: Bugs are not the same as not working, like one game I saw was unplayable because the page was private
 coolhotdogguy#4788: the dream...
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i think if i'm realistic my game might be top 50%. i think
 nicholas#8278: yeah
 ChrisDBrown#0127: Yeah for real, I’m just happy to have gotten it together in time for submission. Finishing any game in 48 hours is an achievement
 Delphine Noel#1196: I'm just happy that my bugs don't affect the majority of my game
 JJfriends#3686: Top 100% is what I'm shooting for yeah
 Lukey#6052: Yeah I think I've got better chances then I normally would've since so many people's games just don't work at all
 The Handsome  Cat#6115: This triggers me, bc in my game I have just 2 bugs, and I can Not change the build
 PlatosMan#2789: Honestly, I'm just so glad I didn't quit. I almost did when I wasted 6 hours before deciding on a project just to DO something. A few people have already played it and liked it and I'm feeling so proud right now. Game jams are the best
 nekotheasparagus#0809: I found a game that sounded cool but the page is restricted ;-;
 Scolon#4218: Yeah, some people should've submitted earlier, tester earlier, etc.
 JuliusCube#8501: if I get top 50% ill be happy
if i get top 25% ill be very happy
 JJfriends#3686: If I make in the video I'ma put this shit on my portfolio
 Arkeon#9826: oh ok I see, thx!
 Delphine Noel#1196: yeah a lot of games are not even working
 cathy#3897: quite an oddly specific example there
 Scolon#4218: You can get in the top 1,000 with a good amount of effort and skill
Top 100 will be a bit of a challenge though yeah
Reminder that bottom games are usually not even playable
 WebiYT#1230: I didnt had the time to participate. Hope everyone is doing an amazing work. Ill be glad to play some of the games you make 🙂
 The Handsome  Cat#6115: For those days when you home alone a bored these games will help, better then 18+ content.
 Lukey#6052: My game is not the greatest but I'm hoping to get top 1000 (top 100 would be pretty awesome)
 Delphine Noel#1196: but that's from pure odds not from how good your game is
 JuliusCube#8501: yes, but if your game looks decent, and its not a buggy mess, its closer to 5%
 JJfriends#3686: Gg for me not going in the video let's go
 nicholas#8278: ~~i thought he was playing through all 6,221 submissions~~
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: being in the top 25% would be a great success to me
 nekotheasparagus#0809: Being in the top 100 is being in the top 1.6%- very low odds
 Scolon#4218: From what I've seen though, if he finds that games have similar ideas to one another. They'll be showcased within the same segment of video and he'll show different alterations of that core idea. So a lot of games will be showcased
 cathy#3897: playing through 1000 games would be SUCH a headache
 JuliusCube#8501: if you get top 100 theres a high likelyhood that your game gets into the video and theres a 1/5 chance that he picks your game
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: I mean, if enough people start using Dice as singular, then English can change
 BatYaggy#3015: 100
 Delphine Noel#1196: everything other than the playable files can be changed
 The Handsome  Cat#6115: How the rating system works ? +1  ?
 nicholas#8278: ye
 Peewi#8572: Yes. Just edit your page. Only uploads are locked
 wyrm_slayr#7477: Just double checking, can I change my game's thumbnail without un-entering the jam?
 JJfriends#3686: I thought it was top 1000
 Scolon#4218: Mark plays the top 100 and then he picks who gets in the video from there, obviously he  can't showcase all of them as that'd take too long. He won't necessarily only show  the top of the top.
 JuliusCube#8501: you can, but according to classic grammar rules that is not allowed. Not like classic grammar rules stop us from saying things like "gonna" instead of "going to" or anything like that. If the gradual change from "die" to "dice" is because of the alternate meaning of the word "die", then that makes sense. people tend to avoid death.
 nicholas#8278: what is your game
 JJfriends#3686: I got last place last year so ya know..
 Jamesor#6153: Btw is there anyone down for rating our game? We are students so we could really use some feedback. You guys made some amazing games btw, I’m really motivated playing some of these
 nekotheasparagus#0809: That’s in the top 2%, I’d just be happy if people like it
 syelan34#3258: I would love that too, even as background footage lol
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: getting in the video when only the top 20 (or top 10? top 20 seems like too much) get in the video is not likely
 Delphine Noel#1196: getting in the video is literally winning
 Scolon#4218: Yeah I find the comments way more interesting to look at
 King Sol#2650: I feel like as far as feedback goes spelling is very inconsequential  to an aspiring developers growth. English wont be every developers first language and I'm sure it's more important they focus their energy on creating better game mechanics.
 JJfriends#3686: I got 10 so far 🥶 I hope I can at least make in the video if possible
 syelan34#3258: Tbh I just want to see what people say about my game
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: without any other details I'm not sure sorry
 RGBCube#8833: oh hello nicholas wasn't expecting to see you here lol
 Arkeon#9826: Can't we say "dice" in the singular form?
 Scolon#4218: Itch.io has systems in place to make sure the ratings your game gets are weighted properly, don't worry if you have less ratings than another game. (You'll get more as time goes on anyways)
 JJfriends#3686: People are gonna be like: die?? I don't supporting dying 0/5
 nicholas#8278: lol
 Uthel#6594: am I able to add an alternate build to an already submitted game? I built for webgl but should probably include a standalone windows, since performance seems to be an issue 😛
 nekotheasparagus#0809: I’m just trying to figure out what the stars I’m seeing in the submission feed mean. I’ve only rated one game, and it’s not the ones I’m seeing
 syelan34#3258: I mean I don’t think the number of ratings matters either, probably just the highest rated
 RGBCube#8833: i dont think i accidentally slipped up, but i might wanna check that lol
 Scolon#4218: Yeah you don't get to see a star rating either
You just get to see your placement relative to everyone
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: you can't see the jam ratings until the voting is over, This is intentional. When rating people focus on giving good and useful feedback so that people who made their game can learn from the experience
 syelan34#3258: That can make it fun to come up with puns with die
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: oh i dont wanna win i just want a lot of ratings to get an accurate read on what people think of my game
 AlexBR#3963: I don't think this is a hill to 🎲on
 JuliusCube#8501: if this is why, that is completely understandable.
 nicholas#8278: no
 Jamesor#6153: I’m so happy about how our game turned out, but I would have love an extra hour for more polishing… We barely managed to test the final build lol
 shim#5566: Is there some kind of prize for winning? Wondering why people seem to care so much about it 🙂
 Peewi#8572: It annoys me too. It especially annoys me that a high profile game like Dicey Dungeons uses dice as a singular
 clay#7015: The problem with “die” is the other meaning of the word, makes it confusing and has really strong connotations. Personally I prefer dice as the singular
 syelan34#3258: You can only see your own vote, not anyone else’s
 JuliusCube#8501: I keep seeing people mess this up:
🎲   == "die"
🎲 🎲 🎲    == "dice"
in games i often see people using the plural instead of the singular form.
it's not like it matters or anything though.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i mean i do have fun playing these i just also REALLY need the karma
 Scolon#4218: There was a dice factory game I saw that i had way too much fun on
The sound effects were just too good
 nekotheasparagus#0809: I thought we weren’t supposed to be able to see them?
 JJfriends#3686: Y'all should play my game for fun ya know
 ChipmunkDev#1808: turns out the reason my build failed was a typo in the compile script >:o
 syelan34#3258: Do you mean the ratings? That’s how you vote on how good the game is
 King Sol#2650: Soon you will have a catalogue of 300 games
 RGBCube#8833: i just came out of this game jam
and for some reason i chose to enter a second one with my friend lol
 Scolon#4218: Each game roughly takes about 2-5 minutes to play
Unless it's a particularly addicting game and you just can't stop playing
 SkullbombRaging#9388: I think I accidentally managed to make my game unplayable because I had put it as optional donation... can anyone see it?
 Ceding Tree#1081: 7 days
 Schmuff#7990: do we know about how long we have to rate games until the ratings are locked and the top 100 are picked
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: this is actually one of my favorite things for your team's game, it shows you have ways to get around a jam. it's smart and works in the context it's in
 nekotheasparagus#0809: There’s a whole page that was just games with no ratings when I checked it, at this point I think everyone might have at least 1 rating
Random question - what do the stars I see over comments in the submission feed mean?
 FireSquid#8882: Depends on if you actually want to rate them accurately or not
 syelan34#3258: Yeah, it’s only public at that point because that way the top 100 aren’t spoiled
 BatYaggy#3015: Ah I see
 MetalGearSamus#0001: That's 1 game every 14 mins for 24 hours
 Schmuff#7990: yeah you can't see the actual scores of ratings. I think you can see your total scores after the jam rating is over?
 Ceding Tree#1081: Then youve been rated by 3 people
 BatYaggy#3015: I only see "Rated by 3 people so far"
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: The animation here wasn't too crazy. We just made some pieces wobble. It was fun. But, we lost a whole enemy that also had the animations integrated.
 Agentlion#1893: gonna smash through a bunch of submissions tonight, these are really fun
 nekotheasparagus#0809: If you get 100 short games probably doable
 swarm#1128: So many good games
 Scolon#4218: When mark uploads his video
 syelan34#3258: I’ve mostly been looking at low numbers of ratings
 Ceding Tree#1081: 24 hours * 60 minutes = 1440 minutes to rate games. So feasiable I think
 Schmuff#7990: when do the top 100 get chosen? I can't see a date or time anywhere on the jam page
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: how feasable would it be to rate 100 games in a day
 Peewi#8572: On the game page, click the "rate for game jam" thing in the top right and it says how many ratings it has
 BatYaggy#3015: ty
The only animation I did for my game, I scrapped.
 MetalGearSamus#0001: Wow
 Scolon#4218: Wait... did anyone make a game about a die taking a huge dump in the bathroom or something..>
 L3mmy♡#2307: If anyone played "Dices of Fate" by Clive dev, that's our team game, I'll make sure to rate everyone's game who leaves a comment giving feedback on it!
 piguman3#4088: 😩 🎲 👍
 Scolon#4218: 🧻 🎲
 Lawn#1538: 🎲
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: you go to your submission's page and look near the "add to collection" button
 syelan34#3258: Go on the submission page for your game on the jam and it will say it on the right
 Lex#2782: if anyone wants me to play their game send it to my dms :)
 Bean01#2366: same! it is just so perfect of a game and really well implemented
 piguman3#4088: Who made "the masterpiece"?
 BatYaggy#3015: how do u check ur ratings
 Omniclause#4760: just checked it out it was very good.  My favorite game of the jam so far.  It got 5s across the board from me.
 syelan34#3258: Yeah my analytics page hasn’t updated the ratings, super weird
 piguman3#4088: Bruh i just code my own friends
 BatYaggy#3015: unfortunate
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: OH this is so confusing for no reason at all. i actually got 5 ratings so far. well that's good to see!
 krisis in a jar#0904: Send me your games so i can rate them!
 JuliusCube#8501: no thank you my friend state is locked and i shall be lonely forever.
 CadenJO [DM to trade ratings]#2365: how many ratings rn is good
 Scolon#4218: btw, people worrying about their game's current ratings
Most of the people participating in the jam burnt out and aren't going to play until tomorrow/later in the week, you'll get a lot of plays later down the line as long as you're doing the same
 BatYaggy#3015: I shall be ur friend
 syelan34#3258: I’m not sure about the ones not about dice, but a lot of people ended up not finding bugs in their games before submitting, and also there is this one glitch that causes some I think unity games to not work
 krisis in a jar#0904: Quite a lot of people are starting to rate my game...
 JuliusCube#8501: I saw a game with "Friends may be required for use of this product." in the description and i just realized that its impossible for me to play that game because of that.
 BatYaggy#3015: Ya I came a cross those too
 Scolon#4218: I've seen a few really well polished ideas
That are definitely top 100
 Bean01#2366: also, i noticed that there are so many games I came across that dont actually work. is that normal? there were like 2 completely unplayable and like 5 that had nothing to do with dice at all
 BatYaggy#3015: I think it may be one of the winners.
Wanna try my game?
 JuliusCube#8501: oh crap that wouldve been a good name for my game
oh well imma just roll with it anyway
 The Handsome  Cat#6115: I forgot to playtest the game, and the restart button and the last level dose not work
 xono#1000: so i was added as an admin and my teammate submitted our game, but when i comment it doesnt say i submitted any game
 krisis in a jar#0904: Oh, i think i saw your game, i was so confused lol
 syelan34#3258: I remember loving the name of this one game, “just roll with it”
 Bean01#2366: yea this is hard. i didnt realize but theres also a timer. when it runs out, more people spawn and the old ones stay. so i got overwhelmed really quick. super hard
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i got notifications for comments (people being very kind! thank you!) but the analytics page is counting 0 comments
 Scolon#4218: There's two different comment pages
 not without text#5469: for my game, since the actual page doesn't work i put a p5.js project in the description. if you press the "" for the code, you can plainly see on the code page that the code has not been updated for 6 hours. is that ok? (wondering because of the "there's a bug! go to this link!" situation mentioned in the rules)
 The Handsome  Cat#6115: How can you tell ?
 Scolon#4218: do it to em
 JuliusCube#8501: rate other people's games and give them feedback!
 AnthonyC#4770: do unto others as you wish to be done unto you
 Schmuff#7990: What's the play to get more people to rate your game and give feedback
 JuliusCube#8501: just so you guys know it might be a good idea to put the link to your game in your discord bio
 birdstone#3073: definitely
 fibοηezrα#0727: Simple is the way to go I reckon
 Peewi#8572: Did anyone call their game Dice Hard?
 birdstone#3073: Oh mine's one word
 fibοηezrα#0727: I’ll take a look at it. I’m surprised at how long the average game name is. Not sure if I’ve seen any with 1 word yet.
 piguman3#4088: Pollo 👍
 Delphine Noel#1196: you died? that's a bug just reload the game. i forgot about that one. everytime you want to restart just reload
 BatYaggy#3015: Ya its fun, the knights are bullying me tho
 Techno#1832: yes this
 JuliusCube#8501: ive played 3 of those already.
there's one called roll control which i really enjoyed.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: my analytics page is being weird i definitely got 2-3 comments for my entry but it's still showing 0 comments on it
 The Handsome  Cat#6115: In the gmtk in 2020 I submitted my game on private lol
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: the borg...
 Wenlong#7472: There's oddly a lot of games with chess elements? I had them as enemies but only because I can't draw
 Tyrix#6647: You will eventually win by having everyone on your team and making the only submission!
 BatYaggy#3015: Mine is "Random Object Spinulator"
 CyberWitch#3879: Do you have to do anything special to make a game maker game work on mac?
 piguman3#4088: Why does the game crash randomly
 tomster12#7972: i mean mines called *onion* if thats far enough different
 Bean01#2366: lmao!!! you should try it. I played it so many times, i just loved it
 FryDev#0372: what’s the name of the game you made
 JuliusCube#8501: mine is "Shifting Sum" and it has absolutely no correlation to my game whatsoever but it doesnt have dice in it
 BatYaggy#3015: it is not your pawn either
 Bean01#2366: i found a game on the jam that I found extremely cool and wanted to share. (it is not my game)
 fibοηezrα#0727: Ironically names that aren’t  dice-related stand out
 Viola_Buddy#6763: 👍 Roll a 50-sided die and avoid getting a 1? I'll take those odds.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Yeah. About double the size from last year. Lol. We ended up making something that has *way more* potential than our last years entry. I don't think we'll win. But, we made something pretty solid. Came down to the wire, tho. We were still integrating mechanics and animations and ai down to the last hour.
 Lawn#1538: The remaining 2% is indifferent.
 Lawn#1538: I'm like 98% certain your ratings are anonymous.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: for going solo i think i did pretty well
 Fox#3756: I also went solo, but it sure gets tight in 48 hours.
 Viola_Buddy#6763: Are our ratings on itch.io anonymous? (Obviously any actual comments aren't.)
 Lawn#1538: A step up from last year yeah?
 Lawn#1538: How was the big team  ?
 EW#3256: solodev gaming,(what i made is another story)
 jonny.h#9467: frrrr
 Relis#1309: 😂
 FryDev#0372: I went solo, probably not the best decision since I ended up with an unplayable game
 Delphine Noel#1196: I guess most of them are named rolling dice
 JuliusCube#8501: it seems in this jam you either get titles like "dicefending the dice" or "interdimensional hypercube"
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Who won btw?
 jonny.h#9467: yo did anyone else make a racing game lol
 SparkerXof#3127: DM me. I want to try more games.
 Lawn#1538: But also, puns and word play are the best.
 JJfriends#3686: 7 ratings so far if we keep pushing we can do it
 Lex#2782: if anyone wants me to play their game send it to my dms :)
 jonny.h#9467: ^
 Ceding Tree#1081: DM the link, I will check it out!
 JuliusCube#8501: okay, fair enough
 The Handsome  Cat#6115: Hey, dose anyone wanna try my game, just the restart button and the last level dose not work, in rest it's fine
 Delphine Noel#1196: I dmed you bro
 Lawn#1538: Because why not!
 piguman3#4088: Gimme link :(
 Delphine Noel#1196: i ported my game for linux but didn't upload because servers failed last moment and I didn't want to risk it for something not required
 SparkerXof#3127: ~5
 The Handsome  Cat#6115: 0 ratings on my game, progress
 JuliusCube#8501: no i mean like names with pointless "dice"-s thrown in
for example "dicefending the dice" which is a great game but why is there a dice in defending.
 Falcon#3043: Bye
 Ceding Tree#1081: Gotta say, this is the most fun I've had in a weekend in a long time!
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Bye
 Lawn#1538: My juice game is going to popping off by January.
 piguman3#4088: If you didn't port your game to the raspberry pi you aren't a true dev B)
 theChief#0001: January!
 Falcon#3043: Hi
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Hi
 Lawn#1538: Bring on JUICE JAM 
 Lawn#1538: I am not a mod, merely a lowly helper for this game jam. I did nothing but put my hand up for it, but I'm semi-active in the Patron side of this server so maybe that counted for something.
 theChief#0001: Everyone's favourite mini mod is going to be hosting an accessibility jam in September!
 Falcon#3043: 9
 Scolon#4218: Alright, I'll play more games tomorrow, break time
 piguman3#4088: 7
 The Handsome  Cat#6115: Big father brakeys is hosting a gamejam ?
 Tyrix#6647: brackets yt yes, jam is still going on
 theChief#0001: Still doing jams! Not sure how much brackeys himself has to do with them lol
 Indigu#6862: Which game has the highest rating right now?
 Lawn#1538: His spirit lives on in his community!
 King Sol#2650: I thought Brackey was gone
 Michel#2879: "guys dm me your game if u want me to try it"
"you can also try my game"
how many times did this happen to u fuys
 coolhotdogguy#4788: How many games have you all rated?
 piguman3#4088: That or the name
 Lawn#1538:  Other big jams include the Brackeys Jam, Unity's Global Game Jam, and GitHub's GameOff. There's all sorts of jams for all sorts of things.
 The Handsome  Cat#6115: How did u become a mod ? Just curious :)
 Delphine Noel#1196: You want link?
 Falcon#3043: 2 ratings reviewed 9 games
 Peewi#8572: it's a mechanic. If you rate other submissions, your submission is more likely to be shown near the top of the random submissions page
 piguman3#4088: Which one
 SparkerXof#3127: Ah, yes, I thought about actual frameworks like SFML.
 Fox#3756: I marked it as "didn't make all the music in this jam" because I used one of my old songs I didn't know what else to do with. I think art is more likely to have bespoke requirements, which is probably why people rather focused on custom art than custom music.
 zyugyzarc#0314: i think its like reddit karma but on itch
 Scolon#4218: It's a mechanic for the jam
 Delphine Noel#1196: platformer
 Tyrix#6647: yes
 King Sol#2650: Is karma a mechanic of the jam, or are people referring to superstitious karma?
 Toboter#5206: Scratch best 3D engine
 birdstone#3073: i've got 19 right now and i've only played like 2 games, when I get more time later i'll play way more
 piguman3#4088: What game did you submit?
 Falcon#3043: i would assume so
 Delphine Noel#1196: Pico 8 is everything
 NerdyAlien#0745: can i post the game again if the 6 hour timer is up?
 Peewi#8572: 4. But I also haven't rated anyone else's games to get karma yet.
 birdstone#3073: That's true lol
 Toboter#5206: I mean, it's a sliding scale from an engine to a framework.
 Lawn#1538: They are happening all of the time, just check the schedule on itch.io
 piguman3#4088: Is pico 8 a platform or an engine?
 CadenJO [DM to trade ratings]#2365: how many ratings do you guys have on your games rn
 Michel#2879: well you can still technically write code for any language in that
 MHG#7304: Hey sorry if this was answered already. My cover photo on my itch.io page never seemed to go thru. Is it okay to update that or will that disqualify me?
 Lawn#1538: Contrast helps too!
 Delphine Noel#1196: for art its 4:1 for yes:no and for music it's 3:3
 SparkerXof#3127: They are frameworks, as I know.
 The Handsome  Cat#6115: Hey, when there will be a good and popular gamejam to take part on ?
 coolhotdogguy#4788: Color transcends language! But as all of us here know, some people have color blindness
 zyugyzarc#0314: thats alright, ive made stuff with no engine and a barebones terminal before
 birdstone#3073: indeed, ~~i made my game with notepad++~~
 Falcon#3043: 3k made their music 5k made their art not exactly hundreds vs thousands
 Toboter#5206: Also, Mono and libGDX, but they are more technical.
 GavRaz#6261: i agree
 Delphine Noel#1196: I want to try some javascript game engines but I can never understand them. They always assume you already know how to do stuff
 Poweries#8748: dm me if you want me to check out your game!
 Michel#2879: you c what he did there?
seems like you csharp
 Lawn#1538: All engines are valid. What matters are the games that are made with them.
 Toboter#5206: Godot fits your bill.
 piguman3#4088: If you didn't port to the raspberry pi too your game stinks B)
 Delphine Noel#1196: from the top three game engines you say don't count one or two and then wonder what will be the third
 King Sol#2650: Roblox 😄
 GavRaz#6261: godot kinda sick, epic engine
 zyugyzarc#0314: right i forgot about godot
 Lawn#1538: MonoGame is another option.
 Delphine Noel#1196: neither lol I'm learning art right now can't make it in two days
 Tyrix#6647: I mean ... Godot?
 Lawn#1538: Godot is the one everyone raves about.
 Lawn#1538: Yeah, I use colour a lot in my games. It's one of the simplest communication tools in this medium, and it works every time.
 Scolon#4218: I barely had time to make my own music, I was really cutting it  close
 Falcon#3043: Add some screenshots, maybe a gif, post in game jam review my game and pray
 coolhotdogguy#4788: What did you do?
 zyugyzarc#0314: ok guys, whats a good game engine that you would suggest (other than unity/unreal) (extra points if open source)
 Lawn#1538: Ahh yes, there's always a trade offs like that in a jam. You'll get 'em next time. At least you managed to keep your scope creep at bay.
 Fox#3756: Yeah; it pains me to imagine all the polish I could have added if I had one more day. But that'll always be true, so eh. I do like 72 hour jams a bit better though. Gives me more breathing room too.
 Delphine Noel#1196: most people made their own art, but only a couple hundred made their own music
 MaverickHorn#2838: rate other games and write comments
 Poweries#8748: my game is broken but if you guys want to try it then its called "Not SO Nice Dice"
 coolhotdogguy#4788: Granted I used text for the pause menu and points, you could take those away and my game would still work. I just tried to focusing on making it as simple as I could.  Used like matching colors to communicate instead of text
 NerdyAlien#0745: is there a way to get more people to rate my game?
 Scolon#4218: Not until the end
 King Sol#2650: My biggest regret is not knowing how to WebGL before the Game Jam I feel like I'll get significantly less response because of it
 Falcon#3043: or rather cause coming up with names is hard
 NerdyAlien#0745: is there a way to tell what position i'm at?
 Wenlong#7472: I just couldn't think of a name for my game at all :D
 AlpalcaLad#2549: I did try to find some other solutions but they were a bit too time intensive to implement. If I was to make it a long term project for sure I’d use something else but quite a few design options are locked off based on time investment from the start
 Delphine Noel#1196: Some people do that just cause they're scared that someone might mistake their game for not following the theme. If it's in the name at least you won't be like, the guy has no idea
 Lawn#1538: This is generally the opposite of what you want to do. Mo scope, mo problems.
 CadenJO [DM to trade ratings]#2365: how can i invite my teammate to join the discord?
 Delphine Noel#1196: I will try to make my scope larger and larger slowly
 Lawn#1538: Is there a way text could be avoided?
 Lawn#1538: Sounds like a design problem
 Fox#3756: True, but it's helpful to have something they can go look at if they get stuck. I've been thinking about doing my "tutorial"/instructions as a resource they can access while playing the game only if they need to, but didn't have time to implement that this time.
 EW#3256: antepiece is the cooler "tutorial"
 JuliusCube#8501: There are too many games with either "dice" or "roll" in their name in this jam.
 Delphine Noel#1196: I knew this would happen with me, so I kept my scope so small this time, That even though I slept for most of the time, I actually did finish it
 King Sol#2650: To be fair I skimmed the rules to the entire gameJam because I didn't have time! lol
 coolhotdogguy#4788: I’m actually pretty proud with how intuitive my game ended up being. Granted I was inspired by Doodle Jump, which is very intuitive
 MetalGearSamus#0001: Yeah I don't even read the text in discord chats, I just guess
 R2D2Vader#0693: I literally do that lol
 AlpalcaLad#2549: Yeah I can’t get too mad when I would do the exact same thing
 EW#3256: cant read a desciprtion if my game dont have one
 Delphine Noel#1196: This a very big thing in gaming. Gamers hate text in all forms.
 MaverickHorn#2838: I am one of this 😦
 Boug#9534: Yeah, that's the right way I think. My idea was too complex this year so I didn't have time to playtest it. Too worried trying to make the basics work
 Scolon#4218: Also you can't "farm karma" by just going to each game and rating them as fast as possible
Itch.io has detection algorithms in place for whether your ratings are genuine or not, so don't try to cheat the system
 King Sol#2650: Yeah, I liked having a deadline. but I think 48 hours was Juuuuust a little too short for me to be completely satisfied.
 Delphine Noel#1196: It;s really interesting to see how varied games everyone makes from the same phrase
 AlpalcaLad#2549: In my testing everyone skips all the text and then gets upset when they don’t know what to do lol
 Fox#3756: I've been trying to make my games more intuitive, but it always spirals out of control in complexity. Back to practising, I guess. Also, with game jam games, I usually don't have enough time to make enough levels to gradually introduce concepts, which is a shame.
 King Sol#2650: I think it's down to the format, you don't have to visit the page to download the game during the jam
 coolhotdogguy#4788: It’s tricky! You think you make something simple then you give it to someone to play and they do something completely different than what you expect!
 Nick#4915: I usually try to just throw some text on the screen that tells you how to start, based on feedback from friends.
 Delphine Noel#1196: most people don't read description before playing
 King Sol#2650: I did, but they still got confused I guess lol
 Boug#9534: That's very common in my experience. Last year I manage to do a pretty intuitive game, but don't know if I got it this time
 Fox#3756: You can still write some detailed instructions in the description at least.
 coolhotdogguy#4788: Yeah I’ve had the issue before too. This time I tried to make a game that was super simple and intuitive so ideally people wouldn’t need to read instructions.
 Maurum#2530: DM if you want to trade games to review!
 Delphine Noel#1196: you should learn how to make games more accessible, there were a lot of tricks done in the original mario game for this reason. You can learn from that
 britsplease#1920: Yeah, I know the feeling. Especially if you need a tutorial, then the game is complex enough that you spent a lot of time already with the mechanics so it just feels too much
 King Sol#2650: Yeah, most of my feedback is that it's unclear what to do. I really regret not doing a tutorial.
 Fox#3756: Usually when I write instructions, it just confuses people further, and this time is no different. Sigh.
 Nick#4915: Agreed. I was thinking I put close to 40 hours in the timeframe of 2 days. That's a whole workweek.
 snuffysam#2767: There is a “sort games by karma” filter which I plan on using to pick which games to rate
 krisis in a jar#0904: That's nice
 Scolon#4218: Yes there is. Karma will boost you up on the front page and make your game more likely to appear in random queue
If your game already has a lot of ratings compared to other games though it will have pretty much no effect.
So if you had like 500 ratings but the average ratings per game was around 20, karma would do literally nothing since you game was overplayed.
Other than that, don't really know how the algorithm works
 Taccos#1054: game jams are fun but it would be torture to do some in a row
 Delphine Noel#1196: I thought no one would come across my bug, but apparently someone did rip
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i gave maybe 20 and received no ratings yet i think... if the analytics page is to be trusted?
 snuffysam#2767: I wanted to have a tutorial level but I didn’t have time ):
 Nick#4915: Yea, I think there's a rough system for that.
 BatYaggy#3015: Mine doesnt even have dice!
 MaverickHorn#2838: you evil genious! You mind played me
 Pillar Monkey#0932: is there a karma system for ratings, like there is for ludum dare? i've given out maybe 20 ratings and comments but only received 4
 DevByMarc#7784: I think i might need to add mine in the description then
 britsplease#1920: I always spend too much time to make in-game tutorials because I'm too afraid poeple won't read the description
 dhafo#4640: my game is basically the newer deus ex games
 krisis in a jar#0904: Same
 Fox#3756: That's my strategy: attract players based on palette preferences.
 Scolon#4218: Also, friendly reminder, be sure to include controls/instructions in your game's description. It really helps a lot.
 MaverickHorn#2838: first step... Research
 hulgarth#8598: lol
 kablouser#4232: That describes our game perfectly 😢
 MetalGearSamus#0001: if morning:
smoke 2 joints
if night:
smoke 2 joints:
if afternoon:
smoke 2 joints
alright = true
 britsplease#1920: Only after the rating period
 Delphine Noel#1196: you can't untill the end. You can only see how many have rated
 gnarbro#1627: Hey everyone, do you know how to see what people have rated your game so far?
 MaverickHorn#2838: I Played this one, because it was the same palette 😄 Nice Art
 Toliman#7817: If someone wants I can check out their game. (DM)
 hulgarth#8598: I thought about a game where you roll joints of weed from a strain called dice, but couldnt come up with how I would do the core loop 🙂
 King Sol#2650: I've seen people use it as dice up enemies with swords. I thought about a lot of these things too because I don't like RNG based games.
 Fox#3756: The King's Gambit; a sort of strategy/tactics/minesweeper mashup.
 Ber#3410: nothing because it wont
 hulgarth#8598: I pondered an idea with that chopping food and putting it on a roll but couldn't think of a fun core loop 🙂
 britsplease#1920: SOmeone aked about this in the chat after the theme reveal so there might be some somewhere
 MaverickHorn#2838: you mean you used the exact same palette for your game, like I for my avatar 🙂 what's your game
 King Sol#2650: Panic
 Delphine Noel#1196: You know I wonder if people will think that my game doesn't follow the theme. Because there's no randomisation. But like the main character is a dice and it rolls
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i'm pretty sure 50% of stuff that has been sent has been puns with the word die. i just went for the delicious arcadey feel "super space dice blasters" has that "nonsense string of words from the 90s" flair to it
 Wenlong#7472: I'm surprised I'm not seeing games that interpret "dice" as food cut in small pieces... Like try and roll into the right pot from the cutting board or sth?
 hulgarth#8598: My dice needs to get to the goal point using place able objects to alter its path
 Lex#2782: if anyone wants me to play their game send it to my dms :)
 Poweries#8748: wanna check out my game?
 krisis in a jar#0904: What will you do if your game gets in the top 10?
 Fox#3756: Also, your avatar seems to be using the exact palette I used for my art, lol
 NalaFala38290#9305: my game has a die that can die
 Ber#3410: mine has a randomly spawning dice but if its in a certain area it wont spawn 😃
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: i do a thing like this
 coolhotdogguy#4788: My game only has the one die...so no dice
 Scolon#4218: My game has dice literally everywhere
 Princent Vice#4280: Good work everybody. See you next year
 krisis in a jar#0904: I don't remember the name
 MaverickHorn#2838: multi layered
 Viciouz6#4491: I have always used unity webgl and never had before with fullscreen before, but then again this time I used a newer Unity version. Why do I never learn
 Poweries#8748: I made a game where a dice rolls itself and when it lands a random events will happen like lava, water or crystals and there are 3 breakers around the building. You have to break find and break them and when you do the the dice will lose some health and then a grace period will happen for a minute and then the dice will roll itself again. My game is called "Not So Nice Dice" and my user is GameDev_p.
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: my game doesn't work ||for MacOSX||
 Delphine Noel#1196: lol Now I'm worried if you played my game
 Fox#3756: lol, in that way, it's even MORE related to the theme.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: this is true. HOWEVER. dice themselves are so deliciously satisfying
 Ber#3410: fr? what is it
 krisis in a jar#0904: Nope, it was just a platformer. The word *dice* was mentioned once in the whole game
 King Sol#2650: Haha, mine was a play on the pronunciation of dice. In my game you roll up the souls of the "Dies" a derogatory slur Grim Reapers use to refer to dead people.
 MaverickHorn#2838: like having no dice in your game 😄 Just kidding
 piguman3#4088: Yea my enemies are just random sprites with random names and random positions and random bullets and random thoughts
 Scolon#4218: Also, I've found a few games that literally just don't work. That's sad
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: what's up gguy
 EnergyDashClarko#4158: 😄
 Ber#3410: im crying 😭 beautiful name
 Delphine Noel#1196: it could also have randomization. Or it could also be just a mistake. I submitted a wrong game by mistake.
 Fox#3756: I have no dice in mine; I sort of interpreted "roll of the dice" as "doing risky things in the hope that it'll be good".
 Nick#4915: Something can be a "roll of the dice" without having visible dice. (imo)
 Viciouz6#4491: UI not layout wise, only that text just becomes invisible. Makes no sense
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i made a game. i think. allegedly
 Scolon#4218: I mean yeah you don't need to have dice in your game
 krisis in a jar#0904: Yes, i found a game platformer game that has nothing to do with the theme
 MaverickHorn#2838: you can't trust anyone 😦
 Wenlong#7472: Actually what IS a puzzle game anyway? What separates it from strategy? I always had problem picking my game genre on itch
 S4B3R#9060: what 💀
 piguman3#4088: I made a game about dkjdjehejskoqaidbrbuflaoepfurb
 King Sol#2650: Did anyone else not even have any dice in their game?
 DevByMarc#7784: UI stuff?
 Delphine Noel#1196: I made a platformer. but I was mostly checking the waters than actually try to make a real game
 EnergyDashClarko#4158: we made game how we hate dice... because... no more dice, EVER AGAIN 😠
 Ber#3410: 😔 so sad
 Viciouz6#4491: My text disappears
 krisis in a jar#0904: It's like a triangle but with 4 faces
 MaverickHorn#2838: Every year the same. Last Jam I made a game about connections and everyone stolen it
 Poweries#8748: does anyone want to try my game?
 wren#0640: whats a dice???
 britsplease#1920: Breaks it in what way?
 NalaFala38290#9305: plagiarism
 S4B3R#9060: thats y you gotta think outside the box cos everyone is gonna do a puzzle game lol
 Ber#3410: they stole your game idea 😱😱😱😱😱😱 omggmgmgmgmgmgmgm
 Viciouz6#4491: I cannot figure out the life of me why full screen on itch.io breaks my Unity game, has anyone ever experienced anything similiar?
 krisis in a jar#0904: What a coincidence, am i right?
 theChief#0001: Snap
 theChief#0001: Keep game links to 
 Teslobo#8274: post links in  , not here
 Scolon#4218: From what I've seen so far, the two most common types of submissions are:
Grid-based dice-rolling puzzler
Roll a dice to determine X and hope you survive
 Delphine Noel#1196: You will always have a badge on your game page letting people know that it was submitted in GMTK 2022
 MaverickHorn#2838: wtf!?!
 Ber#3410: nahhh fr!!?!??!?!?!?!?!?! NAHHHHHH
 krisis in a jar#0904: No way! I also made a game about dice!
 Hobusu#5033: Yes! Once the voting is over, your game is yours to do with as you wish
 Delphine Noel#1196: this theme was made for puzzle games
 britsplease#1920: I'd decided that this year I won't make a puzzle game as always, but in the end I made a puzzle game:(
 S4B3R#9060: rpg idea seems cool, i made a wave shooter where you kill little dice with really dumb weapons lmfao like a fart gun
 MaverickHorn#2838: I made a game about dice
 Ber#3410: when the gamejams over does itch let us add a new version?
 Amitgep#9295: I made top down shooter
 krisis in a jar#0904: i made a bullet-hell game
 coolhotdogguy#4788: i made an endless scroller
 piguman3#4088: I made an asteroid game
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i made a shmup
 Teslobo#8274: I've seen several RPGs and some shooters
 Ber#3410: idk if breakout is a puzzle game
 MetalGearSamus#0001: I did
 S4B3R#9060: has everyone pretty much just made puzzle games
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: now im just imagining a new kinda guy who uploads a completely empty unity project and the description's like "press z to shot press space to jamp. [UPDATE] pease go play this version it's the good one" and the link is like the steam store page to like, ultrakill
 birdstone#3073: I needed to reread that lol
 Ber#3410: its my games name tho
 DevByMarc#7784: Bruh
 Scolon#4218: He's taking his Dice Out
 Ber#3410: thats honestly surprising
 Teslobo#8274: Not at all, just don't make the game link your nickname
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: what if my game had a link to the steam store page for undertale.
 theChief#0001: Nope!
 Ber#3410: is there a rule for if we put our games name as our nickname
 Hobusu#5033: > Please do not put links to other builds (such as "Game jam upload has a bug! Please play this one!”) in your description or comments. This may see you being disqualified from the jam. Whatever you upload before the jam closes is what people will play and judge.
 theChief#0001: You would not be allowed to do this, unfortunately we can't make any exceptions!
 Teslobo#8274: Hi, sorry to hear that. We aren't allowing any updates of the game file past the deadline
 SaadTheGlad#9716: Unfortunately you are not
 britsplease#1920: After naming all my classes "Dice" I felt a bit bad when I learnt this, but it turns out that "dice" is also acceptable as the singular form
 Delphine Noel#1196: rage game
 272354#2943: 
pretty sure i know the answer, but i wanted to check - we discovered a typo in our code that was introduced while preparing the game for upload  completely breaks it. are we allowed to post an updated link on the itch.up page, or do we just have to drop out?
thanks!
 Nikyy#5562: I have 0 hehe
 MetalGearSamus#0001: russian roulette
 Ber#3410: but my game took a few hours to make i spent a day thinking of what to make
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: what if my game was just rolling a dice that had sixes all around except one face which was a 1 and you would immediately lose after hitting that one.
 theChief#0001: It has only been a few hours - don't get hung up on the number of ratings!
 S4B3R#9060: i called my game 'die!' lmao its literally about murdering innocent little dice with stupid weapons
 Teslobo#8274: 6 ratings is 6 ratings regardless of the game attached to them
 1183#1183: Today I learned that singular of dice is die, and that dice is a plural, so this weekend is not wasted
 Delphine Noel#1196: don't focus on that
 Ber#3410: is 6 ratings good for a breakout themed game
 King Sol#2650: Well I have 2 comments and 2 ratings! Both from (I suspect) the same people! lol
 Ber#3410: wait nvm i checks submission page i have 6 ratings :D
 theChief#0001: Are you looking at the game page or the jam submission page?
 Delphine Noel#1196: are you talking about comments or ratings
 Ber#3410: im confused on my games page i dont see any numbers above any of my buttons
 S4B3R#9060: smh nobody elses game has fart guns? whats wrong with you all
 Wenlong#7472: HOW DO YOU GET 14 the average is 3~4
 Teslobo#8274: I'll look into adding it to  maybe
 King Sol#2650: I have 2 ratings and they've both been people who have said in here "DM me your game and I'll play it" lol
 Michel#2879: why do I always read nvm as Nava's virtual machine lol
 Scolon#4218: We should probably get a pinned post about this lol
 Ber#3410: how do i check my ratings 😭
wait nvm
 coolhotdogguy#4788: Thank you, I'm sittin' at 14!
 DevByMarc#7784: I got 7, Ill be playing other entries as well later this day
 Michel#2879: if it's a game breaking bug you can contact Mark i think. If it's a normal bug they won't let you update it before voting era ends
 Teslobo#8274: The deadline has passed unfortunately, the file you have submitted is final
 Delphine Noel#1196: You should rate other people's game, they will rate yours as well. It's mutual work. Don't just expect people to rate your game while you don't rate any.
 Wenlong#7472: There's a number above "Report submission" and "Add to collection" buttons on your submission page
 NalaFala38290#9305: 5
 krisis in a jar#0904: I've got 2 so far
 coolhotdogguy#4788: Where do you check how many ratings you have?
 Delphine Noel#1196: 5
 Moon문강혁#6991: I want to change the file because there was a build error in the game I posted, so I want to get help
Where can I get help?
 Michel#2879: same
 softmagic#9999: 8
 Ber#3410: 0 clue idk how to check
 dhafo#4640: 2 apparently, i dont have a web build and havent rated any yet so not sweating it rn
 bird uwu#4471: 0 lol
 krisis in a jar#0904: How many ratings yall got so far?
 Delphine Noel#1196: modern touch input applications are complete opposite of vim. there motto is, you shouldn't need to touch keyboard at all
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: sure!
 cardy64#4627: LMAOO
 Michel#2879: vim devs forgetting to add an exit button:
it's not a bug it's professional text editing
 dhafo#4640: can u link me that one in dms lol cant try now but would love to later
 Casper#6361: I'm sure there's a lot more you can do
 krisis in a jar#0904: Same here
 monke (real)#6818: no its an audio game because its a game you interact with and play
 Lyfe#8258: yo about half of the webGL games made in unity that arent running on my browser, even though other half of unity webgl games were working fine
 Michel#2879: why does vim not have an exit button tho?
I get its about professional text editing, but does addingn an exit button make it less professional tho
 Ber#3410: wouldn't that just be like an audio book then..?
 krisis in a jar#0904: The highest score i got on my game so far was 550 lmao
 Casper#6361: Audio, special peripherals
 SomeTingOdd#8346: ohhh okay, thank you!
 monke (real)#6818: there are audio games that you can play without visuals
 coolhotdogguy#4788: So true! Then the player inevitably finds several bugs you haven't lol
 Ber#3410: 1 question
why is there option where you can make the game blind friendly..?
how would they even be able to play im confused
 Scolon#4218: You can't see until the end
 Michel#2879: Someone remade vim
 Mr_KM#2810: Not till the end I think
 SomeTingOdd#8346: does anyone know how you can see your ratings? i can see someone rated mine but i dont know what they rated it
 EnergyDashClarko#4158: You should have put exit button on somewhere in the game 😛
Yet, nice one, good job)
 Casper#6361: There's a bunch every year. Imo it's really fun to watch people play your game
 Teslobo#8274: People post stream links in , possibly someone doing it there
 Scolon#4218: You can probably just search gmtk on twitch/youtube or something
 coolhotdogguy#4788: Does any know of any other streamers that will be playing these games? Is there interest in that?
 Ber#3410: i wanna see rating i have
 Teslobo#8274: I imagine everyone was burned out and went to sleep
 Scolon#4218: Mark said earlier definitely no stream on monday/tuesday
Other than that no one knows when he will stream, he will announce it though
 Teslobo#8274: No ETA, happens when it happens!
 BatYaggy#3015: When is mark streaming?
 sqrt#9237: wow server is silent
 NalaFala38290#9305: it really does look like a 3d render
 Adab#8710: I see, thank you 🙏
 akaBl4ck#7384: gg
 Ber#3410: why the slowmode back to a minute long 😭
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Nah. It's a 2D render of Real Life.
 Michel#2879: it's under the itch page. You can see the amount of ratings written in gray color. It doesn't show the ratings tho. just the amount
 birdstone#3073: man if only i could reset my run
 sqrt#9237: wow i thought  this image was a 3d render from a game
 NalaFala38290#9305: I only have 5
 Veqsa#8120: I only have 3
 Ber#3410: i wanna add a small piece fo code to my game to make it more mobile friendly but how do i do that when the gamejam wont let you add new stuff
 Scolon#4218: Last jam the lowest rated game had 3 ratings lol
 EW#3256: earth online,the ultimate sandbox openworld coc trpg
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: It's called: Real life.
 Indigu#6862: It could still be abused, people don't stop at the expense of time
 Michel#2879: is 8 ratings good?
 Veqsa#8120: Yea sorry mb
 Scolon#4218: If your game gets linked underneath the comments you make, then yeah I'm pretty sure it affects it
 Santia#2861: bed hits different after 48h of nonstop stressing
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I'll check after I eat and maybe nap.
 sqrt#9237: what game is this
 MikeHazeJr#6582: My apologies
 theChief#0001: You have to rate a bunch of random games if you didn't submit to the jam
 Ennio#4334: I just checked me and my friend had 8
 theChief#0001: Keep jam links to 
 Adab#8710: Hello everyone ! I have a question about the karma system. I was not the one who uploaded my game, my teammate did but I am still mentioned as a contributor. If I rate games, will the karma of my game increase ? Sorry if this has already been asked :/
 Indigu#6862: Already? Would there be any sort of checks for cases where there's an abuse of multiple accounts or something
 JOJO#9627: Hey any tips for my game ? It seems like it's faster for some other computer   but idk why
 investus#9902: can that info be saved in your profile as link,
 Scolon#4218: Yeah I haven't viewed my game's page yet either, but I have a decent number of notifs
 Hex#8650: we've got one comment, apparentely the game's too random 😅
 investus#9902: how they can play your webgl, without your itch.io game link ?
 Hippo#6071: It'll pick up as the week goes on so don't feel concerned. =)
 TinyLittleStudio#2102: _you guys already have people playing your games? yeah that's not a good sign for me_
 theChief#0001: Yep!
 KingLucky#2526: it's very good to see this chat and remember some devs...
 nbnd#6973: Is it allowed to change the thumbnail after submissions closed?
 Veqsa#8120: I dont have any people that played my game yet...
that sad tbh haha
 theChief#0001: I'm a mod for the jam and I'm on 4 😂 but I haven't sorted my cover yet
 EnergyDashClarko#4158: There re so many games with downloadable .rar or .zip this year...
 birdstone#3073: jesus i only have 12 and that's surprising to me
 i'm rooting for you
 Hex#8650: gamedevs vs chairs am I right
that's a theme idea right there
 TinyLittleStudio#2102: thank you, i shall avenge my butt and hope my jam game does somehow well. i still need to add a thumbnail lol
 MikeHazeJr#6582: To be fair, did you *see* it? It's pretty good. I am one of the reviews on there, and it was one of the first links to get posted in here once the submissions closed.
 theChief#0001: Tbh I'm not TOO concerned, I see badpiggy has 80 already and they've got a decent community
 b1n4ry#5112: i hope our game will get to top 100, would be pog
 birdstone#3073: i feel very sorry for you lmao
 ikmalsaid#5408: Hi all! High ratings is not sus, at least at this kind of scale
 TinyLittleStudio#2102: yeah its a side effect of my chair. it's faulty. i need to order a new one. (i am basically sitting on metal)
 Michel#2879: amogus
 Hippo#6071: Some games are just really good and people want to talk about them to their friends.
 Toliman#7817: If someone wants I can checkout their game. DM
 theChief#0001: The most rated game has 229 ratings, which is... Suspicious
 birdstone#3073: *i'm concerned about the "pain in the butt (quite literally)"*
 King Sol#2650: Oh, I didn't see ewe's response that impressions were different
 Michel#2879: I faced a samiliar problem lol. everyone in the game page is like "the game gets very frustrating"
 MikeHazeJr#6582: I was consulting with a friend about a few brain storming ideas, and a lot of ideas fell to that side of the fence. Ended up using dice as tiles, and the tile you land on determines how far you can move. Which was like "isn't that just walking, with extra steps?" and the answer I came up with was to have the player be *required* to go that distance, not stop short, and they can only go the directions you'd have on a d-pad. Makes for a fairly interesting strategy puzzle game.
 TinyLittleStudio#2102: it's called dizard, if you find it by coincidence. just know, it was a pain in the butt to make _(quiet literally)_
 Gurki#9176: My game takes 2 seconds to finish oops
 birdstone#3073: Gotcha, i'm excited to see what you made this year lol
 Uthel#6594: I hope more people check out and rate my game - there's about 20-30 mins of gameplay (front nine holes of a golf course), but if it seems like a good idea I can always add more later, in different locations
 TinyLittleStudio#2102: not today old friend, i still have to set up my itch io page. but i have to say, my game looks awesome (despite not being an artist)
 theChief#0001: Nobody is on 500+ ratings
 wyrm_slayr#7477: Thanks
 King Sol#2650: How are some people on 500+ ratings and others on 0?
 birdstone#3073: LOL same with myself sometimes. Wanna review our games in dms?
 Hippo#6071: That sucks I'm sorry to hear that.
 N8#2718: my game really strong in graphics but in gameplay...
 theChief#0001: No, but if you get fewer than the median number of ratings itch will lower your score. You'll still be able to see the original score, though!
 wyrm_slayr#7477: Is there a minimum number of ratings required to qualify for ranking?
 Zhanko#0517: Worst part is I had time but thought everything was fine until 5min ago haha
 TinyLittleStudio#2102: _i tried to work with myself. didn't work out. i am a difficult guy. _
 birdstone#3073: Yeah, I worked with 2 other people that I know really well irl so it went very well, good communication lol
 King Sol#2650: I nearly did this too 😦
 birdstone#3073: It was a bit, we thought about music composition mechanics with dice first but I figured that might be too boring so we simplified it a bit
 Zhanko#0517: It was my first jam in solo so I didn't know that I had to compress the folder and I just put the .exe 😭 😭 😭
 TinyLittleStudio#2102: Have you been working in a team? How well did it go? _Ah germans the people of the country i live in._
 Lex#2782: if anyone wants me to play their game send it to my dms :)
 syelan34#3258: oh yeah I've heard of that, must have been somewhat difficult to adapt it to a shooter
 Teslobo#8274: People with Queues can't get new games until they play at least a couple of games from the current queue
 birdstone#3073: I did a little bit of research and found an old german musical dice game so we tried using that as an inspiration for a top down shooter
 Teslobo#8274: Your game more than likely will appear in someone's queue at some point
 Lex#2782: Not true your game was good!
 PickleOstrich#2216: Dm me the link
 JJfriends#3686: Gg so no one's gonna play my game dam
 TinyLittleStudio#2102: Yeah this time around i made something cute and little bit fun. Less blocky, more pixely.  How about you? What did ya make? _Also, i feel like i lost my butt during the endless hours of programming._
 syelan34#3258: I've had 591 lol, I don't think it matters that much
 birdstone#3073: I remember you made that like block game
 Teslobo#8274: Nope, anyone can rate but people that didn't submit a game are locked to a random queue of games and can't pick what they play/rate
 theChief#0001: Input doesn't really matter in my game, but that's because it's incredibly easy - not because it's too random 😂
 KingLucky#2526: Amazing !
 BravoDS (Music/SFX)#0694: Congratulations to everyone on whatever you have accomplished)
 Digitaldude555#5515: got 3 votes...no comments Im scared bros
 TinyLittleStudio#2102: i like review wars, yes. I participated again and this time i had more than just 10 hours of free time. I had nothing better to do the entire weekend!
 Kevin牛#6896: Are games only allowed to be rated by participants in the jam?
 GODFATHER#6766: I am so happy I had no skills whatsoever still I found a great team who worked together and finished the game. Man this community is wholesome 😄
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i did advise people to look at mark's video on input and output randomness!
 Teslobo#8274: So it's the number of times someone has had the option of opening your page
 wren#0640:  dm me your game I'd love to play it
 syelan34#3258: oh, where do I see impressions then?
 Teslobo#8274: Impressions is the number of times the thumbnail has shown up in someone's queue or search page
 birdstone#3073: HEY ITS YOU remember the review count war last gmtk jam
 BravoDS (Music/SFX)#0694: We spent almost all time on polishing and audio-visual presentation, that forgot to add actual objectives) and we didn't manage to implement 99% of sounds because of one little bug that we were able to fix, like 5 minutes after the jam)
Also had to cut 50% of gameplay features.
And what the worst part..we workd in UE5 and forgot to disable Lumen and all modern graphics options))
On my, pretty strong machine I get 1-2 FPS ))))
 Michel#2879: dm me the link pls
 theChief#0001: It is the number of times your cover image has appeared on a web page
 TinyLittleStudio#2102: i also went that far but luckly people got me back on track where it's not random anymore
 EW#3256: true random to the point where you have no idea what is going on in the game,because everything is random
 theChief#0001: I use Shapes by Freya Holmer, but it's a similar deal!
 AromaticA#3738: 515
 Teslobo#8274: I've played and voted on a handful of games now and the theme I'm starting to see is "randomness to the point that your input doesn't matter", which is a little disheartening
 birdstone#3073: Oh ours incorporates music but isn't a rhythm game lol
 syelan34#3258: damn wtf how many people are rating it
 theChief#0001: Same 😂 only it was a top down rhythm roguelike looter shooter 👀
 [Error_27]#3011: i have to go the true godot programmer art way and make a game using only the godot icon.png file some time
 Fluorescent#6450: same, only squares and occasional circles :)
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: how often do analytics for a game update? my impressions went from 44 to 515 in an instant and now they're staying at 515 for some time
 King Sol#2650: How do you add images to the screenshots page?
 birdstone#3073: i have made yet another "top down" shooter
 Hippo#6071: Ooh please DM me your game, I would love to play it later.
 coolhotdogguy#4788: Lol similar boat. I literally just used unity's square and circle sprites
 britsplease#1920: Same, same 😄 Always getting good comments on the visual style but I have no idea what I'm doing
 [Error_27]#3011: i did the opposite. i focused on getting it working and then i rushed to get the visuals to look presentable
 Julien#2204: I guess it's kind of a hard genre for a jam. I went with a tactics rpg but the rpg content is very limited
 birdstone#3073: I spent a lot of time on polish and visuals and was afraid of the gameplay lacking creativity
 EW#3256: "paint art" ™️
 theChief#0001: People seem to enjoy my visual style, but I've honed my "programmer art" to a fine point 😂
 [Error_27]#3011: somehow people have liked my art even though it was very lazy and a lot of it wasn't very good
 Scolon#4218: Similar thoughts for me tbh, if I had another day I could've done a lot more
 Hippo#6071: I'm excited to play some RPGs when I get home later; last year I felt like my game was the only RPG.
 Eggmaster#9544: I only meant to make a platformer but it turned out to be some kind of rage game
 Relis#1309: ah yes i know, that's what i plan on doing! but i wish i could have added a couple more levels for the jam
 Vubobinali#0059: h
 theChief#0001: > _"I have no idea what's going on"_
- most people who have played my game 😂
 Ber#3410: you can still update when the jam is over it just wouldnt be apart of the jam anymore i think
 Relis#1309: i wish i could have added more levels, it's quite short, but i had fun trying it and seeing a couple of friends trying it, so i'm happy nonetheless
 Eggmaster#9544: Enjoy
 Michel#2879: jam submission. Because it asks the op in return if he want to try your game
 zeidXD#0210: alright , im downloading it
 Ber#3410: ehh idk mine is good and bad mainly bad from my view
 theChief#0001: Jam submission page, it'll link your entry below it ☺️
 coolhotdogguy#4788: Is it better to comment on the game page or the jam submission page?
 Maurum#2530: got thanks yall!
 Ber#3410: i wish itch said when somebody gave your game a rating
 EGJ MooringtonYT#6759: It's really sad and crazy how many submits are just random files of the builds
 Ian Mykl#4218: couldn't be happier!
I always bite off more than I can chew for jams but despite starting with too big of a scope I somehow managed to pull it off. There are dozens of things I still want to add/change but I'm more than glad I was able to put together what I did
 Scolon#4218: comment, play, rate, make sure your page has a cover image and short description, have 3-5 images, and be patient
 Ell#3559: i have never seen a person describe reviews as being "like crack" but... kinda accurate
 FryDev#0372: also, make an appealing thumbnail and itch page
 unityAccount#7810: Be patient? Most of people might be tired from the jam
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: I don't like fishing, especially now, but a rate isn't bad...
 theChief#0001: It has only been a couple of hours, be patient. There are over 6000 other games!
 Viciouz6#4491: goddamn these reviews are like crack for me, lets trade
 Maurum#2530: Anyone know why my game isnt getting any ratings? do I need to be doing anything besides rating others games?
 Falcon#3043: dude thats accually huge for me i had nothing
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: what is your game and i will rate it
 SlingingPlant145#5532: Was anyone else's project exactly 1GB?
 Tom_Paul#4207: We managed to publish our files without the exe, I'm livid
 FryDev#0372: maybe I could expand the idea into a, you know, playable game
 theChief#0001: Very mixed 😂 I love the concept and the art style, absolutely gutted that I didn't have time to make it fun - it's pretty boring and meaningless atm
 qxt2019#6669: Thank you
 GuyWithTime#7852: Dude I cant stop playing these games
 Hippo#6071: You can take the things you've learned with you for next time!
 goSciu#6587: I think I'm gonna do a self jam over this week with the theme you guys had. I feel like I have some cool ideas.
 Wenlong#7472: There's a count on the upper right corner of your submissions page
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: Guy please rate my game 
 wumpus#3512: you can change everything except the actual game files - but the itch page is changeable
 Ell#3559: we did what we could in the timeframe, so i'm happy :)
 snuffysam#2767: I have 8 ratings and 2 commenters (one commented twice so 3 comments total lol)
Really nice to have 2 hours after ratings opened
 FryDev#0372: I was not able to finish my game whatsoever, and while I am disappointed I was not able to make a playable game, I’m slightly glad that I at least tried
 Falcon#3043: can one add screenshots this late?
 qxt2019#6669: Where can i see my votes?
 Cyndaquil#2646: Gg
 Scolon#4218: So how do you guys feel about your finished products
Well, jam versions atleast
 goSciu#6587: I wish I could have taken part this year, but I had a meetup with friends this Saturday
Well, there's always next year
 BluEagle#4805: i have no idea but, you cannot even imagine the joy when i saw 4 reviews
 dhafo#4640: still, even with the downsides now i'm def gonna use yarn spinner again, pretty sweet solution for easy dialogue lol not sponsored i swear
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: I have to say:
it was hard, but I finally regained my lost passion for gamedev. finally it's time to utilise a game idea I have 3 months now... tomorrow because it's 12:41 
 Wenlong#7472: I got 3 votes and 0 comments... It seems people don't have much to say about it
 snuffysam#2767: Originates from Passion Orange Guava juice oddly enough. Just in a weird turn of events
 qxt2019#6669: My game was played by 21 people but has 0 reviews thats a new record
 wumpus#3512: i didnt do this, just came up with this idea now - but would it be possible to make a game that pulls its textures and code from an API, if you changed that would it technically count as updating?
 Valkyrrii#3264: somebody downloaded my awful 2021 game. I'm so sorry, whoever you were.
 birdstone#3073: hello
 dhafo#4640: i took the "risk" of trying it out for the first time in the jam lol
 Falcon#3043: Pog
A word used to indicate excitement or an epic moment. Comes from Pogchamp.-urban dictionary
 FryDev#0372: next time I should probably join a team
 snuffysam#2767: I had an issue with that too, fortunately I realized the bug with the standard assets before the jam started
 King Sol#2650: How you get 4 already? 😮
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: oh dialogue
it was hard making a crappy one
 Äml#2258: I could… but they are probably active in other activities (not all of them are real game developers, so they’ll be working on other stuff)
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: yeah, it's good to have found a way to go about things personally still!
 dhafo#4640: one of the assets i used broke my webgl build i think but it made dialogue super easy
 Lunar#4998: well a comment is a comment after all, so congrats!!
 qxt2019#6669: Could be difrent for everybody i like to have a idea first then the art
 ledfloyd85#0865: People are probably voting 5 stars for the meme
 Scolon#4218: Also, don't worry about some games getting tons of ratings early, that's usually because the creators are already known somewhat or said people are just sharing their game more
As long as you play, rate, and comment, the itch.io algorithms will take care of the rest
 BluEagle#4805: i am really happy with this gamejam
I may have not made that great of a prototype but at least i can say with confidence 4 people played and reviewed my game
And now i am left with a really good game idea that i continue working on
It really has pushed me to being maybe a little less lazy and stuck on details
 King Sol#2650: Why can't you continue working with them on future projects?
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: I got a comment!
in the project not the jam
it's the same after all
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: no, we're post jam deadline on the last day of the jam. It was 2 minutes a few hours ago
 snuffysam#2767: I leaned heavily on the standard assets and I think it helped my game? In previous jams I had trouble with like, getting basic physics feeling good
 Äml#2258: best thing I learned in this jam is how to work with other people and especially how much fun it is. I already miss my team
 JuliusCube#8501: im not a mod but it does seem like too much
 swarm#1128: My linux build got a download before the windows build! hi to the linux using stranger
 shim#5566: What does pog mean lol
 unityAccount#7810: Isn't the cooldown a bit high?
 sbubby#4885: i somehow like starting from the art, makes the prototypes feel so much better
it doesn't have to be the final art either, but getting a pleasant-looking prototype set goes a long way
 Falcon#3043: pog
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: oh
crap
I learned something today hehe!
 Hippo#6071: Or make the default project but it crashes 9 times out of 10 on the roll of a dice.
 unityAccount#7810: I made all mechanics separately but had no time to bring it all together
 Valkyrrii#3264: I _should_ have done that but I spent a solid 5 hours early figuring out the math of the perspective style I was using.
If anyone tells you to make a accurate perspective overhead game, tell them no. it hurts.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i mean it's more complicated than that. starting from assets can be a good inspiration point. after i drew my dice sprites i got the idea of dice dropping from enemies in a shmup. can be different for everyone. but i guess you did say major
 snuffysam#2767: Yes, itch scales your score by number of votes. IDK the exact algorithm but basically, if a game has one vote total that’s 5 stars in everything, that won’t automatically make it the highest game
 swarm#1128: crap, why did i have to spend time at all on this
 Hippo#6071: Damn I spent so much time making a game when I could have just done this.
 Falcon#3043: well i guess i skipped the art completely
 Scolon#4218: That's what I did, I used temporary sprites for the the entirety of the first day
 BrainCanibala#8362: 🤓 (Nerd emoji)
 qxt2019#6669: I learned that you should make the core gameplay loop first befor making art and useless features
 AlpalcaLad#2549: its gonna happen
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i hope someone just published the default unity or godot project and somehow it gets a perfect 5 star over all rating with 10k ratings.
 Falcon#3043: the amount of votes is important?
 Scolon#4218: I'm going to play a few more games then I'll take a break. I have some work to take care of
 BluEagle#4805: good enough, was curious
 snuffysam#2767: Yes, the three main scores get combined into an overall score, and then the highest overall scores get judged by mark
 Woomek#4366: True, I am actually learning for a job as game designer. Game Jams like this are a practise tool for me so i really like to get feedback. and honest feedback, not only 'fun game'
 Eggmaster#9544: That's me, I just assume most people don't hate it as much as I do.
 Falcon#3043: after the voting ends
 BluEagle#4805: is there anywhere where you can see which place your game is at?
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: people who hate their game but are also sad that it doesn't have many rates are weird.....
 Woomek#4366: Will there be an overall rating at the end of rating game period?
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: yes!
 BluEagle#4805: quick question: are we allowed to post our game page's link into  again after the 6 hours cooldown?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: no i mean. instead of reacting you Can just use emojis. like i'm with you on letting people use reactions being a bad thing. plus i'm p sure you can only use emojis from here anyways
 unityAccount#7810: Hey, does anyone know what happened to that 20+ member team?
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: shhhh!!!! What if the mods close emojis?
 ryan123#4605: where they bot reviews?
 Wenlong#7472: It was webgl
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: yeah but this is easier to police
 qxt2019#6669: You guys get ratings ?
 wumpus#3512: only got 1 rating and 12 plays lmao
 ryan123#4605: maybe desktop downloads
 theChief#0001: People suck, unfortunately! Especially in large servers like this xD
 Wenlong#7472: Yo why do I have more ratings than browser plays? Happens to me every jam 🙃
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: we've got no real way to stop people just putting swastikas everywhere or whatever except disabling reacts/emotes
 EnergyDashClarko#4158: Sad times.... Roger, so no emotions then 😦
 Uthel#6594: 48 hours is pretty short, I witnessed a half dozen or so projects, just in my circle of friends who entered, who did not complete - scope creep is a killer
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: People can spam the chat with offensive emotes from other channels
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: people with nitro can react to things with emojis depicting hate symbols or they could just react to something with a thousand reacts to be annoying
 Hippo#6071: I think knowing how much scope you can handle in a certain amount of time is one of the best skills that game jams teach.
 EnergyDashClarko#4158: Spam with emotions? Always thought you can only spam with actual text, and emoji are only for reactions... ?
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: agree
 qxt2019#6669: Great
 Michel#2879: agrees
 Hippo#6071: I guess you could make a smaller game next time if you only have one day?
 theChief#0001: To stop spam
 EnergyDashClarko#4158: why emotions turned off, this is just wrong!   😦
 theChief#0001: You can update the game after the rating period!
 qxt2019#6669: I just didnt have enough time i started a day too late
 happynessisgames#3531: aight people, dm me your games and I'll play it, at the cost of you having to play my game
 theChief#0001: Once the rating period is over, it'll all be unlocked ☺️ check the itch countdown to see how long you've got left!
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: 2nd and last re-send for people who did not see this
***negative thoughts can become positive!!!!***
like:
**my game isn't good** -> *but you got experience for making a better one next time*
**I didn't have any good ideas**-> *ideas become from anything. next time, even if you try right now, you can find an awesome idea!!!!*
**did I lost my time?**->*you gotta be kidding now. NO!!!!*
 sbubby#4885: not after the deadline
 nizbel#9979: Take notes on what you got right
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i just thought what would be the least likely thing you could see dice in. Shmup was it to me. and also i was really interested on how you could add die to a shmup
 Michel#2879: it's summer holiday for me
 Hippo#6071: Update the game after the jam or take the lessons you've learned for the next game you make.
 Scolon#4218: It's useful for self-improvement. You can improve with future projects
 EnergyDashClarko#4158: 🤔
 Cyklon_3000#6139: I understand it right, that its allowed to add a Web Version of the Program? (afterwards)
 Tob#1798: ok thanks
 Wompfbeere#0090: do they get reenabled afterwards?
i need to apply some patches for bugs i found already 😅
 qxt2019#6669: Quick question. What am i supposed to do with constructive comments if i cant update the game
 Uthel#6594: Brainstorming ideas was a non-issue for me this time - five minutes after the theme "Hmm how about golf but the ball is a die and the roll result dictates the power of your next shot" - about 30 seconds of hmming and hawing, then full commit, make golf
 sbubby#4885: this game jam i've learned that making turn strategy games is
1) simpler than i thought
2) still way too difficult
 theChief#0001: Wait til mark makes them public with his video. Probably 2-3 weeks away
 Falcon#3043: +1
 wumpus#3512: Im proud of the fact that i cant see that anybody else doing my idea
 theChief#0001: Uploads are locked til the end of the rating period!
 Tob#1798: how to see ratings?
 Scolon#4218: Also I noticed there are a lot of implementations of "roll dice on a grid and get to end point" type puzzle games
I guess that was the most common interpretation this time around
 Relis#1309: yeah i plan on reviewing a lot of games tomorrow, but i'm just too tired at the moment
 EW#3256: dudes gotta sleep 🛏️
 Flafy#4391: oof I can't add a linux version for my game
 Hippo#6071: Give it some time, a lot of people are recovering from the creation and submission process right now.
 gamedevperson#8448: i have nothing to do, dm me your game and i might play it
 theChief#0001: It has not been very long 😂 most people will have crashed and will be sleeping. Many more will be rating other games. Be patient!
 Scolon#4218: It takes time, last time I was in a gmtk game jam I ended up waking up to a lot of notifications
 Syton#9947: I do, but, it doesnt seem to me that many player noticed my game..
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: me:opens discord light mode
 EW#3256: a thousand steps begins at the first step
 theChief#0001: Please keep jam links to 
 theChief#0001: I usually go for one "something new" and one "system that I can reuse in another project"
This time it was animation rigging for my worm enemy, and a big powerup system that I think I might package up and sell on the asset store because it's so damn good 😂
 gamedevperson#8448: and one thats okay in quality is a bigger milestone
 Scolon#4218: Play, rate, and leave constructive comments on as many games as you can if you want your game to get noticed
 Hippo#6071: My game has a die but technically no dice.
 EW#3256: getting a game finished  is already a big milestone
 Syton#9947: Hey everyone
Kinda hard to get your game noticed, so if anyone is interested in checking my game and i will check his let me know by sending a message 🙂
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: yes! That's why I sent this message
 Uthel#6594: someone stole my weekend!
 Lex#2782: If anyone wants me to play their game send it to my dms :)
 hamboy#0394: 48 hours felt like 2
 sbubby#4885: still feel like i lost my time but it's the post-jam nerves speaking, stress messes you up
 Gumy#7061: Your game doesn’t have to have dice IN them… I don’t think he meant dice literally… themes are always up to interpretation
 Bradley#8324: Getting your submission in at all for these things is impressive as far Im concerned. Shipping anything’s the hardest part
 shim#5566: I always try to learn 1-2 new techniques each jam so that no matter what happens there's progress. This jam was somewhat of a train wreck but I got some experience with FMod which was cool
 EW#3256: its all about perspectives
 hamboy#0394: Heh
 snuffysam#2767: Chop, slice, etc
 Uthel#6594: Same. I sometimes go out of my way to screw him over. Self-trolling?
 Jhunter#4054: Oh really I didn’t know that
 voltingshock#2237: You can. I did not submit a game and I am rating them right now
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: ***negative thoughts can become positive!!!!***
like:
**my game isn't good** -> *but you got experience for making a better one next time*
**I didn't have any good ideas**-> *ideas become from anything. next time, even if you try right now, you can find an awesome idea!!!!*
**did I lost my time?**->*you gotta be kidding now. NO!!!!*
 Relis#1309: future me? i hate that guy
 BassWasTaken#7424: As long as you do your best and you communicate beforehand about expectations and show them your works, you should be fine
 Shimp#0064: Next jam i really should learn to work in team.
 theChief#0001: Just team lead and have other people ruin _your_ work 
 Wokarol#0940: Elaborate, what you mean as a "verb" here in this context?
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: I can already tell feedback this year will be a little more frustrating than usual because people think the game is unfinished whereas i think it just subverts expectations
 Uthel#6594: its way more fun and less stressful being solo. I just let the spaghetti fly, turning it into a scalable system is a problem for future me, if it even needs to happen 😛
 coolhotdogguy#4788: A few jams ago I tried finding a team. I had three separate artists all agree to make something and ended up doing nothing XD
 Relis#1309: ahah same that's why i went solo
 Wokarol#0940: Well, that's part of the process. After my last year's jam game I got like... plenty of feedback that there is no audio, every other comment.
That's just life
 Shimp#0064: Same, but im too scared to ruin someone's work xd
 gamedevperson#8448: same
 hamboy#0394: I wanna work with a team next jam
 Hippo#6071: It's a good idea to look at other comments when reviewing so you don't tell someone something they've heard 10 times already.
 NascentSpace#8115: I bet there’s at least one person who forgot to add a dice to the game until the last hour
 coolhotdogguy#4788: That's what I try to do. At least one thing I like that works well and one thing I think could help make the game better
 Uthel#6594: My first game jam is the biggest jam ever 😛 pretty proud of the end result too, used a whole bunch of my new game dev tricks ive been polishing - could have done more, could always do more
 theChief#0001: There's a lot of stuff you _can_ give feedback on though, it's still useful to validate a concept! Even if the answer is just "yeah I know, didn't have time", it can be useful for the dev to know what to focus on
 Bradley#8324: We used “dice” as a verb
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: i feel that. you can always try to complement something they did in a creative way, and highlight how it could be improved even more
 Jasper#7906: Hehe, I can get behind that. I did a lot of testing with modified builds that had enemies with low health to let me get to specific parts quickly, especially when it comes to the huge addition of abilities and upgrades I added in the last two hours. So, I haven't really tried to get far during the jam
 Wokarol#0940: Scrolling through twitter during the jam... oh boi, some of those really have dice tacked on after the gameplay was designed
 Michel#2879: I once trolled someone by acting that I thought lmao meant London's maintainable agricultural origins and he actually wasted 15 minutes convincing me it meant laughed my a.. off
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: i always feel really awkward giving jam feedback, it feels like 99% of the time the response to 'i don't like x' would be 'yeah i know it's bad i just didn't have time to fix it'
 hamboy#0394: More competition
 Scolon#4218: We break records every year
 Hippo#6071: Oh looks like there ended up being a record number of entries again?
 MikeHazeJr#6582: Lmao this 1000x
 NascentSpace#8115: Mark trying to singlehandedly destroy itch’s servers
 Bradley#8324: Man, just catching up on the discord. That was a ton of fun.
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: my least favourite thing about jams is being reminded over and over about one obvious thing you need to change, all while not being able to change it anymore
 nicholas#8278: it's 10 games you have to go through before you get to choose
 Scolon#4218: There dice, dice EVERYWHERE
 theChief#0001: Yes, but they have to go through an amount of random games before they get to choose which to rate
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: entirely convinced that this game jam is not a game jam and just an annual ritual mark does to punish itch.io for some reason
 Michel#2879: r.p.g as in ||rough penis game||
 theChief#0001: It sounds like you didn't add the project to the jam with the "submit your project" button. If you created your project from that link, itch __does not automatically link it to the jam__ - it sucks I know, but you know for next time! You can still upload and post your link around and get some feedback ☺️ it's not completely wasted time!
 seshoumara#4386: can other people not in the jam rate games?
 NascentSpace#8115: I wonder how few games won’t have dice in them
 Wokarol#0940: I did it few minutes ago. I think Itch is recovering from the annual crash
 Uthel#6594: much of my development time was consumed with "testing", defo just playin game 😛
 NalaFala38290#9305: same
 dhafo#4640: sadly this time i made a puzzle game so i know all the paths by heart 😭
 thatsmaik#6513: Ok thanks everyone! And congrats! 🙂
 King Sol#2650: Oh my cover photo is on now!
 snuffysam#2767: RPGs have randomness 🤷‍♀️
 Jasper#7906: I'm actually enjoying my own game enough to still be playing it after the jam 😄
 voltingshock#2237: DM me the name. I'm going thhru all the 0 ratings rn
 theChief#0001: Itch is struggling at the minute, it'll work eventually!
 Hippo#6071: Theme was great for RPGs this year. I made one too. xD
 Jhunter#4054: Yeah should be able to. I did
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: the life of someone with 0 ratings and a game uploaded 4 hours ago and 515 impressions..... -n-
 dhafo#4640: i prob should have but i havent slept yet lol
 thatsmaik#6513: Is it possible to change the jam thumbnail picture afterwards? Doesn't seem like it
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: I'm noticing a lot of RPGs, anyone else seeing this?
 seshoumara#4386: I wanted to add more levels to my Sokoban-like game, and sounds, and mechanics ... I'm just glad I submitted it in time as my first jam 😄
 KaiDeleon#3092: We uploaded multiple build well in advance of the deadline so that kinda sucks. I won't keep badgering about it, just really frustrated that all the work our team put in won't be part of the competition. We are happy to wait until the event is over and try to upload later just for funsies.
 Michel#2879: it was directly before your comment. That's why I thought u saw mine
 theChief#0001: You'll get a final score once mark makes it public
 snuffysam#2767: Donald Glover Good Dot Gif
 Scolon#4218: Yeah ratings are hidden
 theChief#0001: Correct
 dhafo#4640: tbh i missed that comment in the flood lol i just saw the unrated link and clicked
 theChief#0001: Wait til the mark makes the ratings public with his video, probably 2-3 weeks away but don't hold me to that 😂
 FloFlo#6826: Someone rated my game but i cant see what the rating is (Mice of the Dice)
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: those are hidden until the end of the review period
 Shimp#0064: Guys, how to see the stars part of the reviews?
 Michel#2879: you can't see your own game on unrated list. What I said was a joke actually
 NuclearEmerald Gaming#6629: I didn't manage to finish my game in time but I got farther making it than I have any other game I've tried to make in the past so I'm pretty happy with it
 Gui77302011#2574: OK, thanks for confirming. I'm sorry. It was my first game makers try and I did not realize I needed the .pck. I'll be back next time!
 theChief#0001: You can update the page, you can't upload any new versions
 LOPSTERu#3902: it's okay to change your description during the voting period, right?
 Michel#2879: yeah i can post there in 2 minutes
 Aeph#4622: really happy with my submission, given this is the first time I've participated in one of these. thank you to the team at GMTK for a great jam and looking forward to next year!
 shim#5566: How does the submission limit work anyways? Are you still allowed to upload new versions after submission if your first submission was on time? How about updating the game page like background graphics, colors, descriptions?
 NalaFala38290#9305: I think you can't see your own game on the unrated list
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: feel free to post when the cooldown is up! it's 6 hours so it'll be hard to spam
 theChief#0001: Uploads are locked, we can't make exceptions. Sorry!
 dhafo#4640: are the ratings glitched? mine says 0 ratings but doesnt appear on unrated list lol
 Michel#2879: is it ok to post twice there or that is considered promotion?
 Relis#1309: ah thanks man but i don't like begging for it ^^ i mean i really appreciate it but it's scummy to fish for ratings like that
 theChief#0001: No, that's the total ratings for the jam 😂
 Gui77302011#2574: Hi, I just realized I uploaded my .exe file, but I need to upload a .pck file for the game to work. Would I be allowed to upload the .pck?
 Wokarol#0940: How the f..... I think the ` k ` is missplaced
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: your itch name/team name?
 AzCraft#4405: Still some unrated games:
 Uthel#6594: there was a couple of other weird ones, one of my music tracks was.. 10% volume in webgl, while volume was maxed for it, all other audio was normal, no idea what the cause was, I ended up bringing the track into amplify and crrranking it to an unlistenable level, and magically hit the sweet spot where it sounds normal in webgl
 theChief#0001: Please keep jam links to 
 Relis#1309: yeah, not a big deal. I had fun making it so i don't raelly care
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: last time around it was around 144k ratings. we're already getting around 1/10th of the ratings last time
 dhafo#4640: i decided to try yarn spinner this jam without knowing how it works so gg to web build it bugged out lolol
 ふわ#7070: i have 0
 Michel#2879: I went to rate games in need for rate. I realised my game was the one in need for rate
 theChief#0001: If it's not part of the jam now, there's nothing we can do. Sorry!
 KaiDeleon#3092: I understand, my team submitted before the deadline and are not sure what happened. Our game appeared on the website for a brief time and now it is not so we aren't sure what happened
 King Sol#2650: I really needed this, lol feels bad uploading non WebGL build
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: no, i mean. the... jam's total number of ratings? as in the whole game jam
 dhafo#4640: 😭 i would be in trouble if someone streamed mine lmao
 Relis#1309: i'd be happy to get one 😂
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Keep reviews/promotions to  please!
 Michel#2879: are people really getting 12k ratings?
 HappyBabushka#3296: you got 1!
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: 20.5k rates?
best game: 158 people rated this
my game: rated by 1 people
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: if only I still used Unity...
 Syafire#3333: I will be streaming Games tomorrow so if yall want ur game streamed and reviewed live make sure ya stop by ^_^
 aflyingpotato#7521: So far I've gotten a lot fewer reviews in the first couple hours compared to last year. Not sure why... maybe everyone's burnt out from itch crashing
 dhafo#4640: i really wanna see my ratings after it's over, the game i made is way diff from my usual arcade jam game i wonder if people are gonna not like it
 Uthel#6594: neat, I use the.. non-better one 😛 my problems this time were just the usual stuff I always forget about - turning off data caching, removing async scene loading
 Scolon#4218: 💀
 theChief#0001: The jam is over, submissions are locked. Unfortunately we can't make exceptions, sorry!
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: Is it bad that I've already rated this game, but I'm still sat here playing it?
 Zyjin#8552: Ohhh, I wasn't aware of LFS I did some googling though and it sounds useful, because once we added in audio/video it did take awhile to pull/push sometimes haha
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: I wanted to stop 2 hours before and I had streeeeeeeeeeeeess
the thing is that after that instead of fixing bugs I was chatting here and...
my GaMe SuuCks
not sucks exactly
but it isn't for the top 100 100%
if my game get's to top 1.000 I will be ultra happy, it will be like a win for me
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: awesome, i'll try it out soon!
 SkyanSam#7970: *makes a model to predict the amount of signups for the gmtk jam each year*
 Valkyrrii#3264: I was hoping to make top 20% but given how good these games are, just hoping for top 50% now :p
 KaiDeleon#3092: My team is still having trouble from the server issues earlier and it says we did not submit anything, is there a better channel I should post in to get some help? 😦
 Syafire#3333: omg haha Well good work x,D U did it 😄
 SaadTheGlad#9716: It keeps increasing every year!
 coolhotdogguy#4788: Aye good advice. True too! I've played and rated every game from the comments I've received.
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: One nice thing I do with git is make use of LFS, keeps Github from complaining
 dhafo#4640: imma rate a bunch tomorrow but man i'm worn out lol
 theChief#0001: 5,700ish
 Michel#2879: bro is that even possible
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: hey chief, did you partecipate this time around? i wanna try out your game!
 CyborgCabbage#8716: how many sign-ups was there last year?
 Jhunter#4054: whaaat how are you alive
 theChief#0001: Best way to get more is to play, rate and comment on other games! The better the comment, the more likely someone is to do the same for you 😁
 Uthel#6594: I tend to be more productive when I do everything in one sitting.. 41 hours might have been a little much though, was getting really fuzzy when time came to troubleshoot the webgl build 😛
 Santia#2861: This a 100% agreed
 SaadTheGlad#9716: Yep, latest jams I was sort of just the artist for but this one I had to direct most of everything which was so stressful
 coolhotdogguy#4788: I hoping this year for a decent sample size of reviews of my game. It is so much fun to get feedback and reactions
 Zyjin#8552: Hmm, gotcha, I'll check it out when I get a chance, because I think that would be much nicer, I was just much more familiar with git so I just went for it haha
 dhafo#4640: idk how people are already rating lol
 Michel#2879: general.slowMode = false;
 dark prince of kisses#3874: I'm gonna take what I had and keep working it out into a finished proto, it had enough legs
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: already 12k ratings... just a few minutes ago it was 10k...
 shim#5566: It's easier when you join someone else's jam then watch them flourish or flounder 🙂 I organized the last game jam I was on and it was successful, but stressful
 SkyanSam#7970: Actually there was some *web version breaking*, but it wasn't related to the Unity Animator bug. WebGL was breaking because of Brotli so I just disabled compression and now it works
 Syafire#3333: omg haha I did that my frist jam but then I realized the value of sleep haha xD
 SaadTheGlad#9716: I've had more stress in this jam than in finals wtf
 MrBen#0001: cool 👍
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: I thought plastic had a free tier? It's built-in to Unity, so it's what I'd recommend
 Michel#2879: lol. choose your teammates wisely next time
 dark prince of kisses#3874: alas, wasn't able to get even close to finishing my design. but I learned plenty, so I'm happy enough
 kintrix#6819: Oh, so just the usual *web version breaking?*
 Santia#2861: I FEEL THAT SO MUCH
I had to google so much UE5 shit because they casually changed the entire Light Rendering engine that is way too realistic for comfort, we were fixing super weird RNG calculation bugs, it was a wild ride lol
 Zyjin#8552: Yeah, I saw Unity owns plastic, but unfortunately have to pay I believe correct?
I'm not super familiar with what would be easily available for source control maybe for next time, any other suggestions? 
 Uthel#6594: Good good, I went hard and grinded 41 hours straight, submitted, then slept for the rest 😛
 MrBen#0001: oh yes
 USER#8646: i got one comment, wasn't expecting any so im happy
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: I had a ton of getting burned out in my room with the door closed for 2 days to make pretty much something that kiiiiiiiiiiiiinda sucks. I'm happy for it but I could have made something simpler
 Michel#2879: same
 SkyanSam#7970: That is what I did, but another teammate used Unity Animator and there was a bug related to the Animator parameters, so I spent the last few minutes of the jam fixing the bug xDDD The Windows version doesn't have the bug but the WebGL version does
 nicholas#8278: lol
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: well, good jam all, time to go watch task master!
 Syafire#3333: Congrats ❤️ how are you feelin?
 kintrix#6819: Or make your own Engine, Skyan
 Zyjin#8552: Bro, I was literally in charge of planning just sitting there like, *googles furiously how to plan a game development what the hell*
And yeah we have NO COLLISION ON OUR WALLS WITH THE PLAYER AND WE SPENT 2 DAYS WITH NO IDEA WHY LOL
 Michel#2879: just make you own. Array of sprites and a small script
 Uthel#6594: was my first jam, I had a ton of fun 😄
 theChief#0001: All of the public channels close. There are private channels for patreons, though!
 pibolib#2222: take a look at itch.io
there's jams running basically all the time
maybe a couple per month that are about this short
 Viciouz6#4491: Havent tried on mobile, let me check first 🙂 It bugs out when running on full screen for some reason
 JJfriends#3686: YouTube
 coolhotdogguy#4788: Anyone else been getting some real good feedback already?
 [Error_27]#3011: same
 trick0#7801: it's ok to post here the game we made for the jam?
 Fluorescent#6450: same
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: oof my game kinda sucks
 Syafire#3333: Hope everyone had an amazing Jam!
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: lol
 shim#5566: Since this game jam only happens once per yer, does this Discord basically go dormant? I'm a Unity programmer looking to do more game jams.
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: yeah, this is why git isn't ideal for Unity. Other source controls that have the ability to lock files are better with game engines, like Plastic... oh wait, Unity owns plastic
 Michel#2879: if its a webgl that works on mobile, dm me, I am no longer using my pc after fucking the CPU up due to 20 continuos hours of a 3d game engine running
 SkyanSam#7970: This jam was fun but it has further increased my hate for the Unity Animator system
 Santia#2861: I can imagine, but ay pulled it off, that's what matters. We literally fixed gamebreaking bugs 30mins before submission MonkaW
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: nice! it's good to see everyone rating stuff, seeing the feedback on this stuff is going to be great
 Pixelan#2176: I know that feeling. Game jams are awesome. Congrats on publishing a game!
 Syafire#3333: 😊
 Zyjin#8552: BRO, Unity was EVIL if anyone tried to edit the same scene in different commits and then merge into master, it caused all kinds of bizzare errors
 King Sol#2650: I'm just so glad I took part. I've been playing with unity for years falling victim to scope creep and never publishing anything. It was really nice to have a deadline to actually force me to publish.
 USER#8646: wish there were more gmtk game jams in a year, but then they wouldnt be as poppular
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: good luck, I have tons of public games
 coolhotdogguy#4788: Anyone else make an endless scroller?
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: I rated 7
 Viciouz6#4491: Not sure how to feel about my game... I think its one of my best jam games I have ever done, but it lacks the simplicity I always went for my previous games. Didn't think it would be so complicated (based on the reviews so far). Anyone who can do a honest review? I'll do yours as well
 Santia#2861: Same with UE5
One of our devs literally had to make an empty file to fix an arbitrary merge error lmaoooo
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: alright, rated 10 games so far, i'll try to do 20 daily for the rest of the week
 SkyanSam#7970: someone could find your game by searching up your username on itch
 Zyjin#8552: Thanks! You too dude, we all learned a ton of the fly, which is really the main idea of this.
PS: Git + Unity = Holy hell some weird errors
 Scolon#4218: Have we rated every game now?
 Sub  Zero#0830: Yeah
 BestW#8170: Would someone be willing to play my submission? Just to test
 JuliusCube#8501: does that mean "its good" or "its horrible"
 sbubby#4885: i dislike our game but everyone knows the best part of the jam is playing other people's games
 GuyWithTime#7852: Sorry I cant hear you
 Kyo Ricardo#4586: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 Tom#1701: Cheers!
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: I mean the game was terrible, but that was cause I didn't have any ideas. No I won't be sending it to anyone, if you want it, track it down by playing the other 6000 games
 Teslobo#8274: what was that? 🔥
 Santia#2861: Same in a Team of 4, especially because us setting up github incorrectly screwed us over constantly lmaooo
Congrats to your team!
 JuliusCube#8501: No, thank YOU for hosting it.
 EW#3256: 🙇
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: (do not do this)
 USER#8646: it was my first one loved the procces so much , also please can we reduce the slowmode
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: right let's burn this motherfucker down
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: shit mark's gone
 BestW#8170: Ah man, i submitted a previous jam , and people think it's the actual game i made lol.
 MikeHazeJr#6582: Lmao yes that is why I submitted before bed last night. I intended to wake up and patch the remaining issues and finish the game loop, but was too exhausted. Will update game once rating concludes.
 Zyjin#8552: First time for me and my team, and we had like 5 people on and off, and even with 48 hrs we struggled since we were all mostly new
 Mark Brown#6982: Right, I’m going to head off!
I just wanted to say a humongous thank you to everyone for taking part in the GMTK Game Jam for 2022. It’s now the biggest game jam in Itch.io’s history, with over 22,000 sign-ups and 6,000 games.
It is not taken for granted that thousands of people excitedly spend their entire weekend making games at the behest of some random British guy on YouTube. It’s a wonderfully cool part of GMTK and I’m excited for it to continue!
I hope you all had a really fun time! Maybe made something awesome, or learned something new, or found someone cool to work with. Take a break, take a breath, and then play some of these amazing-looking games from the community. Ratings are great, constructive comments are even better.
Cheers!

 L0rd#5654: send me the game
 EW#3256: make your own engine jam any%
 Santia#2861: goddamn now that's a flex
 USER#8646: you really did lol? howd it go
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: damn 0_o
 Penguinmanereikel#3708: Honestly, that’s the best feeling.
 Sub  Zero#0830: It's good to publish your game early lol
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: Anyone else here make a game without using an engine?
 coolhotdogguy#4788: Oh good idea, I'll add my discord to my game page
 L0rd#5654: this jam was a disaster
 Santia#2861: I did hobby stuff in UE4 and my friends and I had to learn everything different in UE5 in those 48h too lmaoooo
 voltingshock#2237: I wish I could find some of these creators on discord to compliment them
 MikeHazeJr#6582: It did, and submissions were closed a few minutes later
 USER#8646: actually finishing a game was so fun i wanna make another one already
 Scolon#4218: Yes
 Zyjin#8552: Ain't that the truth
 Sub  Zero#0830: Did the Itch opened?
 Santia#2861: Creating anything in 48h is quite an achievement. The Time limit is a whole different level
 basake#4465: Yea I basically slept like 8 hrs in total
 Penguinmanereikel#3708: I guess I got reason to be proud. This the first game I’ve submitted to itch and the first game I made for a jam. DM me your game. We can review each other’s games
 NalaFala38290#9305: unlikely
 Shimp#0064: You haven't seen my main menu guys, i abused that Arial font for sure xd
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: form what? the amount of stress we had to go through to finish lol?
 Falcon#3043: is it possible to get 0 ratings throughout the whole rating time?
 Jhunter#4054: Relatable. I always save main menu for last and it’s always so bad
 basake#4465: Shouldnt everyone be dead by now 😂
 coolhotdogguy#4788: Has anyone played or made any endless scrollers? I wanna know how many of us there are!
 anticarasosman#2765: many thanks
 MaryStrawberry#4672: ah alright!
 Arjen#7950: thanks for hosting again this year Mark
I'm spent this weekend but it's always good fun
 USER#8646: my start screen is litreally 28 sprites and 8 labels under a single node
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: In previous years Mark has had a submission form for people to submit their own games to be played on stream - zero overlap with the top 100 games
 EW#3256: almost forgot to submit it but forunately i rmbed to do so at near 1 minute left
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: its the afternoon for me lol
 JuliusCube#8501: the exact game idea is that you are a die and the amount of spaces that you roll each turn is dictated by the number on the top of the die. its a little finicky and a bit confusing imo but its an idea and its not bad
 Mark Brown#6982: Yep, we tried to make it super clear! (I made the text red this year - I'll do it bold as well in 2023 :P) But glad you had fun nonetheless and got to make a game you're, hopefully, proud of!
 katiepotatoes#1609: can you see what someone rated your game?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: the jam just hit 10k ratings!
 Penguinmanereikel#3708: Fair enough. Hadn’t considered the multiple computers being on.
 Kyo Ricardo#4586: well you could take that as great minds think alike
 MaryStrawberry#4672: streamed games != top 100 that eventually get chosen as the best right?
 basake#4465: How is everyone still awake now
 Gui77302011#2574: I forgot to upload my pck file to itch.io
 King Sol#2650: When we get 3 days of sun per year in the UK, we take advantage of them!
 USER#8646: lol my code was soooo  bad
 KadDev#8100: oof,  I should've read the instructions more carefully, I thought it was automatic after you clicked submit to jam, but I guess it's more about the journey than the destination, even if you never reached it...
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: alright, i wanna play it 🙂
 Santia#2861: same haha :D
 Scolon#4218: Yeah I've been on the randomizer for a while
 Mark Brown#6982: Yes, live streaming is a very exhausting process, and you have to be in a room with multiple computers turned on
 paulhdh#6428: i get that, but i am also really proud of my entry, because its the first time ive managed to complete a gamejam with something that looks completish haha
 voltingshock#2237: oh yeah I'm just going through trying to comment something helpful on every one
 JuliusCube#8501: shifting sum
 Penguinmanereikel#3708: No offense, Mark, but a heatwave prevents you from streaming on Twitch indoors?? Also, stay safe!
 Kyo Ricardo#4586: 👀 what was the game idea
 Shimp#0064: I thought that making dice roll literally was funny and original, turns out we all thought that way
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: whats youe game called?
 Santia#2861: We should've leaned into our dice/RNG gimmick more but ay it's still there and it works
Super happy for a first successful submission
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: oof, hope that gets better, i heard it's rough
 JuliusCube#8501: a lot of people did a very similar game idea to mine, but im hoping that mine is unique enough that people enjoy it
 Penguinmanereikel#3708: It makes me depressed, thinking “why didn’t I think of that?!”
 Mark Brown#6982: There are no details on my streaming as of yet, other than I won't be streaming monday or tuesday as it's a heatwave in the UK
 Lex#2782: If anyone wants me to play their game send it to my dms :)
 coolhotdogguy#4788: For real! I haven't played two that are similar yet.
 Santia#2861: True, I love that almost every other game title is a dice pun
 GuyWithTime#7852: I was just about to write that totally agree
 boomo#2025: any schedule?
 Kyo Ricardo#4586: on what? twitch? youtube?
 paulhdh#6428: man some of these games are soooo clever, it makes me really happy
 Mark Brown#6982: and then - crucially! - did you go back to the jam page and submit it to the jam
 PlayToTroll#4277: Yes the will
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: if I've worked this out right... 
 Mr.Boda#3589: dani maybe
 KadDev#8100: on the itch page I clicked submit to jam, and then I uploaded it to itch.io
 boomo#2025: will GMTK be streaming games this year?
 Santia#2861: check how they can be interpreted. Random elements are also "rolls of the dice"
 coolhotdogguy#4788: Does anyone know of any other streamers that will be playing games from this jam? Is there interest in this?
 Mark Brown#6982: Did you upload the game to Itch and then - crucially! - did you go back to the jam page and submit it to the jam
 Boefst#1672: Just general question for more experienced game jammers.
How do you usually rate other games that don't fit the theme?
Found some kinda cool games but they don't have a dice or roll in sight and I don't really know how to rate them.
 Mr.Boda#3589: i reviwed my game at 8:30 its impossible for any person to get into it my game will  be dead lol
 Shimp#0064: Wow, i got misinformed on the internet, how could it be!
 JJfriends#3686: Yeah
 sqrt#9237: i can make orange rhyme with banana
bornana
 KadDev#8100: well, I learnt a lot, and I guess I can say i'm a better game dev than I was when I started, but it hurts, that it didn't manage to get into submitions, especially because I don'thave an idea as to why ☹️
 rcbrgrs#5526: thank you, I'm silly  🙂
 Mark Brown#6982: Nope! Not sure where people get this from, I've never streamed the top 100!
 hzzzln#7656: Any ideas on how to promote my game to get ratings? Other than post here in the review-my-game channel
 theChief#0001: Yes, that's what the timer on the itch page is pointing to!
 Mark Brown#6982: All the details will be provided closer to the time
 Shimp#0064: Top 100
 Digitaldude555#5515: in 5 days its on the main page
 coolhotdogguy#4788: How will we submit games to played during the stream? And how are they selected?
 Jeker#3389: Even tho i didnt submit cause of time stuff the jam was a lovley expirience, thanks Mark and everyone else for hosting it
 dhafo#4640: u guys are rating already? i didnt even sleep yet 😭
 RGBCube#8833: i found a love2d web builder but audio likes to just break so yeah no web build ever (maybe, might make a boring soundless web game)
 rcbrgrs#5526: apologies if this has been asked already, but is there a set time that ratings close?
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: I think they're missing a few files for a successful game... like the assets file
 tested#4997: very true
 JuliusCube#8501: then great, those were extremely fun last year
 Mark Brown#6982: Nope, no plans to have public voice chat, sorry - it's impossible to moderate
 Mr.Boda#3589:   can u soon add a voice chat so we can stream and talk
 Prine#6562: Playing the game again now it's so bad XD
 sqrt#9237: ayooooooooo persona ?
 Mark Brown#6982: Ah, I'm sorry to hear that! Hope you enjoyed making the game nonetheless
 Mark Brown#6982: Yes - it will be announced in this Discord, you won't miss it 😄
 JuliusCube#8501: will we have the livestreams where mark plays our games this year?
 sqrt#9237: Sunday January 1, 2023 is in
168 days
 Mr.Boda#3589: am a begginer though no  1 get to know the name of my name too eview it (lolXD) i had a great exprience i leared many things and it was fun
 KadDev#8100: sigh, I just wasted my time... the submission didn't work, I was sure that it went it too
 Shadow the Dragon#6927: Been part of the Jams since 2019 and it's amazing to see how much it's blown up since then.
 Mark Brown#6982: As long as they understand they're taking a massive risk, and are gracious if they miss the deadline, then so be it!
 sqrt#9237: wow
 JuliusCube#8501: even then many people will still probably work straight up to the deadline.
 TheStealthNinja#2916: lol what
 Shimp#0064: There is dice date simulator, holy. This has to be top 100 for sure
 Reinspieler#2067: yeah
 Mark Brown#6982: #GMTKJam
 ByerN#4378: Is there a twitter tag for this gamejam?
 GigglesandGlasses#8651: Congratulations on breaking last year's entry count everyone!
 Mark Brown#6982: Very successful! Amazing numbers, can't believe we surpassed 2021. And pretty seamless. The 50 hour thing has also gone pretty well, but will need a little clearer communication next year as some people were working right up to the last second (and some missed the jam because of that)
 Mr.Boda#3589:   kind thing to communicate with us as a youtuber rarly when a youtuber talk with thier community
 Shimp#0064: I hope i get actual review of my game of whats wrong and whats good and not "bad" or "its ok" comments lol
 Kyo Ricardo#4586: true....
 Poweries#8748: its not updating, how many ratings each game has
 unityAccount#7810: How did the jam go for you Marks and mods?
 39#6748: the best way to deal with whatever the f i made
 Barsik#9758: Okay, thank you^^
 ESC#8775: Anyone named their game literally after the theme? I can't be the only one right?
 Mark Brown#6982: Itch.io is still struggling with image uploads - please be patient, and try again later!
 Kyo Ricardo#4586: time to throw away the code and then never think about it again 😎
 KadDev#8100: no... but i'm sure I submitted... I don't have the badge 😦
 Penguinmanereikel#3708: How do we see our ratings?
 USER#8646: anyone else's sad the jam is over, I loved working on my game
 Barsik#9758: the game's cover doesn't show up with the link, is there a way to fix it?
 Falcon#3043: or you can click on my submissions under haven't rated
 Hobusu#5033: If you've got the game jam badge in the top right of your game's page you're good, if not, unfortunately we're past the deadline and we can't make exceptions—you should be proud of the work you've done though!
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: you aren't looking forward to playing a few rounds of the unity crash handler?
 Wompfbeere#0090: you should have a badge on your game's page
 paulpork#7383: If anyone want to try my game, guess searching a RANDOM platformer would help lol. Anyways g'night guys
 KadDev#8100: how can I confirm that my game was actually submitted to the jam??? it doesn't seem like mine was submitted for some reason
 Indigu#6862: I don't mind going through the queue, I understand they did it for a reason so the system is more fair
 Jeker#3389: Ahhh i missed the deadline
 nicholas#8278: i found a game that was a rickroll if you lost lmao
 Kyo Ricardo#4586: are they live?
 Smaxx#4882: Oh noes 😄
 Delphine Noel#1196: Good night everyone
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: yes sorry itch were meant to be working on that after last year's jam but it hasn't been fixed
 Hobusu#5033: I'd been told that issue should be fixed, sorry if you have to go through the queue despite that!
 Santia#2861: I think our game as a first project is fire lmao
 Indigu#6862: I wasn't the exact account that submitted the game but it says that I submitted it on the itch page since we were a team, however I still have to play the random games first
 snuffysam#2767: Commenting is so important - y’all, I can’t tell who’s rated me if you don’t comment, which means I don’t know to rate you back.
And comments are just significantly more valuable than ratings… if I get a 3 average in fun, that doesn’t really tell me as much as commenters saying they were too frustrated for instance
 paulpork#7383: Alright I'm gonna sleep. It's fk 4 a.m. here and I'm exhausted
 Hobusu#5033: To be allowed to vote on whichever games they want
 Woum#5790: after they can chose which game to vote
 Acu1000#5560: how do I check my game's ratings?
 ChipmunkDev#1808: me neither
 Penguinmanereikel#3708: They have to vote on a random game first to do what?
 Digitaldude555#5515: whats this?? a rating?
 Hobusu#5033: People who didn't contribute to a game have to vote on random games first, so that may be what did it
 petipois#7030: I didn't submit in time, had fun though
 Sandroleon#7837: wrong channel sorry 😛
 JJfriends#3686: He played on stream with n8dev I'm so happy my dream is fulfilled ig time to kms ez jk
 Spaceshark YT#4155: please can anyone rate my game on mac because Unity just RANDOMLY decides to have a bug on the windows build making it unplayable
 Acu1000#5560: people are rating random games, not just the top ones
 Shimp#0064: Honestly, like the "play 10 to go to the link" system, I don't have much friends to up my rating, so i definitely would be having 0 reviews otherwise
 ShatteredReality#7834: No one has the time lol
 Penguinmanereikel#3708: Is there somebody going around and rating every game? Because someone rated my game
 USER#8646: thanks :D
 BottleFish#6146: Thanks!
 theChief#0001: Have a good cover (when itch sorts itself out)
Have a good short description
And most importantly - __play, rate and comment on a bunch of other games__! The more feedback you give, the better!
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: The server is active all year! It will close to non-patrons soon, but people who join Mark's Patreon get to hang out here all the time
 unityAccount#7810: I only had today to work and I worked like 10 hours straight, am so exhausted now
 BricksParts#5032: It's mark and all his clones. They are among us
 ESC#8775: Tmw you'e been treating this jam like Ludum Dare Compo and made everything yourself, probably should have used some royalty free music from online since my game has no music.
 Duch#1157: yes, you can edit everything on your page but not the actual game
 Mr.Boda#3589: its pretty farrr
 Clickan Seventh#5072: Game Jams teach you two things: Fail Hard and Take Breaks.
 Giga chad#0085: so is this server just gonna be open till next year?
 Penguinmanereikel#3708: Get lucky
 USER#8646: can i still change my game status
 BottleFish#6146: Hi guys, how to get rated?
 Kyo Ricardo#4586: Polymars? no way 👀
 Wompfbeere#0090: try to take some breaks from time to time, and plan to do so before you start 👍
also refreshes your productivity
 N8#2718: it finally worked thanks
 Lex#2782: Really is XD
 JJfriends#3686: My game is full of bugs but polymers and n8dev played it so idc anymore lmao
 Antidissmist#5795: what if we do the jam on a leap day
 NalaFala38290#9305: I have 1
 [killcode3.0]#6580: who reviews all the games initially, certainly not mark?
 Kyo Ricardo#4586: I have 0
 Ostro#3849: man ive seen some of the submissions, and people here are really talented
 Lex#2782: If anyone wants me to play their game send it to my dms :)
 KevinOB#7686: Am i able to change the name of my game in the itch page?
 sqrt#9237: where is your game
 Hobusu#5033: You've been told no to that multiple times, if we see you asking about posting your game outside that channel again we're going to be timing you out
 Michel#2879: there's a jam called infinity jam it got 7 years or 77 years or something couldn't remember
 theChief#0001: You can edit your post.
 Bourgir#8575: So sad, I never used itch.io :( I thought that I submitted the game but I just  created its page...
 [killcode3.0]#6580: I uploaded with 10 minutes to spare, with no beta testing, it's broken af, barely playable
I'm just hoping the main gameplay mechanic/concept is unique enough to get a shout out from mark
 ESC#8775: Same boi
 Relis#1309: hey thats one more than mine 😂  should be proud
 Trev#4563: had that issue earlier. wait a little bit to try and upload.
 Digitaldude555#5515: I have zero
 Penguinmanereikel#3708: Can’t imagine how that could have happened
 JuliusCube#8501: what if I just... made a game jam that lasts for 100 years. nothing's stopping me from doing that. at least i dont think there is. well except for ageing i suppose
 GigglesandGlasses#8651:  it took ours like 30 minutes to finally appear
 Qusai#6778: Only 1 have rated my game 🥲
 King Sol#2650: You can edit it
 Mr.Boda#3589: guys can i plz do it here i accidently typoed thw wrong thinng in the   and now i must wait 5 hours plaz
 SAFT_Morlol#2702: I think I might get a game done until there submission closes 🤣
 N8#2718: um - my upload cover image still isn't working... anyone else having this problem?
 Trev#4563: 5 days it said
 Avadak#8772: ouch, man sorry
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: I think it's a week
 VVVVV#3486: Uploaded the wrong version lol, classic
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: keep promotion to  !
 JuliusCube#8501: if I ever make a full steam release game that is actually good then i will definitely submit it to there.
it probably wouldnt be anything that could win me the decade jam but it would... exist i guess.
 Wallie#9818: For how long can you rate games? It's midnight here
 ChiptuneKirby#7868: lol I can't believe that exists
 Mr.Boda#3589: make a 1hour game jam like a small game jam u can maybbe make it this year 
 pizzascript#2833: when can i check your streaming schedule  ?
 N8#2718: oh thats cool
 Trev#4563: gmtk compo like ludum dare
 Santia#2861: Same for us, I introduced a bunch of friends to game development by forming a team for this jam. It was great :3
 Avadak#8772: as you soon as you upload game 211111111 bugs show up... classic haaha
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: there can be shorter or longer game jams - i was part of a group for beginner gamedev/jammers that does seven day jams called beginner circle, not sure whether they're still going, but i did my first jam with people with them and it was good - they had good numbers too, 150 partecipants for their first jam
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: I should just submit every game on my itch account to that jam
 JJfriends#3686: yooo n8dev played my game, and theres so many bugs
 King Sol#2650: I think I will, I quite like my game loop!
 Acu1000#5560: the what now
 Lunar#4998: ah alright thank you!
 [killcode3.0]#6580: 3 days seem ideal IMO
a third day to beta test and optimize and make music
 noidstruct#4545: still struggling to get mine up 😔
 Mark Brown#6982: Historically has been 48 hours! Probably will be next year, but never say never...
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: did the image problem fix?
 Santia#2861: Yes but you can also take your game jam project and make more out of it, lots of great games started as ideas from gamejams
 Arihan10#7379: AYYY the cover worked!!!
 Jekirutu#4959: I think GameJolt hasn't updated their jam feature in 6 years. It doesn't work well anymore...
 theChief#0001: There's also a decade jam on itch - 10 years 😂
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: if anything it's a good way for itch to test if they've fixed the servers up
 King Sol#2650: I think a 7 day jam I could have added some polish!
 Acu1000#5560: there are longer ones, many last a whole week
 (유)니티 좋음/나찰 니티#7281: We had 50 hours this year
 Trev#4563: itch is the only real platform i can think of that allows anyone to upload games. i know gamejolt can do the same but im not sure if they have a jam feature. either way i personally prefer itch
 Lunar#4998: are GMTK game jams always 48 hours? or are there longer ones?
 Taccos#1054: so it will auto update after a while?
 Santia#2861: thx to all the people who helped out with this gamejam, was really fun even if it was super stressful lol
 theChief#0001: Only if I can too for being such a wonderful mod helper ❤️
 AlpalcaLad#2549: at least then there wouldnt be a flood of entries i guess
 Mark Brown#6982: can i take a cut
 BoreasHe#8027: It's 4 am now I gonna get some rest, gn(or gm) everyone 🛌🏻
 Michel#2879: If I was god I would punish people by forcing them to learn java instead of sending them to hell
 theChief#0001: Yes every dev has to pay the $100 steam fee, I see no issues with this 😉
 Arihan10#7379: Don't think Steam does game jams lol
 FryDev#0372: GMTK Ludum Dare collab
 snuffysam#2767: What game platform has more server bandwidth than itch? Should GMTK collab with Steam next year? lol
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Slowmode back down to 1m
 theChief#0001: Itch is having issues atm
 Taccos#1054: i added an image in itch but i cant see the image in the game jam itch page?
 Trev#4563: turndown slowmode i dont want to wait 2 minutes to send messages :(
 King Sol#2650: I made a game about the grim reaper 😦
 theChief#0001: If you didn't upload the project, you have to play and rate a number of random games before you can pick which games to rate
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Basically non-submitters have to play and rate 10 (I think) random games before they can rate particular games to prevent vote manipulation
 Michel#2879: u r not a solo dev if u have god. checkmate
 N8#2718: uhh whats the random game rule
 MikeHazeJr#6582: Not to mention, a lot of them are also made by teams, not just solo devs
 DumbCow#8906: the cover takes so long to upload
 nizbel#9979: Wow, I will refrain from looking at other games for a few hours. Gotta enjoy the fuzzy feeling of fulfilling 90% of the mechanics as a solo dev
 theChief#0001: Play and rate and comment on a bunch of games! That's the best way to get other people to notice your game ☺️
 LTCat#9725: How did you upload the cover?
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Please keep promotion to !
 Acu1000#5560: well it's just more experienced people
 Staffy#4851: Oh, wait, mine just finished uploading 😄 Thanks for answering 🙂
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: I looked into this a couple of years ago, out of curiosity. In a word: **yikes**
 Mechafinch#8393: rip
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Compare you to you, not to professional developers
 snuffysam#2767: I had like no issues uploading images lol. I guess I did my thumbnail yesterday, but I did my banner today so idk
 N3R4ZZuRR0#4334: This is what their admin said 2 years ago for a similar query: "Hey all, problem should be resolved now. Sorry about the downtime, we did a migration today that impacted the zip extraction server. It’s not necessary to reupload any files, all pending extractions should resume and complete. Reply to me if you’re still having issues. Thanks".
 Snake#2774: Makes sense, thanks
 King Sol#2650: I thought I did really well, then I saw all these AAA titles the team devs are pumping out lmao. I'm so ashamed. 😅
 Michel#2879: next theme: make us a website.
 Aryajp#0786:  and the team, thanks again for hosting an awesome gamejam! Lots of fun as usual! ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
 Digitaldude555#5515: oh man the games are so good, usually the games are not very good in itchio jams
 theChief#0001: That would 100% make the problem worse 😂
 StormCodes#9924: took about an hour tbh
 Trev#4563: gmtk should have its own hosting website
 vide0gamer#5404: same
 theChief#0001: I only worked about 20 hours total, I managed it too xD
 Staffy#4851: Did you just wait for a really long time or did it just work when you tried again?
I've been trying for what seems like forever 😦
 9sven6#5617: I know, but it is still not working...
 Mark Brown#6982: They both love and hate being the host of the biggest online jam 😄
 Acu1000#5560: I am solo dev and I made it with quite a bit of time left, even though I slept 10 hours each night
 nicompany#4718: Thanks for this amazing Game Jam! Unfortunatеly i didn't upload my game because of crash, but it was valuable experience, thanks!❤️
 Mechafinch#8393:  you can change the game's page i.e. description, tags, images, etc. just not the game files
 ;paperclíp.#1371: The center option for the text description doesn't save for me
 StarMan#4559: Kinda fax tho
 Viciouz6#4491: anyone else has a bug where the game bugs out by only using the "full screen" button on the webplayer?
 Michel#2879: I hope Gmtk doesn't get on itch's blacklist for fucking up their servers every year lmao
 King Sol#2650: Also solo devs: OH GOD I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME!
 Teslobo#8274: pressing a game on that page opens its voting page, no?
 nekotheasparagus#0809: Solo devs: 😎
 fp#6298: if the game is broken can I link to a v2
 snuffysam#2767: Nope, you don’t get to know any total scores until reviews end.
Which is fair, imagine you get someone saying “I just rated your game 🥰” and then your score suddenly drops
 Rubyy#2486: damn, lost track of time. though the submissions ended in an hour
 StormCodes#9924: yeah and tried every 10 minutes
 FlashCubez#4239: I am not sure how good Mark's PC is, but I hope it's a supercomputer at least
 voithos#0258: Yep, mine is as well
 Mark Brown#6982: We don't stop until Itch.io doesn't get back up again
 Michel#2879: i recognised the last 30 hours as subimssion time. lol.
 DevByMarc#7784: Not until we reach 6.9 mark
 ;paperclíp.#1371: is there a way to get other team members listed on the Authors section? I added them as contributers but it doesn't show.
 N3R4ZZuRR0#4334: Is anyone else's HTML game stuck on "Loading game for the first time..."?
 subwave [Rolling Dice]#0193: Whoever made the 3D game "Keep Rolling" about the hands grabbing the dice, please know that you are a genius!
 Acu1000#5560: Naah we need to crash itch again next year
 Arihan10#7379: Did you just wait?
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: I think only uploading accounts are exempt from the random games rule
 theChief#0001: This is down to itch, sorry! They'll have to play the random queue first
 Taccos#1054: how?
 FryDev#0372: interesting how there’s not much more signups but many more submissions
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Where can I ask for help about teammates and stuff?
Everyone on my team has to play 10 games while I dont. Even thought they're all admins/contributors.
 BeetJuicer#1315: Nothing like a first jam to ruin my sleep schedule
 Snake#2774: Can I see what ratings I got? I can only see that I have 1 rating, but not the score
 StormCodes#9924: Wooooh cover image finally added
 voithos#0258: My HTML also appears to be broken :\ Do you happen to be using Godot?
 ;paperclíp.#1371: ooo ty mine worked ❤️
 krisis in a jar#0904: so true lmao
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: it's certanly something worth considering, we'll make improvements for next year as per usual!
 The Handsome  Cat#6115: NOOOOOOO
 Michel#2879: will  you reduce slowmode period as people are starting to calm down
 SlamBamActionman#7160: yes pls thanks
 JuliusCube#8501: ive said this already, but next jam they shouldnt even tell people that theres gonna be extra time. They should just say that after the 48 hours its over. And when inevitably itch crashes you guys just say "itch crashed so were giving you guys some extra time".
We're all master procrastinators we waste all our time and leave it to the last minute.
 buickmle#3892: My html is broken but at least I have the download
 paulpork#7383: Guys image uploading should be fine now. I just upload my cover finally
 theChief#0001: They definitely are
 Viciouz6#4491: lol found out the bug, so by changing the webplayer to fullscreen my game bugs out. Interesting
 LemonScripts#5768: No i think
 Xypes#1040: i still cant
 Valkyrrii#3264: I got it in but it took Awhile.
 theChief#0001: Play and rate other games!
Make a decent cover image 
Make a good short description
 StarMan#4559: I think that's what I was meaning to say I was just being dumb with my wording of it
 froeg#0757: are ratings anonymous?
 NalaFala38290#9305: I managed to upload 3 screenshots
 FlashCubez#4239: ya. sorry slow mode is making me reply very fast
 grAvity#8487: how do I rate a game?
 Prine#6562: Alright, time to rate games that have 0 ratings
 KevinOB#7686: Any word on image uploads?
 zeidXD#0210: whats your game
 Aquila#3385: Same here!
 Eggmaster#9544: Is there any way to help your game get rated?
 AlpalcaLad#2549: if anyone wants me to try their games dm me
 ;paperclíp.#1371: is it better to spam refresh or just wait before pressing save to upload a cover image
 Digitaldude555#5515: its been 10 years since I have been trying to upload a cover image.
 paulpork#7383: People never learn that you SHOULD make a playable game and upload it before the 48 hr deadline
 shenalkm#1022: Oh! Thanks a lot! had no idea
I'll edit the description asking everyone to download the windows version
 1Am2Good4You#4414: Can I update the page used for submission safely? Or should I create a new page for it
 Acu1000#5560: it was made clear several times, it's people's fault for not reading
 theChief#0001: Yep, WebGL builds are well known for having a bunch of bugs. I rarely submit a web version
 Arihan10#7379: I've let it load for an hour but still no luck :/
 xono#1000: did you just sit and let it load?
 SpellCast#5277: the game jam was fun this year
 Aeph#4622: are the cover images working yet?
 FlashCubez#4239: Finally the cover image updated for me
 StarMan#4559:  Actually nevermind my fault  I was just bein stupid
 LTCat#9725: I have the same problem...
 theChief#0001: Once the rating period is over, submissions will unlock ☺️
 Shorkey#8615: Next year make it clearer that peeps should work on the game for 48 hours, I think a lot of people took the extra 2 hours to continue working, what made them miss the deadline ofc
 Michel#2879:   will slowmodd be gone. Since people will start to calm down alitte bit
 what I discovered about my self is that when I am under pressure, I get too competetive. to the point of staying awake 32 hours straight without feeling tired
 Valkyrrii#3264: Got the cover image up and it's tbh some of the best artwork I did for the project.
 Good K#8995: I don't think submission will ever be allowed again for this jam
 Benyock#5257: Ah… so I needed to create a project and then submit the link of the project as an entry ?
 theChief#0001: Well they should've, we were very clear 😂
 eMChe#3779: Managed to upload screenshots, but not the cover image
 Digitaldude555#5515: I'm sorry...its over.
 ESC#8775: Tmw you can upload screenshots but not cover image
 Omegnight#7081: People did not recognized those as "extra submission time" to be honest
 ;paperclíp.#1371: My images wont upload to my page 😢
 Acu1000#5560: unfortunately no way to update
 Penguinmanereikel#3708: Lucky i submitted hours before the deadline and no one’s rated mine get
 Casper#6361: Image uploading is still down?
 z_richman#7356: Itch isn't recognizing that I'm an admin on one of the games! It's making me do the queue and comments won't show I submitted a game too!
 theChief#0001: We had two hours this year lol
 Amirs#4779: Is there any way to make a update. My game has no texture in main Menu.. I fixed it but sadly i cannot upload. No Main Menu Texture means no players playing the game :(
 DevByMarc#7784: Cool, my little game currently have 1 rating 🥳
 NalaFala38290#9305: nobody rated my game yet
 absolutelyivy#3850: bro
 Syton#9947: Hey guys! how do you get your game noticed? if anyone interesting in checking my game out and I will check his let me know by DM me 🙂
 StarMan#4559: Next jam they should have an hour to submit your games or something
 vide0gamer#5404: which one did you make
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: discovering many things about myself through jams. for example: when i am under pressure and i have to make sprites i Just default to weird monsters
 Hobusu#5033: Correct!
 Michel#2879: this server will be still open for the rest of the voting era right?
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: DM it to me and I'll rate it
 Guido Meo#3933: If you have a game playable on browser DM me! I have done a game playable on browser too if you want to try it! :D
 theChief#0001: Only how many people have rated. You'll get your score once mark uploads his video
 eMChe#3779: Ahaha got email from itch which says "You're missing a cover image, upload it!" 😄
 Santia#2861: Trying desperately to get the cool artwork uploaded that my friend made Sadge
 Eggmaster#9544: Are you able to see your ratings?
 Fox#3756: Try changing the compression format under "Publishing Settings in the player settings; "brotli" never works for me. Some people say "gzip" works, but only "none" works for me.
 paulpork#7383: Buried by 6000 other games, my submission has been rated by two strangers. Crazy
 theChief#0001: You had to link it on the "submit project" page - creating a project through that link doesn't automatically add it to the jam unfortunately
 AF_Husky#8316: There are various nuanced ways the WebGL build from unity can differ from the windows build.  It can take some work to iron out specific bugs that can appear when switching platforms, it depends on how you coded it initially and what features you are trying to use.
 Hobusu#5033: I already asked a mod about this and we're leaving them open for just a bit longer, but they'll be closing soon!
 theChief#0001: Be proud of what you've done, share your link and try get some feedback. Unfortunately it is not part of the jam and we can't make exceptions.
 Benyock#5257: Any way to mark is as part of the jam ?
 Penguinmanereikel#3708: Should we close all of the other game jam help chats?
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: interesting stat from the submissions page: most people created their own art, but it's an even split on if they made their own music
 Michel#2879: i think Ill try not to open the site till tommorw's evening. Getting 5 surprise comments is better than one at a time.
After reading my comment back: ||"getting 5 together is better than one at a time"|| sounds sus
 theChief#0001: If you didn't submit to the jam, you have to rate 25 random games before you can choose which one you want to vote on - so yes, it's open to everyone!
 Kapcpa#2087: pain i just now find out my game has a bug when a boss battle starts and it crash so you cant battle against final boss  🥲
 Astrallion#3773: I couldn't submit my game because of the crash. The game is ready, what should I do?
 LOPSTERu#3902: wow there are a lot of puzzle games and i cant puzzle game today
 Hobusu#5033: It's too late to add or edit any game files, yes
 SAFT_Morlol#2702: So can everyone with an itch account vote or only the people who submitted?
 Lawn#1538: You can upload your game thumbnails, video links to play throughs, and more details to your game page at any time. It might be best to give the itch.io servers a break for an hour or two before trying again if you're still having issues.
anyone want to try?
 shenalkm#1022: Guys I haven't built unity WebGL builds before - __My game's windows version is working perfectly but the webGL build has weird bugs__
**Any idea why?**
 Prine#6562: Oh boi time to rate
 !khaled#2924: is it too late to make a webgl version ?
 Snootnoot#3773: IS anyone else having issues uploading a game thumbnail?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: (furiously reloading my statistics page waiting for the views and browser plays number to reach one million)
 Ethann#0423: can anyone upload images cuz mines just loading
 swarm#1128: Congrats to the mod team for their patience 😄
 Augs#3262: Images see to be down still, yes.
 syelan34#3258: As far as I know you can only see how many ratings you have
 theChief#0001: You do get a rating count and you can see all the comments people post 😉 that's what I end up obsessively refreshing!
 MrBen#0001: yoo my game is in 6th row by popularity :D
 Michel#2879: oh fine. Would be better to me than stressing and looking at the rating every 2 seconda
 Camden Martin#8590: I'm mad that my game didn't submit
 FireSquid#8882: thanks!
 The Mayday Man#8467: me fighting sans instead of rating games
 theChief#0001: Not necessarily
 Digitaldude555#5515: If you fall below the average ratings for a game, your score will be destroyed. at least thats how it is in other jams, so you need to get average or above ratings.
 Valkyrrii#3264: not that I can see on my end, but some people got it working.
 Kurutte#3765: Darn I just thought of a better Game concept that'd be more fun than what I made man I wanna reverse time rq lol
 Reinspieler#2067: Images still down???
 Eggmaster#9544: Do everyone’s games get judged eventually?
 Ell#3559: i liked the theme but it wasn't as broad as some of the others we had on previous gmtk jams
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Dang, shame it didn't get in. Looks really good!
 Lawn#1538: And no.
 Lawn#1538: Yes.
 Jemmeh#7117: okay thank you ;;
It didn't say locked or anything until I tried to add a new build . I hear you that we made a mistake just saying that seems unclear with the "there will be an additional two hours on the clock to submit" and that may need to be clarified a bit next year
Admittedly we are new to game jams
 PangolinPope#7175: are game thumbnails working yet?
 Redline#7370: anyways GG to everyone who submitted imma go the sleeping thing now cya + 🧀
 Scolon#4218: Guys remember to play and rate as many games that haven't been rated yet as fast as possible
 Xypes#1040: cant upload pictures
 Aegard#2715: To be clear it is upload (and was uplaod way before the end of the jam) but no one will see it because it's not part of the Jam group ^^
 Giga chad#0085: bruh is it possible that ur game just doesn't get viewed by people and u just dont get a rank
 SlamBamActionman#7160: If you've got the gamejam badge in the top right you're good, if not, unfortunately we're past the deadline and we can't make exceptions - you should be proud of the work you've done though!
 theChief#0001: You can't see it til mark makes it public with his video, so probably a week or two after the voting period ends
 Lunar#4998: this was a really challenging theme, i look forward for the next game jam!! good luck everyonee
 Benyock#5257: But how ? I created my entry following the link on gmtk website . We needed to add a taf or something ?
 The Handsome  Cat#6115: how did mark become sooo popular in game development
 9bitmax#3119: bye @everyone
 Mr_Hobbes_#9766: ya you're allowed to update the itch page, just not the builds
 Feathami#3295: Our game was upload and update but the new build at been erase by Itch.Io at the deadline aaaaaaa
 nicompany#4718: right
 hedge#8161: when does voting period end?
 TheGreatMurloc#8017: Can you submit the game now if it was published before the deadline?
Cuz we forgot to register it to the jam...
FuuuuuuuuuuuuuuUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-
 Omari_#3622: I'm going to get very depressed about this lmao
 parson#3182: idk what the hate is on this theme I loved it
 Crafto#4284: you're not alone, i get a mysterious bug at the end 😆
 Michel#2879: you can't see your rating before the voting era ends right?
 theChief#0001: Itch having issues! It'll work again eventually 😂
 Lawn#1538: You can *after* the jam winners are announced.
 ESC#8775: Same
 Tom Ragtag (He/Him)#8723: Well done everyone!
If you submitted a game or didn't, pat yourselves on the back for the incredible achievement!
 Aeph#4622: not what i was expecting but enjoyed it nonetheless
 noidstruct#4545: bro i still can't upload my cover image lmao 💀
 FlashCubez#4239: If we find a bug, is it ok to update the description indicating the bug?
 theChief#0001: That's the time until the review period ends!
 Santia#2861: everyone tryin to upload images rn
 Digitaldude555#5515: yeah the theme was pretty bad. 😔
 The Mayday Man#8467: dude i though for so long that the theme would be something to do with marbles because of the countdown and the "roll" and ive been making a marble game for a month
 AF_Husky#8316: Honestly like the theme a lot this year :)
 Mukhavertolet#2243: the theme was so fun
 theChief#0001: Nope, sorry all uploads are locked
 Arihan10#7379: what is the countdown with 4 days on the page?
 Artem#0069: Nothing blocks you from uploading it
 Eggmaster#9544: Boy am I glad I submitted mine early
 FireSquid#8882: i'll play it, dm me if you want
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: can we add different builds for the game after the deadline? i'd like to add a windows download jic the browser version doesn't work for some people
 Mark Brown#6982: We had the most submitted games ever - so I think that's a pretty big thumbs up for the theme!
 Penguinmanereikel#3708: It’s also more limiting than “roll of the dice” because you can just make it dice *themed*
 theChief#0001: This game is not part of the jam
 Aegard#2715: Damn, we've been doing this jam for 5 years with our team and for the first time, the whole team completely forgot to click on the "submit to the jam" button for absolutely no reason... 🤐😭
Does anyone know if there's a sort of "non-official submission" at least, to get feedback from people, even if the project doesn't count as an entry? Because having it as a random itch.io project won't probably get ti a lot of visibility 😥
 Benyock#5257: Hi, we published a game at 21h23 but I can’t see it in the challenge entries
 Lawn#1538: Once again, well done everyone!
 AromaticA#3738: random chance is a pretty broad theme
 Lawn#1538: What an effort.
 Lawn#1538: That link is where you'll find all 6k+ games created over the last two days!
 Spaceshark YT#4155: NOOOOO MY WINDOWS BUILD DOESNT WORK, ONLY MY MAC BUILD
 Teslobo#8274: yeah you can always not rate a game if you feel like it egregiously flaunts the theme
 Digitaldude555#5515: its over bro... its over.
 Mark Brown#6982: Hasn't been for a while - we found that people generally adhere to the theme anyway so not necessary
 Seinaru#6185: We were literally one minute late, but that’s okay, we did great and so did you all guys. Let’s make it next year!
 Lawn#1538: Yes...
 sevenzik#3331: Does anyone have problem with uploading cover?
 birdieBoy#5366: i figured it out, you have to scroll your browser out to 67% to see all of it
 Teslobo#8274: yes
 Koolento#6688: wait is there no adherence to the theme raiting this time? is there a reason for that?
 Not ur Ecsy#4556: Random bug and crash uploaded. Wish me luck :*
 Taccos#1054: can we vote there?
 DevByMarc#7784: Will be reveal when voting ends
 RGBCube#8833: *i agree with this lol*
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Nope, post in 
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: nope, keep all promotion to  please!
 theChief#0001: Yep! ☺️
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Sorry to hear. We did provide 2 hours for upload along with the extra 25 minutes due to itch.io hickups
 MaryStrawberry#4672: _suggestions for mods to ping us when we can upload cover images_
 theChief#0001: Unfortunately not, sorry! Itch is very clear, if you delete your build it is gone
 Aeph#4622: same here, also cant upload screenshots
 Furia#5143: Can I upload a cover image even if I already submitted the game?
 Jemmeh#7117: There's no way to roll it back to the state it was before? We had a build turned in by the deadline but even tho it's locked now it lets you delete the file
you can't add a file but you can delete whats there
 The Mayday Man#8467: how do i see my ratings
 StormCodes#9924: In your game edit page, you can enable a full screen button that will scale up your game to the size of the screen
 Wabadaba#4373: How do you get the itch embed on discord to show the cover image? ive got the image downloading but it's just not showing
 theChief#0001: It is already past the deadline! Your game will not be able to be added, sorry. We can't make exceptions.
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Unfortunately that will probably turn out to be the case
 Acu1000#5560: rip
 Maax#7773: Same here. Mate 😄
 USER#8646: Edited mine earlier and it worked
 Aspharon#1693: Turns out if you upload your project from the submit form it doesn't actually submit it - you have to re-do that step after uploading, so ours isn't technically in the jam. Whoops
 nxsnow#2470: Does anyone have a hard time uploading the cover image right now?
 Foxy Grandpa#6514: My team's game has been attempting to upload for over 50 mins now, I haven't left the page once, if I reload the page and attempt again, will it be past the deadline?
 Digitaldude555#5515: the top 100 shortest games will be played.
 birdieBoy#5366: when you set the window type, theres go to other screen and stay in small window, what do you mean by fullscreen button
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: That two hour window was 6pm-8pm UK time, plus the extensions due to itch's stability issues
 absolutelyivy#3850: is mark gonna play all of the games this year or does he remain a coward
 The Handsome  Cat#6115: no images, an unplayable level and the restart button skips you the level
 Wallie#9818: Still can't upload any image 😩
 theChief#0001: 2 hours beyond the original 6pm deadline - it was then further extended til about 25 past 8
 pizzascript#2833: at what time will mark stream?
 Eggmaster#9544: How will we know how our games did?
 RGBCube#8833: i found a game `Dice Lands`
it only has a webgl build
but it lags so hard that its literally unplayable :/
 BardiaGames#5987: Does anyone know why the download form is unavailable?
 Jemmeh#7117: yeah but the rules said there's 2 hours more to submit I thought we could update the game file but it just deleted what was there. 😭
 Laugic ❄☃#0818: Good job everyone! That was super fun this year
 Panda S#8673: can anyone help me i canot add images to my page
 Gumy#7061: How did the submissions go?
 wumpus#3512: nothing you can do about it now though!
 KyleLab#7161: Thanks! I meant for more complicated configurations like Full House, Small Straight, Large Straight, Three of Kind, etc 🙏
 Viciouz6#4491: Strange, my game sometimes load correctly and sometimes the textmestpro texts are gone. Using Unity webbuild, anyone seen this before?
 no_ones#4897: Is it important to set file to released?...its submited but I kept option as prototype ..n public
 Hex#8650: thanks for the help with the name/link issue everyone!
 katiepotatoes#1609: The image upload worked for me just now!
 Amaunator#5034: Congrats to everyone who made it all the way through! You guys are killer
open "during the voting period"
 The Handsome  Cat#6115: how is in this chat in the middle of december ?
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: I'm afraid the deadline passed about 15 minutes ago
 Acu1000#5560: they're explained in the yt video
 prestonexists#9431: i got the game in with a few seconds remaining!
 wyrm_slayr#7477: Is there somewhere on the jam page that goes into further detail on the judging categories?
 Jasper#7906: I changed my link with still a few hours to go. My observations:
- The jam entry is linked to the project, not to the link
- The old link is kept in place and refers to the new one for at least some period of time
 sceb#4224: i forgot to turn on loop audio on my music 💀
 MikeHazeJr#6582: I haven't made a submission before this jam, so I'm not sure, but I was feeling the same since my game must be downloaded rather than played in the browser. It's practically guaranteed to get overlooked!
 Jemmeh#7117: wait I thought we had time for submission but it says the game file is gone ;; i didn't even hit save I was just trying to change it
 SlamBamActionman#7160: I think you can edit titles, yeah. That should be fine.
 StormCodes#9924: you will always have clipping if you reduce size, you need to hit the canvas size you set for your UI/Camera as the bare minimum... for scrolling issue do you see this when you click the fullscreen button?
 Eggmaster#9544: How and when will we know how our games did as far as judging?
 Digitaldude555#5515: oh feel bad for you man.
 Teslobo#8274: No ETA on this, it works when it works unfortunately
 Lawn#1538: You can update all the game details and images, without it affecting your submission. DO NOT delete your zip/html, you've been warned.
 Teh_Turtle#6620: When rating games what is "Presentation" supposed to be?
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: You should be able to upload pictures and customize your jam page as itch's servers recover!
 Enkrypt#6893: Anyone got an idea of how long it usually takes for image submission to work again?
 Teslobo#8274: 1 week
 no_ones#4897: Hey
 Hex#8650:  if we made a typo in the title/itch link (😅) can we correct it or will it break things in regards to submission?
 Viola_Buddy#6763: How long is the rating period?
 SandQuick#1920: i give up, no more jam games for me. 😦
 Lawn#1538: On itch.io!
 PatateNouille#5627: 🥳 🥳  made it in time !
just by a hair so my game is missing so much polish, but it works and it is submitted to the jam ! damn that was close, itch servers dying at the end always are the most stress inducing thing ever haha,
but well, happy to have completed a jam, and I really want to add some more to the game,
thanks for this wonderful event, now let's rate everyone else's hard work !
 MaryStrawberry#4672: but how about pictures? it was failing an hour before the jam even started
is that not locked by you?
 LucasGostarMeme#1040: 👊
 SAFT_Morlol#2702: Thanks to everyone to GMTK Team who made that jam possible. It was such an cool challenge and experience (It was my first time participating in a Game Jam)
 Taccos#1054: where do we vote the games?
 Omari_#3622: why didn't they give even more time?
 Shimp#0064: I want to congratulate everyone for surviving this wonderful event! Its been wonderful experience, thanks to mods and Mark for always helping everyone, will definitely enjoy coming back next year but with a good game
 Santia#2861: I'm so happy lmao, sorry to everyone who didn't get as lucky as us
 Lawn#1538: You can change your cover image and game details at any point post-jam submission.
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: If we make an exception for one game we'll have to make one for everybody, very sorry!
 9bitmax#3119: i might join next 🙂
 Yolwoocle#6689: Rip cover image
 monke (real)#6818: Depends on the number of sides the calculation would be "(1/the number of sides -1) * number of dice"
 Digitaldude555#5515: I will never be able to submit cover image feels bad man.
 froeg#0757: same haha
 SlamBamActionman#7160: There are some issues with itch.io and image files at the moment, especially noticeable with thumbnails. If you can't upload a thumbnail for your game now do not worry, you will be able to add a thumbnail (or other things like screenshots) even after the voting period has begun as it's part of the game's itch.io page. They are aware of the issue!
 birdieBoy#5366: when i set the size, there's little scroll bars. And when i set it to be smaller than the canvas size its clipped
 MrRoboman#9804: Haha😄
 JTjutajoh#0043: Is there really NO way? You can see that the build was submitted on time and it would be a huge shame for all of our work to go to waste
 sceb#4224: makes me worried nobody will vote for mine due to no marketing
 Mr. Tophat#9572: Question, will we receive any kind of confirmation for whether the game qualifies and whether there are any issues with the submission?
 Mr. Lonely#5553: Next one, I'm making a team. I could barely get mine in.
 JWilde#3125: The trick is to upload the thumbnail image before the jam starts.
 StarMan#4559: For some reason I tried to upload my game but it's not working  😦
 Falcon#3043: can you add screenshots now?
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Sorry but no more uploads after the deadline!
 eMChe#3779: It's more than 0kb so itch is struggling))
 MikeHazeJr#6582: Me too. I got the foundation built, but didn't get to implement the scoring system or powerups, which are what actually make it a game. It is also missing the win-condition which means only the one level is accessible. That said, I intend to finish this game once the jam is done and submissions are allowed again. I think it has a lot of potential to be actually a fun and difficult strategy puzzle game.
 Quentincroyable#5223: Good job everyone ! And good sleep to all, see you next year :)
 RGBCube#8833: page background doesnt wanna upload either, so its *all* images lol
 MaryStrawberry#4672: hey we can't upload cover pics :/
 JC Denton#8819:  is it possible to resubmit a corrupted EXE? It's impossible to open the executable on Windows right now 😦
 DEDSEC_SKIDROW#6114: Me too! And I started learning making game few days back because of this jam!
 Woum#5790: Not the right moment to start playing game imo, we all struggle updating our games 😄
 vide0gamer#5404: I couldnt add a lot of what i wanted in but considering im doing this solo I'm really proud of what i did
 katiepotatoes#1609: I’m trying to upload a cover image too and it’s not working, must be on their end
 Teslobo#8274: Correct
 White-Sparrow#8780: same here!
 Kira#7896: Congratulations to everyone on the jam!
 The Handsome  Cat#6115: hey, ii can't upload my new images, and it's correct size
 StormCodes#9924: I had scaling issues, but it fixed itself when I set the html window size to the exact size of the canvas in the game
 BricksParts#5032: So the fact we cannot upload cover art is not intentional, correct? We *are* allowed to edit the itch io page, just not the uploads. So the issue is likely that it's just really slow cause everyone is trying to update their page?
 BardiaGames#5987: What? Why?
 Poweries#8748: Good Job everyone!
 PlatosMan#2789: Same
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Please keep all game promotion to  !
 FancyReckless#2560: test
 Wallie#9818: Everyone. unfortunately my thumbnail is also looking pretty non existend
 Teslobo#8274: if not, it did not submit
 Wenlong#7472: My cover pic is only 30kb idk what itch is whining about
 Delphine Noel#1196: I am very happy I finally joined a game jam.
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: If you've got the gamejam badge in the top right you're good, if not, unfortunately we're past the deadline and we can't make exceptions - you should be proud of the work you've done though!
 birdstone#3073: congratulations everyone that submitted a game or learned something
 KyleLab#7161: I know the jam is over now but did anyone here find a good resource for calculating probabilities of rolling multiple dice and getting different results? I'm not good at math so it's way over my head.
 spooncats#0287: no you're actually 364 days early
 breadroll#8240: you can manually set the size to a smaller one i think? or is it a window scaling problem on the html build? if that's the case, there's probably some setting in the project settings that can change that
 MrRoboman#9804: Too late to form a team?
 Kyo Ricardo#4586: 🤓 "We can't add more time"
😎 Upload your game to itch.io after the jam and then rate yourself
 Kxffie#6889: its a genuine uhh no clue what language it is but a genuine uploading website
 ChipmunkDev#1808: who else couldn't compile?
 Teslobo#8274: Ongoing issue itch is having
 Amit.H#0786: Include that in your itch page if you want
 Arihan10#7379: May I ask when this was? My 1080x1080 cover has been going on forever.
 extroias#5225: change the viewport of your page
 Roiboi#2055: whoo
 Koolento#6688: already 600 reviews! go play some games everyone
 Tinch334#6298: Hey is there something to be done about images not uploading? They play a big part in whether someone decides to even play a game
 sceb#4224: banners and screenshots not loading for anyone else?
 Supuh#0468: Thanks for the jam everyone!
 Lawn#1538: ~~No. The rules require the game executes either from itch.io or via Windows.~~
 AquaduckStudio#0780: Haunted House: Dice til Dawn
 birdieBoy#5366: I submitted my game, but it's way too big for the viewport. Works when it's a windows exe. Is there anything i can do
 steve#7574: yo is it fine if i add a source code link?
 Kamigaru#7468: What is your game called? I'll check yours out too.
 Woum#5790: I'm really happy with what I've done, thanks Mark Brown, the mods and everyone that worked on that jam for the experience!
 tomster12#7972: this is a scam right
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: If you didn't submit it to the jam within the time limit then I'm afraid you won't be able to now
 theChief#0001: Nope!
 Lawn#1538: A lesson for next time!
 wyrm_slayr#7477: 🎉 🎉 🎉 🎉 🎉 🎉 🎉 🎉
 Boug#9534: Oh, nice! Is there a time limit for that too?
 BardiaGames#5987: GUYS PLEASE HELP ME
I uploaded my game but the page shows this
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Please keep all game promotion to  !
 Woomek#4366: Can I change the "did you make the art yourself"|  region? I did like 50/50 maybe nice to add
 ZedDev#4726: Done 😭 if only Unity had that option on by default, my build would have worked
 AF_Husky#8316: For future jams you guys need to remove the popular sort filter, it just creates a snowball effect for any games who submit earlier.
 hatoving#4710: i have a large feeling that nobody will be able to find my game cuz there's literally >6000 entries lmfao
eh, no matter though, after all the experience is what matters
 StarMan#4559: I finished my game but I can't submit it wth?
 Scolon#4218: Alright I have an hour or so to spare to play games, is it voting time?
 Amit.H#0786: You cannot. Unfortunately we're past the deadline and we can't make exceptions - you should be proud of the work you've done though!
 VanCastar#5425: Uhff a few ANNOYING bugs left in the game as I made a typo for time triggers...
After the asteroids end there should be enemies incoming but the time to live won't last that far since 15 seconds of empty time due to typo is too much to live 😄
BUT it is playable up to that point and with a good chance even to get through that...
Lovely jam tbh, and I really like how my game came to being.
Try it out.
 GreenData#2513: who else just found a game-breaking bug? TT
 SuperPenguinDev#0275:  Why is there a timer on  I didn’t write anything out the timer continued from what the channel originally was

 [killcode3.0]#6580:  I can't update my submitted build can I? Like if I wanted to add new music into the game?
 RomuloChatsDiscord#2771: Damn, I couldn't finish the game in time. Oh well, maybe next year. Still finishing it tho
 JTjutajoh#0043: My team submitted our game on time, but it isn't showing up under the jam's submissions page on itch. Any idea what's going on? It would REALLY suck to not be included with all the work we did

 MikeHazeJr#6582: Last year I was on a team that kind of fell apart due to regional disconnect, but during the year I have been just learning more and more and this year was able to come up with a concept that was simple enough to implement. I still didn't end up with the time (or energy, really) to finish it completely. Given another day or two I think I could have implemented the entire game. In the meantime, I will continue to polish this game post-jam and submit revisions. That is the only way to really get better.. keep working at it.

 Digitaldude555#5515: I did 30 and sometimes I screw up too. The key is always be aware of over scoping especially if you work alone, nearly every good game you see in james were made by 2/3 people doing art and programming separately. Just have one single game mechanic thats it and implement, rest is polish.

 Michel#2879: I like how the jam jumped from 2000 submissions to 6000 subimssions
 macleodian#7269: Forreal, 6,200 💀

 Nanto#2971: Awesome Jam.   Can't wait to play all those games.
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: make it public and thenn add it to the jam you have freakin 2 minutes
 SlamBamActionman#7160: I would avoid linking to anything external like that, don't want to make people think you are trying to link to another build

 AzE#0001: Why did you ping them 💀 💀 💀
 White-Sparrow#8780: I'm trying to upload a 37kb poster for 30 min 🤣
 Wallie#9818: Finally got through 😩
 Cornelius#4529: Bro my upload's stuck at full, what do I do 😭
 SentientSquirrel#7702: I tried to improve for a while by doing 3 hour game jams, made me faster though no better at game design
 froeg#0757: my game is too big for the browser screen on itch, how do i fix this?
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Mark, thanks for the jam! Its my first, and I've loved it 😄
 Victor#4383:  
We weren't aware of this compression error: Unable to parse Build/build GMTK22.framework.js.br! This can happen if build compression was enabled but web server hosting the content was misconfigured to not serve the file with HTTP Response Header "Content-Encoding: br" present. Check browser Console and Devtools Network tab to debug. We already uploaded the game but we are rebuilding it to reupload. Would it be a problem?
 Chidebe#4508: It's supposed to be Public. 
 5fm#0001: This was a fun experience, made my first game with a friend.
 kuaku#4031: hi everyone, I submited my game to itch, I have it on my page but I can't submit it to the jam site ;/ does anyone know what might be wrong?

 LN#4016: They are for me
 Good K#8995: I want to vote
 Casper#6361: It's just very very challenging to make a fun game in such a short period of time. Always downscale your idea and keep your expectations low.
 Bourgir#8575: How do you specifiy that you made the majority of the assets ?

 Dragondoodler222#1250: Itch isn't letting us submit, could we have a bit more time?
 breadroll#8240: The html should be named `index.html` when it's zipped for it to work!!
 L0rd#5654: Anyone has any tips? Itch wont load for me its always the same error or nothing at all
 InvidiousOne#6650: How does anyone improve at this? I've done four of these and if feels like nothing has improved from last time; I have an idea, everything breaks down, peogress slows, everything ends up totally busted, the games a bromen mess. The idea grows devoid of any real interest and becomes nothing but what feels like boring menus. Is it just me?
 AiiArief#3090: you won't find new bugs if you don't test it

 Nectar#2888: Can’t imagine waiting until last minute, good luck everyone

 Delphine Noel#1196: Less gooooooooooo boys it's done
 FireSquid#8882: In previous jams, people have had trouble playing my game on itch.io. My solution to this was to just host the game on my own website, which fixed the problem for most people. Assuming the game files on the website are the same as on itch, am I allowed to put a link to my website for people that couldn't get itch.io working?
 Kochan#8726: why "This jam is now over. It ran from June 11th 2021 at 9:03 PM to June 13th 2021 at 9:20 PM. View results" ?

 Juny5#1279: yes

 Lucis#4520: When I have submitted my game an hour ago, and I update it through itch like normal in the meantime, I dont have to **re-submit** it, right?

 Jellogramming#4653: 6000 games lets gooooooo

 SlamBamActionman#7160: There are some issues with itch.io and image files at the moment, especially noticeable with thumbnails. If you can't upload a thumbnail for your game now do not worry, you will be able to add a thumbnail (or other things like screenshots) even after the voting period has begun as it's part of the game's itch.io page. They are aware of the issue!

 Jhunter#4054: It’s back up looks like

 Taccos#1054: i see a badge does that 100% mean its submitted?
 RGBCube#8833: to be fair i already compressed an entire explosion sound effect into 255 bytes once

 ItsYoBoiChad#1806: I would definitely be interested in trying it out!

 Peewi#8572: at least game uploads are working
 AlpalcaLad#2549: nope
 Professor Pickles#8498: probably getting overloaded
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: So mine has columns and to-do lists, as well as flow charts, etc. Would you use that instead if it were released?
 MrBen#0001: Is it just me or every itch.io page is slowing down? 🤨
 AzE#0001: can y'all stop uploading images so I can do it 😎
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: top right of your page!

 Taccos#1054: it is
 Lunar#4998: the game is far from done but i guess its better to upload it than not upload anything, the game's core mechanics are there and its beatable
 Acu1000#5560: notepad
 Rareș#8101: and how do i resubmit?
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: IMAGES ARE WORKING FOR ME NOW :0

 syelan34#3258: i mean when you got to submit the game, it les you choose an existing project if you haven't submitted it or create a new project
 AzE#0001: 😎😎😎
 Redline#7370: unity crashed 😎
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Guys what do you use for planning your games? I'm coding my own planner, so wanted to see what you guys use
 AlpalcaLad#2549: what witchcraft have you used
 Hobusu#5033: Submissions are due ! Remember that __there will be **no exceptions** for late submissions__, so make sure to get your game uploaded and submitted now—__don't worry about images and formatting for now__, you can fix that even after the deadline!
 Tapu#9161: Go to desktop site, it doesn't show on mobile
 AJM-03#3713: How do people get those custom coloured game pages?
 MrBen#0001: dm me the link :)

 akaBl4ck#7384: ok so my web build is taking forever
 Itooh#5008: Project submitted! Impressed to see that the itch.io servers are still very responsive.
 Motor#0094: i actually hate gamemaker sometimes
the build my friend makes keeps going black after entering the first stage and im trying to export it for him but i dont have the subscription for it and yoyogames is telling me i cant buy a subscription because it thinks im using the wrong currency
😃
 WorkingJoe#4433: I'm just building a windows application from the game engine I'm using (Unigine), but no luck. Everything seems to work in the terminal but the meshes just don't show up...Oh well
 Ceding Tree#1081: What? WebGL worked for me
 Triggered#6897: Also turn on will run on browser (something like that if ifs for web)
 syelan34#3258: it's a really tiny selector thing above 'create project'
 GuyWithTime#7852: try reloading your game page
 MrBen#0001: Second message up in 
 Tapu#9161: ~~Maybe next maybe we'll have a bot to replace Slam's copy pasting job~~
 Digitaldude555#5515: I believe I can make the top 4000 with my game. 🤣
 Chamasssa#2341: Going through a lot of these games is gonna be fun. currently 4444 entries submitted
 redseiko#0001: We got WebGL working but teammate spent all morning working on it to resolve some builds.
 ◈・ Altaꐟ#9999: i think i dont need to upload my game.
 USER#8646: Where do i see
 SlamBamActionman#7160: If your game page does not have the badge, it might not be registered! Try submitting again!
 AzE#0001: Webgl doesn't work for unity. Just make sure to atleast upload a windows build
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: You have just over 20mins, submit your game!
 KevinOB#7686: 👍
 akaBl4ck#7384: man gamedevs are so positive
 Mrvica#8504: i am stupid like my game
 Taccos#1054: i uploaded but i dont see the "existing projects" dropdown
 Rareș#8101: hey guys the submission badge is not on my game page but my game is showing at the jam submissions page. is everything ok or should i reupload?
 Acu1000#5560: if you made a webgl build then try windows build instead
 GuyWithTime#7852: That was kinda slow ngl
 JuliusCube#8501: negative would actually be better than 1st, you know that right?
 Triggered#6897: Open page upload a zip(create a zip with all the files inside it)
If its for web make sure to rename main html file to index.html
 DevByMarc#7784: I don't think it was a bad thing, it just make the player play your game forever
 syelan34#3258: tbh I found that kinda fun bc it means that the scope has to be smaller so a single person can still do ok
 ◈・ Altaꐟ#9999: ohh i can submit my game in 23 mins but i just have a player controller and menu. what i need to do now ?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Second message up in 
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: if your game has the gmtk game jam 2022 badge you're all good
 quantum#0043: well nice idea
 redseiko#0001: last minute building and then trying to upload #yolo
 KevinOB#7686: Anyone else having issue trying to upload?
 USER#8646: Just to make sure again i do not need to resubmit the game to the jam right
 Mrvica#8504: 23
 JJfriends#3686: I feel like I have a small chance but def possible maybe top 100 for me?
 Acu1000#5560: You can always try making a game with previous jam's theme or your own idea
also I'd say this jam is pretty small because its just 48h
 Giel#6929: i couldnt get it done on time its my first so went overboard i was participating with a team
 GuyWithTime#7852: just say press alt+f4 to quit
 JuliusCube#8501: itch servers have gone down because of the gmtk game jam 3 times already
once in 2019  once in 2021, and also now.
 macleodian#7269: Next game jam theme: Please Read
 syelan34#3258: you can also look on the game jam page itself, under 'games' and 'my submissions'
 Mukhavertolet#2243: what would be the difference between practice jams and real jams?
 Tob#1798: same
 quantum#0043: bro i havent created an exit menu
 Mystery#7310: 20 mins left, goodluck to everyone get those games submitted! :D
 Ahat#0842: just an idea, there should be small game jams as sort of practice jams for the real thing, so people can practice making a game with a theme and in a time limit
 MrBen#0001: true
 Mrvica#8504: i am gonna be negative position
 Digitaldude555#5515: I DID IT I SUBMITTED. But....damn if I had a few more hours I could have had a game a lot better, the concept was good.
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: there is a tag for it
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: were you counting?
 Acu1000#5560: Well yes but everyone loves it
 GuyWithTime#7852: Its like a game for him where he tries to send the message as quickly as possible
 Giel#6929: Hi guys is there a way to search only for gmtk game jam stuff
 LOPSTERu#3902: dang you just came here to be negative lol
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Don't be like that 😛
 Tapu#9161: Second message has been said 54 times already
 Darn#2012: Ah sorry I didn't notice
 Okabe#4839: you mean as admin?

 Yoshi#0080: You have a screenshot handy? I believe I am looking at the desktop site, but I can’t seem to locate it.
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: If I place above 4000 I'm gonna be happy
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Just upload a .zip file with the python code - some people will be able to download and run it right
 MrBen#0001: I think u have it just copied and u paste it every time
 Taccos#1054:   pls im new to itch how do i submit the game (i already have the page with the game) sorry for ping
 softmagic#9999: wow the entries jumped from 3980 to 4300 in a few minutes

 SlamBamActionman#7160: Second message up in 
 MrBen#0001: I just realized that I have chances of getting into top 20 😊
 DarkKapla#9187: When you put the itch.io tag "dice" 😏
 Jhunter#4054: Anyone else having issues changing cover art and adding gifs on itch?
 SeanSS#0892: I like when you go to the jam page it screams at your face that you have no time left
 Peterino#3257: even better when you realize this CEO is John ritticello, the man who drove EA into the ground in the mid 00s
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: yep, looks that way
 macleodian#7269: I just realized all of my game jam submissions have been 3 word titles so far lol
 Hederlunden#3231: well congrats. , adding levels is probably a smart approach as you can always scale down the game, that's my strategy for game jams normally. but for this game jam i couldnt scale it down without breaking the game. but if i hadnt used such lazy code i probably wouldve finished tbh.
 Penguinmanereikel#3708: I made a puzzle game. Just a die navigating a top-down grid-based puzzle where switches and exits only work on certain die faces. But I realized don’t know how to make puzzle levels, so I had to ask someone to make them for me 😅
 ThatIsANoNoWord#5311: Everyone really does submit last minute
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: If anyone else is still working on their game, JUST BUILD IT YOU DON'T HAVE TIME
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: view desktop site, I don't think it shows on mobile
 Markositta#5352: one team member uploads it then he adds the other members as contributors
 akaBl4ck#7384: i really hope i get my webgl build done by then
 Ian Mykl#4218: Major preemptive shoutouts to whoever makes the top 0.5%
||And everyone else who managed to submit a game! You're amazing!||
 JuliusCube#8501: unity webgl?
go to player settings, then publishing settings, and then turn on decompression fallback. for some reason that sped things up immensely for me
 Digitaldude555#5515: if you are getting some error go to player settings and disable compression from brotil.
 JJfriends#3686: Guys just started my game!! Ready to finish in 20 mins!
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Only game page text and images, no game files, once the deadline is over
 Lunar#4998: ngl i'm kinda panicking rn
 Hobusu#5033: Good, that was the intent!
 Okabe#4839: Hi! How do you upload the game as a team?
 Bread#8231: 30 minutes!!!!! I am mostly done but very scared about game breaking bugs.....
 Tornado#0975: can we update game once i uploaded it before the deadline
 SlamBamActionman#7160: No clue, it probably won't work until the load lessens
 GuyWithTime#7852: That last sentence made me relax
 Mrvica#8504: 30 minutes
 AzE#0001: Web Builds in unity doesn't seem to work for me - there doesn't seem like there is any way to fix it. But I will keep you guys updated if I figure out something.
 quantum#0043: i cant
 macleodian#7269: *cue SpongeBobs scrambling gif*
 WorkingJoe#4433: My stuff builded but it turns out some of the most important things are invisible in the build for some reason \:((
 Yoshi#0080: Any idea if and where this banner is visible on mobile? I’m confident I submitted it correctly as I completed the survey hours ago but I’d like to be sure.
 Heromerom#0787: 30 min left?
 Ceding Tree#1081: May the build gods favor you 😄
 JuliusCube#8501: ive built and rebuilt my game like 40 times by now, and i finally feel like im done with my game
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Close everything else!!
 velvetlobster#4638: 30 MINUTES!!
 TommyUnreal#6446: Is there a way to fix it?
 Digitaldude555#5515: ITS STILL BUILDING SAVE ME
 AlpalcaLad#2549: poor everyone
 akaBl4ck#7384: nah he didn't ping anyone
 MrCatNerd#0669: oops
 dardasaba#9759: Yeah this xD
People literally can't read one message up
 Hobusu#5033: Submissions are due ! Remember that __there will be **no exceptions** for late submissions__, so make sure to get your game uploaded and submitted now—__don't worry about images and formatting for now__, you can fix that even after the deadline!
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: all you've done is ping a person called everyone
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: please don't try to @ everyone
 LemonScripts#5768: You can now upload images
 Tapu#9161: Power of Windows+V
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: Nah, just refreshing the submission feed and watching the chaos in here. I wish I brought popcorn
 Wally71551#5859: my heart goes out to all the people still directing people to the announcement about itch images
 Sappir#7051: xD your welcome

 Ceding Tree#1081: Yep, feel proud 😄
 MrCatNerd#0669: @everyone what did u make like i dont upload because i had only 2 hours
 sqrt#9237: CAN YOU FEEL THE BROKEN?
 Hobusu#5033: He has like five things on his clipboard I think, heh
 akaBl4ck#7384: if i update my game will it automatically update on gmtk too?
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: so...there where 21k people and im a survivor ?
 Ahat#0842: damn it, im sad i cant submit
 TheZaxvo#9305: anyone else just hitting refresh to see how many entries we get? lol
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: just half an hour huh? good luck to anyone still in the mire
 quackhacker#0972: The biggest issue imo with unity is the asset store. It is the largest collections of high-quality free resources for indie devs out there. Humble Bundle's partnership with them makes it a great resource for devs as well -- but perhaps Unreal will step up and help hand out resources too.
 NatyaCodes#8947: oh okay its there! thank you so much!
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: Yea. Im honestly kinda suprised i even submitted my game
i try to keep my scope smaller by, for instance, adding less levels in a platformer or something
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Second message up in 
 StormCodes#9924: I can't upload game images either

 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: omg guyz it's real 😳
 Taccos#1054: im submitting it now
 Digitaldude555#5515: unity is good, doesn't matter the game engine(unity, godot), the limit is usually your skill and time.
 NatyaCodes#8947: please help what do i do?
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: my plan for monetization: no
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Second message up in

 RedSantar#0027: someone else having problems uploading images in itchio?
 AzE#0001: my game kinda sucked this year - I had guest over at my house so I only got about 25% of the time that I would've got if they weren't here
 JanbluTheDerg#1018: I used the apha 12 for Godot 4 for this jam... Definitely looking forward to the full release, all in all, the alpha didn't give me too many problems...
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: 30minute left boi 😳
 Hederlunden#3231: thanks. yeah it feels really bad not submitting something you have been so stressed about and had so many headaches over, i normally dont finish 48 hour jams because i for some reason always do something new and i guess i overscope.
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: Its up to you, but Unity's Ceo said in an interview that everyone that doesnt think about monetization early in development is a "[freaking] idiot"
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: I don't see the issue with IronSource, it just looks like a monetisation thing they're adding?
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: 2nd message in  !
 Digitaldude555#5515: Just started building webgl will I make it in time. OH NO NO NO NO
 sqrt#9237: slowmode

 SlamBamActionman#7160: Second message up in 
 Osspial#0490: hey quick check you can change the description and all that jazz after the submission deadline, just not the game, right?
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: advantage of submitting early, not having to worry about itch dying
 AzE#0001: I can't upload screenshots and cover images
 Ceding Tree#1081: ouch 😦
 SparkerXof#3127: 30 minutes to build, recheck and upload the game. Is it a joke, Godot?
 JakJak#7212: all goods
 sqrt#9237: so what unity bad not use unity anymore ?
 sbubby#4885: one of the coders responsible for pathfinding 2 hours ago: "yeah the code is pretty bug free i think i can go now"
enemy pathfinding: *breaks*
 6746#9763: Consider Godot, its really good for 2D And Gets the job done for 3D. It Has some bugs here and there and you'll definitely encounter them but in the end, if you make 3d games and want to switch from unity, go to unreal, 2d, go to Godot.
 akaBl4ck#7384: YES WEBGL MODULE IS DOWNLOADING FAST SUDDENLY

 Chadian25#6541: Anyone else's new screenshots not loading on your page? Is Itch.io overloaded atm?
 LemonScripts#5768: Thank you so much! Litterally was about to quit
 Peewi#8572: I cut it real close, but I managed to submit a game. Time to see if I can't manage to make more levels in the next 30 minutes
 akaBl4ck#7384: i probably forgot to set my ui to scale with screen size
 Teslobo#8274: Looking up ironsource's history may answer this question
 Hederlunden#3231: well not really, i dont have time to submit the game, many bugs and a few things to add, and the code is a hellscape i dont want to enter. i just made the laziest decisions which made me get stuck on bugs for hours that really just involved changing a variable somewhere hidden. and everything is in 1 script
 trick0#7801: all done! Good luck everyone! Love this community ❤️
 jos3k4#6781: Anyone have the link to attach the game to the JAM? I already have my game on the site...
 RGBCube#8833: i somehow had enough time for an entire menu, tutorial, and second game mode lol
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: What is this ironsource merge thing that everyone hates?
 Casper#6361: Almost 4k entries
 Taccos#1054: i still got time left XD
 quackhacker#0972: ive thankfully gotten decent at making quick menu's but time and time again the UI scaling is bonkers lol
 akaBl4ck#7384: nah, unity sadly however i'm looking for new game engines after the ironsource merge
 Mukhavertolet#2243: there's like 2 objects moving at the same time. It looks like powerPoint for me. Can someone check if it's okay? I'll send ot to review channel
 Ceding Tree#1081: I'm just lucky the sound worked out! Put it off till the last minute, then recorded me rolling an eraser across my desk for the dice roll sound effect 😛
 theChief#0001: I didn't have time for a menu at all 
 6746#9763: Godot? Based.
 ItsYoBoiChad#1806: Ah, that does sound *wonderful* 👌  haha
 JakJak#7212: If you are using chrome it could be because Hardware Acceleration has been disabled in the chrome settings
 akaBl4ck#7384: my game's layout is a tragedy because navigating a scene in a laptop is a pain
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: Damn. Did it work out?
 Hugi Hugison#9165: or try to search by jams in progress.
 Casper#6361: Everything seems to be working
 Sappir#7051: Ehehe mines laggy too but i got like 50 objects moving  at all times and at least half of them uses rigidbodies
 quackhacker#0972: another jam another UI disaster lets go
 Ceding Tree#1081: Its more like a nightmare lol 😛 Everytime I went to add or change something I had to scroll through a wall of text
 Kamigaru#7468: Click on joined jams. It'll be there

 Jolly Ask#0856: waiting on that last build.......
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: I stayed up until around 3
 Ollimar#5924: Voting isn't up yet, but I guess it is ok to share your game itch.io URL already?  🤔
 jos3k4#6781: Images upload still not working, right? 😦
 Squigoul Headphony#9584: my team couldn't make it in the jam. it was my first time participating in a jam and my first time making a game in godot. Good luck to everyone else!
 Taccos#1054: im building the game!!!
 6746#9763: Server overload or something on Itch's end
 Tob#1798: I stayed up till 2 lastnight
 ItsYoBoiChad#1806: oh, everythings all in one script?? honestly that's impressive!
 AzCraft#4405: biggest challenge: compiling my game for windows.
 Hobusu#5033: Submissions are due ! Remember that __there will be **no exceptions** for late submissions__, so make sure to get your game uploaded and submitted now—__don't worry about images and formatting for now__, you can fix that even after the deadline!
 krisis in a jar#0904: holy shit, i'll manage to upload the updated windows build
 Hederlunden#3231: a kinda complex board game system with arrays, certain circles you land on do different things, you can steal, you can lie, you have a lot of small collectables, you have doors that only open if you have a certain amount of small collectables and oh wow now that i say it out loud

 Kamigaru#7468: I already like it
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: is this jam every year?
 Sappir#7051: In unity go to Edit -> Project settings -> Player -> Publishing Settings -> Compression format -> Disable
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Longer, due to all the folks here as the jam is reaching the deadline
 akaBl4ck#7384: i wish i didn't oversleep by like 5 hours today
 BadPiggy#5202: Fine tbh. I like my entry lol
Hopefully other people like it too

 Crusher48#2092: Well, my game's submitted and my last-minute "actually have animations" push came up flat so I'm just going to call what I've got what I've got, was still a solid project and I learned a few things that could help with other projects
 Jackcats0#4141: Same, but as long as It works I’m fine with it
 GreenData#2513: is it a unity project? if yes, then you have to disable compression.
 Sappir#7051: It's time to upgrade all my code and upload it to git
 ChipmunkDev#1808: This is really coming down to the last second for me... Grind time baby!
 6746#9763: I've been lucky to submit my game an hour before most other people lol, I had issues with the images too but now they're fixed for some reason
 Ian Mykl#4218: I actually intentionally designed my game from the start to make it work well with spaghetti code lol ~~wait is it  spaghetti code if your foundations where designed to work with it?~~
 Ceding Tree#1081: Hmmmmm......what is the error saying? I uploaded mine just fine
 akaBl4ck#7384: welp. i guess i won't be uploading a web build
 ItsYoBoiChad#1806: same, I am not happy with how my code looks. My old CS professors would hate to see my scripts haha
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Second message up in 
 BirdLogic#0828: Image upload is broken on Itch right now?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Second message up in 
 Hugi Hugison#9165: wow. after some despair with the last bugs i managed to submit.
 PlatosMan#2789: itch.io is refusing to upload images and screenshots rn. Are we allowed to update the cover photo and add screenshots after the deadline?
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: I was just reading through the jam page again, and I didn't realise people who didn't submit games can still vote. So many wasted opportunities over the years
 LemonScripts#5768: It gives me error when i try to run the web build
 Hederlunden#3231: yeah, it didnt work out very well, i mean it almost did, but the last few hours i just kinda duct taped the whole code hoping for it to work
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: wait what was the system for?
 Jackcats0#4141: I feel like as the jam went on my code got more and more spaghetti and brain became more and more mush
 Ceding Tree#1081: what problem?
 King Sol#2650: Thank you!
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Thought it was images
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Aoop
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Second message up in 
 SeanSS#0892: WELP everything is submitted, time to pop the champagne everybody
 Capybara#8868: key word try
 Ian Mykl#4218: spaghetti code is kind of the way to go for jams though
 LemonScripts#5768: Is the problem for web build itch.io or is it just me
 Zoro5168#0115: Game jam affecting world wide downloads
 Kapalaran#9174: same here
 akaBl4ck#7384: my download speeds are so slowwww
 Hederlunden#3231: next gamejam, im probably not gonna try to code a whole 1000 line spaghetti code system in 48 hours
 Professor Pickles#8498: yes
 Laugic ❄☃#0818: Thank you!
 SlamBamActionman#7160: .zip! 🙂
 SlamBamActionman#7160: You'll be able to update the images once they work again, and lots of people won't be playing games today anyways 😅
 King Sol#2650: When uploading to itch do I uploade a zip folder or my exe?
 Acu1000#5560: you aren't wrong
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: It literally says `YOU HAVE LESS THAN 50 MINUTES TO SUBMIT` on the itch page lol
 Augs#3262: I feel like as the jam goes on, everyone slowly loses their minds. Especially the mods of this server lol
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: And no images = no views = no plays, if you don't have an in-browser play ofc.
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Second message up in 
 Zoro5168#0115: Truly
 JamesB#0733: my game is broken it works in unity but not in the opengl
 RGBCube#8833: so it turns out i made a little mistake in the tutorial script
but because im running low on time and too lazy to fix it i'll just keep it as is
 akaBl4ck#7384: i'm currently on the road trying to install the unity webgl module on my laptop to update my game 👍
 Laugic ❄☃#0818: is anyone else having trouble uploading a cover image?
 leafar#2407: I guess I won't be uploading this year, but I found the foundation for me actually uploading my first game jam game later.
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: im so glad i submitted my game last night lol
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Literally everything I feared about this change summed up in one message, people are silly
 SparkerXof#3127: Which variant would be better? Upload game as embed or as archive?
 Mark Brown#6982: ooh! good idea, i'll make it bigger
 Markositta#5352: when will mark play the games in a livestream (if he will)?
 MangoWorks#1202: my game is done im just waiting now for the final piece of art
 ThatIsANoNoWord#5311: compression in project settings. disable it

 GuyWithTime#7852: oof
 LemonScripts#5768: Yes
 quantum#0043: i dunno my code isnt working
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Whoops i forgot images 🙂
 AzE#0001: yes
 SeanSS#0892: are the webgl stuff stuck on the loading for you guys too?
 SLiV#5820: I already know I'm going to get decimated by the voters because my game is way too complex 😅
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: Man, that feeling when you're actually done with everything, but can't go to bed because images don't upload.
 Mark Brown#6982: can't help some people
 Zoro5168#0115: Feeling sad for the people who thought the jam was 50hrs so are intending to submit till 52
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: its gonna start in like 45 minutes and i think the voting period's going to last a week
 Shotgun John#3854: My friend is manically trying to get sfml to work, I think C++ is somewhat difficult
 rafazcruz#5379: ahhh come on itchio fix ur servers
 Mark Brown#6982: one week's time!
 Alphons6#5054: yes Mark
 Acu1000#5560: When does the voting period end?
 JamesB#0733: umm
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: submit your game!
 quantum#0043: i dont know what to do ahhhh
 JuliusCube#8501: 1-3 was the 2 hours
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Yay I can't wait for timer to be up so I can play all the others 🙂
 Ahat#0842: lemme see what i can do for my game rn, maybe make it slightly playable
 Mark Brown#6982: Submit. Your. Game.
 LOPSTERu#3902: woah there has been like 1k entries in the past 40 minutes thats kinda crazy
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: You have 49mins!
 SparkerXof#3127: It is Godot's servers problem. My internet is fast enough.
 paulpork#7383: I would say made it enjoyable for most people.
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Once the timer is up, the time is up!
 Alphons6#5054: wait so 3 is final, no extra 2 hours to 5?
 Hobusu#5033: There are fewer than 50 minutes left to submit! Remember that __there will be **no exceptions** for late submissions__, so make sure to get your game uploaded and submitted now—__don't worry about images and formatting for now__, you can fix that even after the deadline!
 Zoro5168#0115: Where do i get it
 SlamBamActionman#7160: You should submit it lol
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Second message up in 
 Taccos#1054: adding post processing then building
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: final 50 minutes :00
 idroscimmia#6826: Guys I just sent my game, just me itch doesn't load some screenshots let alone the cover image?
 Cyber#0968: should I make my game too easy or too hard? I'm having trouble find a good balance
 Ahat#0842: my game only has the player, and some of the background
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: is this the part where I mention that Godot has a mobile build of the engine?
 paulpork#7383: Final version building
 mono#9151: I bet there are like a hundred different combinations of sokoban and dices.
 Hobusu#5033: You can leave that to the mods, but we appreciate the attempt to help!
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: Do you have slow internet? That might cause it.
 SparkerXof#3127: I hope uploading the game will be faster.
 Zoro5168#0115: Man i had been looking forward to this jam for 6 months.my pc just HAD to break now
 sqrt#9237: ITCH.IO IMAGE UPLOAD ISSUES:
There are some issues with itch.io and image files at the moment, especially noticeable with thumbnails. If you can't upload a thumbnail for your game now do not worry, you will be able to add a thumbnail  even after the voting period has begun as it's part of the game's itch.io page. They are aware of the issue!
 Hugi Hugison#9165: thanks a lot
 Snage#1337: 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏
 Cyklon_3000#6139: busy business because of us...
 Jakobe#0322: Oh god i think itch.io wont update
 YaBoiHammad#1204: honestly if you made a game in 48 hours you've already won
 RoyalNobody#9379: Thanks carrot 🙂
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: ever get bored of people not reading ?
 Redline#7370: itch has a casual 180ms ping right now lol
 Ceding Tree#1081: Congrats! Its a great feeling!
 SparkerXof#3127: 24 minutes to download them. Why is it so slow?
 Omegnight#7081: you can always submit this if you want feedback on this part
 HazyMajor#1406: First ever game jam, pretty chuffed that I saw it through and submitted!
 Zoro5168#0115: No
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Second message up in 
 Hugi Hugison#9165: so i am not the only one who cant upload images?
 Snage#1337: mmm yes "neatly" i say shoving the third gb of things into my "Everything" folder
 Ahat#0842: ill continue working on it after
 Spaceshark YT#4155: if it wasn't for github copilot, I almost certainly wouldn't have finished in time. Those code completion features are a lifesaver!
 krisis in a jar#0904: I hope the one by @/cookiecrayon wins, i really like the artstyle
 dewolen#8138: Unfortunately I wasn't able to finish my game, but at least I can upload a simple dungeon generator
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: quick, you still have time
 Marwan#9047: this image upload thing is annoying and its stressing me out :D
 Valkyrrii#3264: game: submitted. Now I'll see if I can throw music together before the time limit :p
 Roof#6985: What's important is that you finish your game, even if you don't submit!
 Ceding Tree#1081: I have a main folder too, but as I was making assets I just dropped them to the desktop lol. I only had 3 icons on the main screen at the start of the jam, now I'm at like 60 😛
 RGBCube#8833: bruh :/
 Snage#1337: my money's on the matching color row thing i saw in 
 SparkerXof#3127: Oh no, I forgot to install export templates for Godot...
 Zoro5168#0115: Sucks
 Redline#7370: or funny bloom game lol lmao rofl haha kekw kek
 Cunnah#9270: yeah I know, hence the stopping
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: nope, everything is neatly placed into folders
 krisis in a jar#0904: I would if i wans't so paranoic with my code being bad
 Acu1000#5560: not me because I know the ancient art of using a folder
 Ahat#0842: im unable to submit my game, its not finished. its due in part to a screen time limit on my laptop my parents put, and wont remove
 BadPiggy#5202: Either a random game with less rates and is high quality
Or some Uber popular game which is actually very good
 SmallGrains#5323: great!
 RGBCube#8833: anyone ever do `if condition: return true, else: return false` lol
or do you do `return condition`
 Ceding Tree#1081: who else has a SSSUUUUPPPPERR cluttered desktop now? 😛
 Snage#1337: dont sacrifice your health you still got next year m8
 Cunnah#9270: well can't fix this issue in time and I already feel very ill from the heat.
 krisis in a jar#0904: I'm really curious who will be the #1 game
 Mrinin#2181: YES, disabling compression from "gzip" to "disabled" solved it. file size only went up by like 1 mb so I don't think the compression is worth it anyways
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: yes, but just make sure you've got at least 1
 Redline#7370: or right, I actually need to make a page for my game, hmm
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Yup
 Ceding Tree#1081: Makes sense, I ran off a 2012 MacMini for about 6 years, only upgraded 2 years ago! It was a powerful machine, just getting a little dated now 😦
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: second message in  pal!
 SeanSS#0892: also another question: can you upload more files at this time if you've submitted? Seeing there's like an hour left
 macleodian#7269: Quick question, is it possible to have different methods of playing a game on the page? Like a browser build and a downloadable executable? Or do you have to pick one or the other
 SakarLord#3041: I cant upload cover photo for my game  on itch.io :/ anyone have same issue ?
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: might be worth getting the game up now, you have less than an hour!
 krisis in a jar#0904: I believe you marked the wrong person, still funny tho
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Go with what itch prefers, but as I understand it a .zip of your game is what's prefered
 Video Games Are Bad#6752: It definitely is! Especially in the timeframe that is 48 hours!
 MangoWorks#1202: My artist need to finish his art so i can export are game
 SmallGrains#5323: compression to gzip
 Spaceshark YT#4155: i have chrome open but thats it. My computer's a 2012 mac mini, so its pretty outdated. The only reason I use it over my much faster windows pc is that macos allows for ios exports
 Redline#7370: yea that's me! I'm bloom badabedabada
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: me: tries to make a 2nd build (webgl)
giant error: hey!
 Snage#1337: zamn thats 0-2 for me on jams m8, mayb next time.
 nightjar#6373: what about the option that we have to select with zip(executable?)
 RGBCube#8833: oh for sure!
releasing my first game is definitely something to be proud of lol
 Zoro5168#0115: Its the bloom guy!
 Mukhavertolet#2243: How are you all doing? What about your games?
 Teslobo#8274: yes
 jahn#0976: yeh mark definitely participated under the pen name boomheadshot69x420yolo
 Mrinin#2181: I'm googling it right now and it is telling me to turn off compression, so I'm trying that right now
 Tob#1798: I only have my game up for windows thats ok right?
 krisis in a jar#0904: I literally waited the whole year for this jam lol
 Teslobo#8274: yes
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Yup!
 Ceding Tree#1081: Thats rough! Are you doing something graphic intensive though? Like a high-res 3D game?
 Danny Dan Dan#6699: Okay, I got everything necessary working, I'm gonna submit this build and stop touching it more. This was really fun! I'm gonna work on this project more after the jam, maybe turn it into something resembling a game more 😆
 skejeton#5788: can we edit the page afterwards? itch.io refuses to work for some reason
 SmallGrains#5323: is the error when you build the game?
 anticarasosman#2765: omg my first game jam after following them for so much time.
 Acu1000#5560: I wonder if mark secretly participated in the jam
 quantum#0043: i literally havent completed it
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Zip! 🙂 With the .exe in it
 Redline#7370: building my updated/bugfixed edition thing
 Jellogramming#4653: just upload something. something is better than nothing
 nightjar#6373: hey guys when uploading can we just upload a zip file or do we have to upload an exe file of the game
 Spaceshark YT#4155: my computer freezes every 5 minutes with just unity open
 Zoro5168#0115: Hope
 Mukhavertolet#2243: Wooohooo, I submitted fully finished game!
 Shotgun John#3854: ok thanks
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Second message up in 
 YaBoiHammad#1204: 1 hour left, i aint gonna make it
 SeanSS#0892: guys is it just me or can't I not upload any images to the itch page?
 Video Games Are Bad#6752: Hope we all had fun and did stuff we were proud of!
 Ceding Tree#1081: I found out during this game jam that my computer can have open Unity, Photoshop, Logic Pro, and still do some light video editing without exploding 😛 sorry, didnt mean to reply
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: you can't lose, but you can definitely win
 krisis in a jar#0904: I did that because i couldn't compile my game to Windows with Linux, so i was searching for someone to do it for a long time
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: final hour :0
 sqrt#9237: guys  have i ever told you that i want to become a boxer
 Fehl#7244: Should we be able to search for our game once in itch? or does it take a while?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Self-Care is getting nerfed in the next patch. Not looking forward to all the newbies standing in a corner of the map and self-healing for like 57 seconds instead of doing generators :/
 Pydude#7379: me: waiting years for pyinstaller to convert file into a exe
 Wally71551#5859: got the game uploaded just praying i can get some confirmation on the cover being uploaded and then im gonna submit our game 👍
 mindlessly#8187: just to clarify if one of us submit and I am put as contributor and admin does it know that it is a submission for 2 people
 HerrCron#5856: I am so bloody tired. Also using UE5 was a _choice_
 Jellogramming#4653: you can't lose in a game jam, you always get better at game dev after one
 Hobusu#5033: Second message from the bottom in 
 jahn#0976: don't do that. it catches up to you and dooms you in the end. self-care first, jam second. that's important. eat, hydrate, sleep, take care of yourself.
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: 3 minutes->62 entries
 Tapu#9161: Day 4 of GMTK jam
 krisis in a jar#0904: This should be the jam's main theme
 Shotgun John#3854: Anyone else experiencing issues uploading images to the website?
 Nobody6502#8971: I'd also be very interested to see what sort of game you would have made for this theme 👀
 YaBoiHammad#1204: guys u cant lose if you dont join...just sayin
 Ian Mykl#4218: After a very long and rocky history this first time completing a weekend gamejam 🥳
 Hobusu#5033: Only one hour left to submit! Remember that __there will be **no exceptions** for late submissions__, so make sure to get your game uploaded and submitted now—don't worry about images and formatting, you can fix that even after the deadline!
 SlamBamActionman#7160: If it says something to that effect it's in 😛
 Mark Brown#6982: how many people click your link when they see it
 BlankSlate#8922: Same
 paulhdh#6428: finished at around 12:30 rn trying to upload gifs and images
 MetalGearSamus#0001: literally just hit the save button on the page, then re-load and you can change that option
 Mrinin#2181: it is giving me an error in the web build but not on windows build. I guess it is fine but I'd really like to have a web build
 Mark Brown#6982: ONE HOUR LEFT
 mbrlabs#4351: this jam brings itch.io to it's knees...can't upload screenshoits. I get 504 timeout errors all the time
 Ceding Tree#1081: should it say submitted or submission?
 MrBen#0001: what does that mean?
 Pydude#7379: the miracle just happend: cover image loaded.
 RGBCube#8833: funny thing about my game
i had an entirely different gameplay style in mind
ig time restraints or laziness contributed to that other style not happening lol
 voithos#0258: Is anyone else getting the "Loading game for the first time" message on itch for a while? (For the HTML5 export)
I assume it's just because their servers are slammed?
 Jeremy K#8576: my images finished uploading to my itch.io page... theres still hope!
 jahn#0976: next time around i'll actually be here in the channel DURING the jam lol, looking forward to it. 🙂
 krisis in a jar#0904: No, i was literally coding with no sleep until now
 GuyWithTime#7852: I gotta say it feels good having uploaded the game
Im pretty happy with it!
 Jackcats0#4141: Nearly one hour left I’m excited
 Marwan#9047: thank youu
 Fishy_F1shy#5274: Fair enough, looking forward to it!
 Professor Pickles#8498: im stoked we're finished
 LemonScripts#5768: Save doesnt work either
 anticarasosman#2765: help sorry i was following the drive for uploading my game but when i wanted to put "public" it said that i needed to save first, i saved but got send to another screen, what do i do?
 TheMikeDaoust#7314: GG everyone hope you all had fun!
 Mark Brown#6982: depends on context
 GreenData#2513: it has the badge, thanks.
 Mark Brown#6982: or crash team racing
 Kyo Ricardo#4586: How are you programming so hard that your hand hurts?
Do you have like carpel tunnel or something? 👀
 Mark Brown#6982: click through rate
 MrBen#0001: what is CTR btw?
 Mark Brown#6982: I'll answer questions like this after the jam ends, bit manic right now 😄
 Ceding Tree#1081: I had no sound or music until like 2 hours ago. I rolled an eraser across my desk for the dice roll sound effect and it worked really well actually 😛
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Second message up in 
 TimFW#9241: A little tip for all people who are just as confused as I am:
If you want both an embedded version and a downloadable version of you game, make sure that the .zip files do not have the same name, otherwise they'll just replace one another.
Very obvious unless you're stressed. I lost a few hairs over this.
 Madness#5032: Cover image on itch.io doesn't load?
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Check  for upload issues! we're aware of them!
 jahn#0976: absolutely! the whole point of game jams is to break you out of your comfort zone, right? if you're 100% prepared, you're not doing it right imo 😉
 Mark Brown#6982: yep, you can submit multiple games. but to make sure, check if "Submission to GMTK Game Jam 2022" is on your game's itch.io page
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Second message up in 
 Tob#1798: just barely got by, not proud of my game sadly
 YaBoiHammad#1204: im not sure if im gonna be able to finish the last levels of my game in time, does anyone have any advice?
 Marwan#9047: hey, anyone having trouble uploading on itch rn?
 SmallGrains#5323: errors or you have already built the game?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Yup. Make sure your game page has the "Submitted to GMTK Game Jam 2022" badge in the top right!
 OrangoMango#0973: lol
 Fishy_F1shy#5274: Mark I'm curious. Assuming you picked the theme, what made you pick "Roll of the Dice" over any other options?
 krisis in a jar#0904: fun fact: my hand still hurts from coding
 Ceding Tree#1081: 🤣
 Capybara#8868: on a side note what actually happens during the selection of the theme every year?
 Mrinin#2181: oh god web build is not compiling
 Tapu#9161: Wait can't you update that stuff during jam?
 GreenData#2513: is it normal that it shows "submit your project" after submitting it?
 Lehoux#3697: Mark and the mods on Heavy Ctrl+V duty
 anticarasosman#2765: help sorry i was following the drive for uploading my game but when i wanted to put "public" it said that i needed to save first, i saved but got send to another screen, what do i do?
 stuin#0747: Welp, the windows build of my game is completely broken, even though it works fine in wine and in linux. I thought I solved this problem last year.
 Mark Brown#6982: ah, win some lose some
 vide0gamer#5404: i couldnt get what i wanted in but its still a game so ill still submit
 Jellogramming#4653: you can anytime
 Professor Pickles#8498: wooohooo
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Second message up in 
 Mark Brown#6982: a week!
 MrBen#0001: wow im so proud of my game
 snares#8483: is anyone else having issues uploading pictures to itch.io
 jahn#0976: anyone feeling discouraged about not completing, please do know i'm a bit of a game jam vet. been doing these for 10 years. i did not meet the deadline. software dev always has a curveball around every corner. 🙂
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: the jam is not over, you have one hour-ish to submit your game NOW!
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: yo SamAlexandros here hi nono!
 SmallGrains#5323: its 2 am where I am at, how long will we be able to change cover images and screenshots for?
 krisis in a jar#0904: "You did it?"
"Yes."
"But at what cost?"
 Cyndaquil#2646: Are you challenging me?!
 Hederlunden#3231: Well I don't normally give up, but continuing now would be worthless. But now I got a cool profile picture and I will probably implement this game into the game im working on, it would actually fit pretty well
 Ceding Tree#1081: Challenge accepted 😛
 Random Guy#5920: Is jam ended???
 The Mayday Man#8467: 1h left! submit submit submit!!!!!!!!!
 NotExplosive#0002: I was making a timelapse where I took an in-engine screenshot of my game every time you launch the game (creates a really cool timelapse, I've done it for a lot of past games).
... but then I ran `git clean` to fix a build bug and deleted my screenshots folder 😦
 FryDev#0372: all of you better watch out for me next year
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: What is this Iron Source unity stuff?
 Mark Brown#6982: Itch.io is currently having issues uploading images. Please try again later - you will be able to upload cover art, screenshots etc even after the deadline ends!
 Lehoux#3697: Film the hearthbreak, then film the comeback
 Pydude#7379: Does anyone have issues with cover image?
 Mark Brown#6982: Itch.io is currently having issues uploading images. Please try again later - you will be able to upload cover art, screenshots etc even after the deadline ends!
 SmallGrains#5323: I also have this issue
 RGBCube#8833: how many people have open sourced their submission?
 Mark Brown#6982: my sanity?
 Jellogramming#4653: this was probably the most fun I've had in a game jam, thank you mark
 Mark Brown#6982: act two: they take what they learned from failure, try Ludum Dare, WIN THE GRAND PRIZE, become game design legends
 Spaceshark YT#4155: lost time and energy
 terrysaw#9401: This was my first Game Jam, too. Thanks for hosting it, Mark et al. My game didn't turn out amazing, but I was in a total rut before where I didn't feel creative or able to make anything. This has really rejuvenated my love of game dev. Thanks so much again!
 krisis in a jar#0904: Does it cost anything to make the jam?
 Ceding Tree#1081: I would imagine there is at least one out there lol
 Mark Brown#6982: that's still a story!
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Second message up in 
 BadPiggy#5202: Yo

 no_ones#4897: hey....changing jam page...like description and screen shots.....and decorating after submission time is allowed right?
 jahn#0976: godot has its quirks, but it's actually really good. it's opinionated so don't fight it. if something doesn't work, rethink it. i was trying to use CSV files to store card data and struggled with getting them to package with the game. turns out, i needed to write a custom Resource.
 Joel Rochon#4139: Thank yuo Mark! We had a lot of fun 🙂
 OrangoMango#0973: I need someone who can test my game if it actually works. please dm me

 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: my web build had bee.exe errors... Seems like somebody did in on porpuse so we small devs will lose 👀
 Minus#1843: Yeah, just Unity being a mess is normal it seems..... Good thing we're dropping this engine after last news from Unity 🙃
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: lol itch.io 's recent games tab is just flooded with dice, every time i reload
 Worio#6432: Hey guys would anyone be able to direct me in submitting the game? this is my first jam .___.

 NotExplosive#0002: ..... brb

 Tapu#9161: You could make an entire game in that time ||i wouldn't suggest doing it||
 tomster12#7972: do most people not just upload a super early draft to get a submission then update it as they go?
 Pydude#7379: nah my game file is huge, but I am tired and don´t have time to fix.
 Jellogramming#4653: is itch.io suppose to still say "submit your project" even after you've submitted it
 infernoNoodles#8206: itch io is supper laggy or it is just my pc?

 Hobusu#5033: ~~Their size now matches their importance~~
 Mark Brown#6982: that was intentional (though i changed it back because people got mad)
 akaBl4ck#7384: im a bit sad that the webgl module isn't downloading
 NotExplosive#0002: looked like that for me until just now when I refreshed
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Ah fuck we are so close to hitting 22k! That'll be a new record!!!
 krisis in a jar#0904: Does the GMTK jam happen at the same time every year?
 Tob#1798: bro why is mr. nice dice 265 mb lol

 Kyo Ricardo#4586: 😝 Roll a dice to see which game you should play

 Diguifi#0725: **only** random games i guess

 Hobusu#5033: That part I don't believe is true, some of the Helpers participated but I don't think any of the full mods did
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Itch is not dying, uploads are just having trouble- upload your game, worry about presentation later!
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Oh lol no
But Lawn and theChief did!

 Cameron#7818: itch.io seems to be distributing their compute properly.
This is a good thing.

 Scolon#4218: I'll be back when submissions are closed to play some games
 petrak＠#9412: hello, is it cheating to post a link to my game on my twitter/discord server?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: I am knitting, I'm fine
 Mark Brown#6982: Nothing to announce currently - right now I'm pleased to keep the jam 100% independent
 M_Raven#4076: I love how you said this and then Fearal actually did it, and then people actually started asking if the jam was legit over
 LurkerRIP#8971: Thanks!
 BrokenCalculator#2386: i wonder how tired you are of saying that
 ThatIsANoNoWord#5311: Is the big red warning on the jam screen unique to this jam only or is this something I've never heard about?
 Vii13#1424: Let's hope slam doesn't give up then. It'd be sad to end such a nice yearly event.

 Omniclause#4760: **ITCH.IO IMAGE UPLOAD ISSUES:**
There are some issues with itch.io and image files at the moment, especially noticeable with thumbnails. If you can't upload a thumbnail for your game now do not worry, you will be able to add a thumbnail  even after the voting period has begun as it's part of the game's itch.io page. They are aware of the issue!
 The Mayday Man#8467: the jam is over!!
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: the jam is over. please have a mental breakdown
 Diguifi#0725: yes
 LurkerRIP#8971: Anyone else having issues uploading the thumbnail?
 Kyo Ricardo#4586: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 akaBl4ck#7384: mods should just say the jam is over and make people have mental breakdowns
 Ceding Tree#1081: Congrats, welcome to the Club!
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: Oh. I heard someone had a team with 11 people here, but damn
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: Submited and finished. YAY!
 9bitmax#3119: i finsh my game now. i need publish on itich.io
 Teslobo#8274: Non-contributors will need to go through a random queue of games. Add your team as contributors to let them choose which games to play/rate
 Tojo#3216: good luck to all of the entrants!
 krisis in a jar#0904: Guess the jam will never end then
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: I like to make tailor-made bespoke posts **firmly** reminding people to check  , slam shovels cheap copy/paste jobs out of a production line
 Acu1000#5560: that's 100% a joke
 Markositta#5352: 🤓
 Zoro5168#0115: Idk i heard it in this very chat 2 days ago
 Mark Brown#6982: the day slam says he can't do the jam anymore is the day gmtk game jam ends

Game makers: 🤓
Game players: 😎
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Well Hobusu has been pretty high with the time warning so
 Ceding Tree#1081: with a 6 hour cooldown to post, so make sure you get it right lol
 RGBCube#8833: imagine i left in some debug feature in the final jam build lol
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: which studio?
 Hobusu#5033: Absolutely slam
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: it was 100% slam
 Mark Brown#6982: definitely slam
 krisis in a jar#0904: Can someone count which mods posted the warning most times?
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: again, please keep all review requests to  !
 akaBl4ck#7384: i'm so glad i uploaded my game before all the server issues
 Mark Brown#6982: you can rate all games on itch - that's different to voting on them as part of the jam
 holya#6847: im interested how many people everyone have in their teams? we were making a game with 4 people ^^
 Hobusu#5033: Those ratings are separate from the Jam votes, I believe
 Omniclause#4760: Haha damnit
 Kyo Ricardo#4586: r/place for game dev? yikes
 NoFace#5304: last call If you entered the gmtk gj, dm me your game link so I can play it.
How are people able to rate games before the submissions have closed..?
 Mark Brown#6982: s'okay, i know it's a stressful time this close to the deadline!
 Zoro5168#0115: Im not lying
 MetalGearSamus#0001: Well, I have some good news. My screenshots DID upload successfully.
 Kavindu#5396: oh thanks
 StormyRise#2632: Thanks .. and sorry 😅

 Ceding Tree#1081: out of about 2k submissions, id say you have rougly a 50% chance lol
 gamedevperson#8448: the mods after posting the same link 1M times:
 Relis#1309: with so many submissions how can one hope to get some visibility? I mean i feel like no one will even see my page 😂  which is fine i had fun doing it and that's what matter, but still
 Acu1000#5560: r/woooosh
 Jellogramming#4653: we need a bot that replys to any message saying "itch.io images are broken" with "#please-read"
 Cyndaquil#2646: Imagine a game jam were everyone decides to team up🤔
 Markositta#5352: 😎
 Omniclause#4760: Wait that’s actually pretty cool. What is their game?
 Spaceshark YT#4155: I'm just hoping my game gets top 1000
 Teslobo#8274: You don't even need to join the jam. Everyone will have the power to rate submissions
 Kyo Ricardo#4586: 😎 ah okay cause I made a game with 10 people ||(all imaginary)||
 krisis in a jar#0904: i'd say it's worth it lol
 Zoro5168#0115: Thats how it gets fair i think cuz managing that amount in 48 hrs gets real hard
 MetalGearSamus#0001: V_V
 Hobusu#5033: Yes, that's what the second message from the bottom in  addresses
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Yeah that's what the message says
 Kavindu#5396: No i meant cant upload a cover image to itch.io..... it keeps loading and loading
 Itooh#5008: After much hesitations, I decided to put the line _“Bounce pad!”_ into my game. (it has bounce pads)
 uturn#2245: What steps - if any - need to be taken for team members to be able to play and rate jam submissions?  Do they need to be credited somehow on the upload, or do they just need to join the jam?
 Ceding Tree#1081: i mean, what is fair? isnt the point to grow as a developer?
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Second message up in 
 Mark Brown#6982: 
 Fusoy#6101: How is that possible to manage 200 people in 48 hours ??
 Omniclause#4760: I was thinking about that earlier. Like would it be worth it for them to get more servers or not, because this happens literally once year for a small window. Might not really be worth it unless other jams start getting this big
 Random Guy#5920: Did u guys all submitted your games?
 Kyo Ricardo#4586: Damn so I guess I can't include the last 753 million people on the planet 😔
 akaBl4ck#7384: imagine epic games joined the jam 🤣

 Zoro5168#0115: A triple A studio joined with 200 members
 CALSYTHE#6648: so I suppose Itch's servers are... JAMMED?
 Ceding Tree#1081: 7 billion
 Jellogramming#4653: this jam is going pretty good, the ratio of jammers to games is 7:1
 sushiman#4823: when does the games are selected by mark

 gamedevperson#8448: webgl takes so long
 Acu1000#5560: Doesn't it pick the least played submissions first though?
 RGBCube#8833: did my screen resolution shrink or did the font size on the number of jammers and the number of submissions increase?
its a bit big on my screen
 9bitmax#3119: i am trying to add a highscore
 King Sol#2650: I cancelled my build it was taking over 30 minutes building WebGL but my Standalone built in 10 seconds lol

 Jeremy K#8576: ^^
 Jellogramming#4653: do it ASAP and submit it, something is better than nothing
 rafazcruz#5379: How are they going to judge the games?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Second message up in 
 Ceding Tree#1081: cant upload another cover picture...... 😦
 Omniclause#4760: Do whatever you can to make your page as appealing as possible. Good thumbnail is most important and try to have at least one gif and 2 or 3 screenshots
 gamedevperson#8448: 6K (i think at least)
 FryDev#0372: have an appealing thumbnail and title
 RGBCube#8833: you know how the theme is
**the dice roll of the itch.io "random submission" button will decide which submissions get noticed and which are left in the dark**
 Acu1000#5560: If vast majority was made during the jam then yes, otherwise no
 Augs#3262: we crashed it?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Well that's the rub; is *most* of the art custom, or just a bit?
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: 5000-ish I think?
 Markositta#5352: luck i would think

 hatoving#4710: question, if i have both pre-existing art and custom art in the game, what do I select for "did you team create most of the art"?
 krisis in a jar#0904: Guys, there are cockroaches in the itch.io servers that's why we are having problems
 NotExplosive#0002: yes, you cannot upload new builds tho
 Bread#8231: we can still edit the itch page after the deadline right?
 Danny Dan Dan#6699: I just submitted mine, maybe it was number 3000 lol
 RGBCube#8833: yoo
 Spaceshark YT#4155: With over 3000 entries, how are people supposed to discover your game in the horde of submissions?
 BadPiggy#5202: Fr.
People seriously take itch io for granted
And mind you their using their own custom made web framework. Oof
 Gabriel Bigardi#2292: congrats to everyone who joined the jam
 Tapu#9161: Last hour was hectic, made art like a madman
 Mark Brown#6982: We just passed **3000** games

 SlamBamActionman#7160: For any itch.io engineer in this chat: You are real champs and we love you ❤️ It's just a fun meme that the jam causes you issues, but truly you are great
 Xe1a#6595: Is there going to be another livestream of mark playing random games this year?
 Lanyard#0466: anybody else unable to upload a Splash Image? Should I just accept it for now?

 ThatIsANoNoWord#5311: Waiting for an hour and a half so I can see other people's submissions
 Vabenil#5485: That sounds fun
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: Maybe
 Zoro5168#0115: Quite funny tbh
 Mark Brown#6982: luckily, right now, it's just a flesh wound
 hatoving#4710: i gotta say, for this being my first successful jam ever, this was a lot of fun lol
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: **Make sure you have submitted your game to the jam and not only uploaded it to itch**
Cheat sheet about launching a game on itch but also super importantly the last step of adding the game to the game jam
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Yup
 gamedevperson#8448: itch.io gonna crash easily
 NotExplosive#0002: very yes
 softmagic#9999: did we break itch again?
 krisis in a jar#0904: Every 5 minutes someone asks that lmao
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Second message up in 
 SlamBamActionman#7160: I am the reason for the current heat wave
 Mark Brown#6982: **ITCH.IO IMAGE UPLOAD ISSUES:** There are some issues with itch.io and image files at the moment, especially noticeable with thumbnails. If you can't upload a thumbnail for your game now do not worry, you will be able to add a thumbnail (or other things like screenshots) even after the voting period has begun as it's part of the game's itch.io page. They are aware of the issue!
 Markositta#5352: they are BI
Biological Intelligence
 Acu1000#5560: You're screaming irl right now as your brain's temperature slowly raises to 180 C
 JMCQ#8619: is itch down. Trying to get the images and itch page together and looking good
 Mark Brown#6982: either PC or WebGL - though you can also do other versions if you like
 akaBl4ck#7384: i'm trying to download the webgl module but my internet is slow
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: Are the image servers back up yet?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: AI =/= Bots
 NoFace#5304: I literally stream 8-12 hrs from now
 Omniclause#4760: Last years was my first. The first one I did after that was lowrezjam and I had a blast. It limits you to a 64by64 resolution. It was smaller I think around 600 participants and I think it ended up being a little under 200 games. Also it’s 10 days if I remember correctly so you can flesh out your game alot more
 Zoro5168#0115: U said u werent ai
 anticarasosman#2765: when im exporting a game do i need to do it for pc, mac, linux or for WebGL?
 Jellogramming#4653: this year's theme was cool, it allows for so much creativity
 Teslobo#8274: If we had to wait the message timer we'd have to resort to banning people without being able to explain what was wrong
 SlamBamActionman#7160: This is true, because as Debug.Log messages usually are, they won't show to any other than the application
 softmagic#9999: alright, i added a last-minute tutorial to my game
 Acu1000#5560: >SlamBamActionMan.ExecuteScript while(true){Debug.Log("AAAAA")}
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Power
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: the mods are immune to time out, the patrons are not
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Muahaha
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: see?
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: nope
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Nope
 SlamBamActionman#7160: 
 Zoro5168#0115: Please read 
 krisis in a jar#0904: Do mods also have to wait the message timer? (oops, didn't mean to mention you)
 BadPiggy#5202: Not yet
 OrangoMango#0973: I need to test my build where do I ask?
 tummai#2442: We (2-man team) submitted our game!  This is our second time to participate in gmtkjam.  Really had fun with it.

 Tapu#9161: submitted my build and it was hella rushed
 Toboter#5206: Is it Unity? check the sprite layer
 ThatIsANoNoWord#5311: The theme was interesting. Perhaps it could be simplified to "dice" only but it still allows for some room for creativity
 Kyo Ricardo#4586: What was last years theme?
 Vabenil#5485: This was my first game jam, any recommendations for any other game jams out there? (If that's allowed)
 akaBl4ck#7384: i wanted to make my last level dicing onions
 IamHaPPy#2536: the servers are working very nice nothing is out of the ordinary in the last 2 hours of the jam
 Jellogramming#4653:

 Markositta#5352: genius 🧠
 Hobusu#5033: We did last year, most of the features we cared about are now built into Discord so we got rid of it
 FryDev#0372: the theme was a little bit too restrictive this year imo, but still a lot of great ideas
 SlamBamActionman#7160: It's us, we are the bots
 Toboter#5206: Y'all really need one of those "automaticly send an answer with a single command bots", do ya?
 Kyo Ricardo#4586: 😎 Time to troll myself by never submitting my game
 akaBl4ck#7384: ngl i didn't like this year's theme
 AZOTh the Creator#7094: 2023 game jam theme must be: goldfish
 krisis in a jar#0904: *Mark trying to maintain his composture*
 PokeNinjaGuy#9592: anyone know if mark plans to do livestreams playing submitted games like last year?
 Acu1000#5560: did I just see mark drop the f-bomb
 NotExplosive#0002: yes, try again later (you can upload screenshots after submission)
 Spaceshark YT#4155: My favorite part about game jams is when you spend the entire first day trying to make this epic feature only to realize that you spent way too much time on it and it didn't even end up working, so you have to scrap it.
 NoFace#5304: If you entered the gmtk gj, dm me your game link so I can play it.
 meelooteen#4180: Amazing job, guys! This was my first game jam ever, and what a great experience!
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: apparently we need to put credit in our game page
 akaBl4ck#7384: a friend of mine is having issues with uploading
 Xe1a#6595: Oooooo 2 of my 3 screenshots just loaded :0
 krisis in a jar#0904: I used zip (did the message delay become longer?)

 Toboter#5206: Imagine having to download a Unity game file by file...
 Tyflon#3487: I uploaded images fine with Microsoft Edge  (A small price to pay for salvation)

 SlamBamActionman#7160: Zip! 🙂
 NotExplosive#0002: zip, one zip per platform (ie: one zip for windows, one for mac, etc)
if just windows then just one zip
 MetalGearSamus#0001: Do I look like I know what a jpeg is????
 Augs#3262: Should I use a zip file? or individual files? For submitting my game
 krisis in a jar#0904: 1 hour and 30 minutes left!
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: **CHECK**  **FOR INFORMATION ABOUT IMAGE UPLOADING YOU GOLDFISH BRAINED GOONS**

 JanbluTheDerg#1018: I submitted! I pray it works, I uhhhh, decided to use the Godot 4 alpha and since I can't test the other builds *y'all are stuck with windows*
 Acu1000#5560: was anyone at all able to upload an image or is it 100% broken
 Xe1a#6595: Definetly one of the better games I've made for these, it's incredible what more experience will do
 Hamilton#0526: So let it be written, so let it be done.
 Relis#1309: can't believe i did it in time lol. Wanted to add some more levels but working solo is slow and hard damn. good luck guys, i've seen so many great stuff in the progress channel

 Jellogramming#4653: if you cannot screenshot the jam page for your game, you got some work to do
 Xe1a#6595: Sacraficies sometimes need to be made
 King Sol#2650: I think they escaped
 krisis in a jar#0904: *The bad ending*
 gamedevperson#8448: i published my game, now, slepp
 Markositta#5352: itch gonna explode
 Paytonio#5712: I mean I could have set an alarm but the walls are thin in this house so it'd wake everybody else up too

 Acu1000#5560: discord gets locked to light mode for the rest of your life
 krisis in a jar#0904: That just makes it more terrifying!
 Mark Brown#6982: Yep! You can keep updating until the final deadline
 King Sol#2650: I haven't don't a build of a game in a couple of years and I forgot how to make it go quickly. 15 minutes still building. Sad.

 Thefearalcarrot#5679: you don't want to know
 Mark Brown#6982: makes it better

 Armis#1201: hey! anyone having problem to upload thumb for the project on itch io ??
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Gamejam 🙂
 Teslobo#8274: good job
 Hamilton#0526: So I added a cover image, but it's not showing in the Submissions list. Tips?
 RGBCube#8833: 100% of 0 is 0, therefore you made a vast majority of the music during the jam
 Sappir#7051: What should I put for my viewport dimensions?

 AlpalcaLad#2549: you did make a majority of the music
 AlexBR#3963: One question: if I didn't put any music in my game, how do I answer the music question in the submission?
 FryDev#0372: yup, doesn't work
 Hobusu#5033: Correct, only editing the game itself is locked during voting
 Mark Brown#6982: Yep!

 Space#0859: Ima cheat a lil👁️👄👁️
 Omniclause#4760: Congrats on finishing!
 Yolwoocle#6689: I'm sorry, I was busy desperately exporting and uploading my game 😅
 Teslobo#8274: You can continue to edit the page, just not the game itself
 Mark Brown#6982: yep!
 Mark Brown#6982: doesn't matter!
 krisis in a jar#0904: The artstyle of the game by @/cookiecrayon is really nice
 AbdouPlay#1545: "I made the music"
 akaBl4ck#7384: i'm so happy rn i literally did nothing the first day except movement and now i'm done!!!
i also included sound effects and music made by myself so i'm happy with that too
 Woum#5790: We can even edit the description/image after thedeadline right?
 Xe1a#6595: If there's no audio, do I say that I made the music or I used pre-existing audio?
 Space#0859: Oh, 💀... Ima upload the last hour
 Omniclause#4760: I’d say about 1 in every 3 comments for the past hour has been about it. Seems like it’s gonna be down til after submission period

 Mark Brown#6982: better to be early!
 Sappir#7051: I gave up on making a menu, i just focused on gameplay
 Wompfbeere#0090: is it ok to upload a tiny browser game as a full executable? because my controls don't work in webGL, but in the normal windows build :/
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: eyy snap

 LOPSTERu#3902: Yeah for now there are 2.6k entries (increasing)
 AbdouPlay#1545: Ah yes
Sorry
 nicompany#4718: relax
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: thats the amount of participants. there around 2.5K submisssions already
 SlamBamActionman#7160: 5.7k
 Gisleburt#3004: But if the game is already submitted?
 NoFace#5304: Me rate entries live 8-12 hours from now, dm me game links to get rated.
 Beeg scarf#3571: how many submissions were last year
 Sappir#7051: I think its pretty close...
 Noxim#6410: I should start making my game 🤔
 Mark Brown#6982: there are no late submissions. if you don't submit during the jam then you're not in the jam and you can do whatever you like with your game... because it's not in the jam! 😛
 Scolon#4218: ok I'm gonna get one more update to my game out
 Roiboi#2055: isn't that the amount that joined..?

 Roiboi#2055: how many submissions are there right now
 gamedevperson#8448: maybe i will submit in another 2 years, no harm
 Sappir#7051: it takes me 15 minutes to build my game orz
 Gisleburt#3004: What happens if you upload after the two hours? My assumption is later uploads won't be part of the jam, but you can still work on your game in general. (Hopefully you're not penalised)
 Jellogramming#4653: hmm maybe I should submit my game (jk already submitted)
 Hobusu#5033: ~~The real Jam theme is "just submit something before the deadline, pls"~~

 Thefearalcarrot#5679: don't be weird to mark plz
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: i really wish we can send images to this channel so i can describe itch.io"s servers rn
 krisis in a jar#0904: Yep, i'm on linux using the web engine for mac, it might have some glitches on mac tho
 kylejramstad#0205: I submitted my game but when I see it in the submissions area, it doesn't show its picture unless you click on it and open its page. Is that going to cause my game to be under rated?
 velvetlobster#4638: everytime I refresh the jam page I see like +50 new entries
 Hobusu#5033: Remember that __there will be **no exceptions** for late submissions__, so please use the remaining time until  only to make sure that your game has been submitted successfully (and for updating your game after you've submitted it)!
 akaBl4ck#7384: i'm so happy
 Taccos#1054: im done with all the levels, now i just gotta add a death screen and i can submit

 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yeah voting for the jam only opens when the submissions close
 Vabenil#5485: How do I find this game jam games to rate them again?
 OrangoMango#0973: I don't have a windows pc, how can I be sure that my windows build works? help please
 krisis in a jar#0904: There's going to be a lot of puns involving dice

 Wompfbeere#0090: same problem here 😬
my controls don't work in webGL, but in the editor and the .exe version 😭
 Avelore | Bloomzeye (They/Them)#3394: For those with teams: btw be sure to add your members as authors so the game shows up on their itch io page also!

 SLiV#5820: That's it, step away from your editors!
 Mark Brown#6982: Relax. Have a bubble bath.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: **Make sure you have submitted your game to the jam and not only uploaded it to itch**
Cheat sheet about launching a game on itch but also super importantly the last step of adding the game to the game jam
 Mark Brown#6982: Yep! You should have received an email with all the details!
 Omniclause#4760: Kind of an honor system thing but the extra 2 hours is specifically for submissions in case there is crashing stuff. It’s kind of against the spirit of the jam to continue working on it.
 Ceding Tree#1081: guys....I.....I did it! I sumbited my final build of the game, and now I can like......stop? how to stop.........?
 sqrt#9237: mark

 Mark Brown#6982: It's been 48 hours but there's still 2 hours left on the clock, so use this time to SUBMIT, BUG FIX, and MAKE SURE YOUR GAME IS ACTUALLY IN THE JAM!

 BadPiggy#5202: It's gotten very slow rn
I'd say it's already breaking
 Woum#5790: In 2 hours then?
 Scolon#4218: Yeah don't delete your submission page
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: submissions are not closed, you can still update your game files for 2 hours
 Gisleburt#3004: I guess its against the spirit of the jam to continue working on your game now? (Please say no, I desperately need sound and a pause menu 😂 )
 krisis in a jar#0904: I wonder how itch.io doens't break with this many people submitting their games
 Tuja#4574: Upload a file with the same name
 Ceding Tree#1081: Thank You!
 snuffysam#2767: gotcha
yeah, i was just wondering when we get to see the list of submissions (:

GOOD LUCK EVERYONE
 DevByMarc#7784: Clutch gene
 Ceding Tree#1081: making the final build now! How do i replace my submission build?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Submissions will still be open, but we recommend that you have finished your gamedev efforts now. If you haven't uploaded, do it now! 🙂
 dardasaba#9759: No, submissions are still open during the 2 hour grace period
 krisis in a jar#0904: power move
 gamedevperson#8448: try your screens resolution
 SLiV#5820: Phew, managed to get sound done and balance the game a little bit. It is probably still way too hard and needs a tutorial, but oh well.
 Starch_Supreme#4835: im gonna submit 1 second before 😼
 The Mayday Man#8467: my thumbnail on itch wont upload
 snuffysam#2767: so after the grace period starts in two minutes - submissions are closed, but new builds can still be uploaded, correct?
 KadDev#8100: I did like 6x more today than yesterday and the day before yesterday combined
 krisis in a jar#0904: I think it already started
 syelan34#3258: i've figured out my issue, i was going to itch.io's home folder, not my game's home folder
 Kasper#4286: this was /is my first Jam guys , had a blast!

 Julien#2204: I'm gonna fix and polish as much as I can for 2 hours, game still isnt' ready to be played 😦
 Roiboi#2055: because i made "music volume" appear twice in the settings
 IntangibleMatter#2281: Fine, I'll abuse my newfound custom CSS patterns later....

 SlamBamActionman#7160: Ok don't do *this* 😛

 krisis in a jar#0904: *joins with all my alt accounts*
 ZedDev#4726: 960x600 if you're making a web build

If you have teammates who haven't joined yet, get them to! 😄
 GuyWithTime#7852: I just added all my sounds in the last 15 minutes
Yeah Im a bit of a speedrunner
 paulpork#7383: What a flex
 ZedDev#4726: Fixed that bug, i can now build
 krisis in a jar#0904: It's probably because of the small time frame, so you tend to get more desperate and in turn work more
 JJfriends#3686: images are going slow NOOOOOOOOOOOO my project is looking like shit
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Itch is going to crash within the next 2 hours, I know it...
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: if you want 16:9 then 1280 x 720 is good
 akaBl4ck#7384: I think I've broken my back
 SlamBamActionman#7160: People might not have joined in on the jam on itch, but been working on the game still
 Omegnight#7081: Maybe for collaborations or teams
 DarkKapla#9187: lol
 paulpork#7383: Submitted a beta version, gotta complete all the thing in the next 2 hours
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: the game is finishing in 2hours...AND THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE JOINING ???!!!
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: the image server is physically separate, at least aiui from itch staff statements. the actual builds are still going through, you can add images later
 Mukhavertolet#2243: For some reason i usually make more in 48 hours than in a week
 Tyler Hunter#0474: Any?  it just crops the game
 akaBl4ck#7384: I'M FINISHED OMGOMGOM
 krisis in a jar#0904: Hopefully most people managed to upload their games

 MrBen#0001: me 6 :)😛
 FryDev#0372: well, this experience definitely gave me a new appreciation for week long jams
 velvetlobster#4638: been trying to submit in the last 15 min or so
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: **Make sure you have submitted your game to the jam and not only uploaded it to itch**
Cheat sheet about launching a game on itch but also super importantly the last step of adding the game to the game jam
 theChief#0001: ah damn it, I guess I'll sort the page tomorrow lol
 Mrinin#2181: it's still half of last year but you know,  everyone will upload their game last second and crash itch
 HerrCron#5856: We're working on it, goddamnkt
 MrBen#0001: same here 👀
 krisis in a jar#0904: I think i'm going to just update the windows version and that's it
 CSharp#4989: hmmmm i wonder how we can upload 7zs and other zips but not pngs
 dardasaba#9759: I did! Over 5 hours ago :)
 theChief#0001: I think there'll be 5,000 by the end of the submission period xD
 Woum#5790: Ha, itch is having hard time right now, can't change the pic of my game 😄
 IntangibleMatter#2281: GAME HAS BEEN UPLOADED, JUST DOING THE ITCH PAGE! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
 velvetlobster#4638: it seems gmtk is breaking itch.io
 Mr. Tophat#9572: Oh dear, itch.io appears to be struggling, it failed to upload my new screenshots...
 Lehoux#3697: Holy moly that's a lot of games to play
 BrokenCalculator#2386: finally the builds are done
 JJfriends#3686: the fact that me as a solo dev did way better than some teams with 5 people is already good enough for me
 MrBen#0001: did everyone submit their games?
 CSharp#4989: Just submitted and now waiting for itch.io to let me upload an image now
 krisis in a jar#0904: salesman 1999
 Mark Brown#6982: i mean last year i did play games made by GMTK patrons so, you know...
 Mark Brown#6982: Hey, you! Yes, YOU! Over 2,000 people have already submitted a game. **Why haven't you?**
 dardasaba#9759: I don't think so, my game is quite small in the first place so idk how I can expand it anyways
 JJfriends#3686: mark Ill give you $3 if you play my game
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Easier! 🙂
 Mukhavertolet#2243: you don't need to worry about that. Some last year's winners had like 20 ratings
 krisis in a jar#0904: The Windows build of my game is littered with bugs most of them are related to the game's window
 NoFace#5304: Yo, to anyone who joined the GMTK jam, just dm me yer entries so I can review and rate them on stream!
 Mrinin#2181: have fun cuz your about to have the most stressful hour of your life
 Mark Brown#6982: you can upload now if you like!
 Acu1000#5560: Does having more people review the game make it easier or harder to win?
 Omegnight#7081: Oh, we now see the number of entries on the page !
 USER#8646: oh ok thanks
 SIA#6285: i have a question how do i make this link have an embedded  image ?
like the ones people are posting on reviewmygame
 JJfriends#3686: i think i did a really good job with it but I'm worried people won't play
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Yup
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: you submitted the game page, not the specific build. when you update the build it just works
 Tyflon#3487: Can I upload in 20 min?
 RGBCube#8833: im honestly glad i was able to finish a game at all, considering i havent up to this point
 JJfriends#3686: really? sweet alright
 USER#8646: i did
do i not need to resubmit to the jam?
 NoelJasik#8768: If it's a web game, don't worry
 Scolon#4218: Alright, my game is up and works great
I could try for one more update to add a small amount more polish
I'm not going to risk adding anymore content
 pibolib#2222: i think i definitely spent at least 25-30% of my jam time just playing my game with no real aim
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Then you can upload the newer version on the old version's itch.io page
 Renard#3525: Submitted and its my first jam submission!
 krisis in a jar#0904: Are you guys going to update your games after the jam is over?
 holya#6847: that was a wild two days but definetly fun ones? submitted our cute little game hehe
 USER#8646: it is public
edit: i already have an upload im trying to upload a newer version
 Tuja#4574: You only really have to worry if it needs a download
 SIA#6285: hello
 Fnessa#8531: I won't be able to finish my game in time, so i'm quitting, but it still was totally worth it. It was an amazing experience, and i'm 100% trying again next time. Thank you for the nice people here that helped me overcome technical difficulties, it truly is an amazing community.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: We know. Try again later when thousands of people aren't try to put a game up at once
 Mark Brown#6982: we're aware of itch.io's image server being slow - please try again later. you can upload your cover during the voting period so don't panic!
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Please read the post in  about that
 krisis in a jar#0904: Fine so far
 BrokenCalculator#2386: you can just let people know in the description of your game i guess
 dhafo#4640: guess imma upload the windows version for now lol
 Mrinin#2181: In this jam I made my first 3D game, which was absolutely not stresfull at all just kidding I can't believe I made it either. If it was 48 hours  again I might not have been able to do the polish.
 Hobusu#5033: Better to upload something and then see if you can squeeze in a bug fix before the end than to not submit anything at all!
 AZOTh the Creator#7094: i can't upload cover imageeeee
 DevByMarc#7784: Congratulations!
 JJfriends#3686: How do I get people to play my game cause like I feel that people won't click on mine and they won't get to experience how good it is and it'll never get in the video
 Lunar#4998: how's it going everyone
 krisis in a jar#0904: Imagine if Mark Brown had to review all the games alone lol
 ZedDev#4726: My game decided to break, i can either post it as is but people will have to reload the page when they want to restart, or i just don't post anything
 USER#8646: public i think let me double check
 NoelJasik#8768: It has to be public
 Mark Brown#6982: is your game public or draft?
 USER#8646: hey itch.io says that  i have no projects i can submit but i do
 BurgerWizard#8683: Just submitted the game! I can't believe I actually managed
 Hobusu#5033: Yes! Only the game files are locked during the voting period
 Mrinin#2181: Yes
 ChipmunkDev#1808: can we submit the game but edit the jam page after submission as long as the game stays the same
 Hobusu#5033: There's no material difference, but it's recommended that you already be done with development and only use them for last-minute submission if needed
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: no,i was so disapointed to don't code my game with godot
 krisis in a jar#0904: It'd be cool if there were "spinoffs" of the GMTK jam, like one with an increased time period or different rules, etc
 aridai#3842: yeah, godot rules!
 Mark Brown#6982: nope!
 Mrinin#2181: Is there any difference between the first 48 hours and the last 2 grace period hours, (other than how we should've submitted anyway)
 Hobusu#5033: Yes, even after submissions close you can edit your game's page!
 MaryStrawberry#4672: can I edit the page after I submitted and uploaded the game?
 Mukhavertolet#2243: I submitted, now I can relax
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: me discovering godot after ther jam:
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i absolutely understand (and am absolutely thankful for the extra 2 hours this year, btw. Thank you Mark.)
 borboss#7877: I learned so much and now there's so much that could break cause I tried so many new things this time around lmfao
 krisis in a jar#0904: Something like this always happens with a big game jam lol
 DevByMarc#7784: No
 Oni?#6198: ye my game bussin fr
 BrokenCalculator#2386: rip
 imperial fool#2315: man I forgot to download the webGL module for Unity lol
 borboss#7877: yeah, itch is being slow with image uploading rn
 krisis in a jar#0904: Damn, epic games be trembling rn
 Oni?#6198: I made fortnite 2
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: pretty much done, just need for itch to collaborate and upload my images :(
 dhafo#4640: yeah i figure if i can't figure it out soon i'll do that
 Sappir#7051: Anyone still up with me from 12 hours ago?
 Vabenil#5485: Great, gotta thank those programmers
 BRICAT#6837: yeah I think I will not be able to finish it. but I just want to upload my progress so far.
 krisis in a jar#0904: Try compiling the game to EXE if you can't compile it to WebGL in time
 CraaazySteeeve#7242: Just checking, anyone having issues uploading screenshots/cover photos to itch,io at the moment?
 RGBCube#8833: webgl is annoying sometimes

 Acu1000#5560: When does the voting period end?
 Mrtubagames#1683: But if you do, you can't update it until after the jam.
 CALSYTHE#6648: learning a new work environment is a challenge!
 dhafo#4640: i have a full game and everything 😭 but the webgl keeps breaking i'm hoping i can upload in time for the deadline
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: is my english good ?
 sqrt#9237: cubers when they meet each other :
 RGBCube#8833: yes
but im just saying i found another cube
also i was gonna send that earlier but forgot
 krisis in a jar#0904: I wonder how many people released their first game on this jam...
 BRICAT#6837: cool!
 Mark Brown#6982: sure! but maybe explain what's broken/working in the description 😉
 Vabenil#5485: I didn't have enough time, my fault for using an engine I didn't know on my first game jam. Had to learn Godot from scratch
 Fusoy#6101: Of course !
 syelan34#3258: yeah, you still have some time to edit
 NoFace#5304: Again, just to get more coverage, If you need some rates and reviews by me, just dm me your game link and I will add it to a queue of entries I will play first thing tmmrw
 Mrtubagames#1683: I'd asume so
 CALSYTHE#6648: if you need more time, start travelling west faster than the earth rotates
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: he was here WAY before you
 BRICAT#6837: One question, is this okay to upload unfinished game?
 RGBCube#8833: hey look another cube
 syelan34#3258: i'm just using plain JS
 Acu1000#5560: There was something about Gzip with Unity web games on the submit page
 krisis in a jar#0904: Oh, i thought we were in the grace period already because of the warning on the jam page, i might still be able to upload the updated Windows build
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: why everybody is naming they dice "dicey" ?
 wumpus#3512: yeah i did, i have already uploaded, I thought i had some how managed to like skip ahead 2 hours, im too tired for this lmao
 Toboter#5206: I can't find out how to mark the Zip as web executable.
 Rilic#8461: uGH I don't even have sound yet aaa
 syelan34#3258: no it runs fine on anything but itch
 Scolon#4218: Well I managed add a ton of new rooms for gameplay variety, but sadly I don't think I have time to add any enemy variety
 davidnjihiahere#6326: what?
 CALSYTHE#6648: He said 'And stuff' - that means lots of time to hire extra artists.  :p
 JuliusCube#8501: i guess i just misremembered
 Mark Brown#6982: nope, 20 minutes to go! like the message says! 😄
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: you will be in 20 mins
 Toboter#5206: ... has itch removed the WebGL feature?
 poila#4113: Understood. I already submitted to Itch, then I shared my entry on the game jam page's form.
 Mark Brown#6982: Did you not get the multiple emails, watch the youtube video, see my tweets, read   on this discord, or read the info on the jam page, lol
 krisis in a jar#0904: Are we on the grace period already?
 syelan34#3258: i get an error saying "AccessDeniedAccess denied.Anonymous caller does not have storage.objects.get access to the Google Cloud Storage object."

 Acu1000#5560: You still have 2 hours to figure out the issue
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: 40% of the time,i was tryharding my game
 unityAccount#7810: Has itch crashed already?
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Remember that there __will be **no exceptions** for late submissions__, so act like the deadline is  rather than  and use the final two hours only to make sure that your game has been submitted successfully (and for updating your game after you've submitted it)!
 Acu1000#5560: When will Mark be playing the top 100 games?
 syelan34#3258: my game isn't playing for some reason

 Mark Brown#6982: 20 minutes for the 48 hour jam - then two more hours for emergency uploads and stuff!
 Henry_Hamster#4240: 20 mins and 2 hours technically just for like making sure your thing didn't break while submitting
 FryDev#0372: 48 hours is very short
 Hobusu#5033: Yes, as long as it's before the submission window ends! Once we reach the voting period you can only change the game's page on itch.io, not any of the game files
 Hederlunden#3231: i dont like 48 hour jams, 48 hours is not enough time to make so many games
 JJfriends#3686: wait WHAT 20 MINS LEFT
 wumpus#3512: wait we have 20 mins left?
 Mark Brown#6982: yep!
 NotAHuman#2014: tough
 Roiboi#2055: hey if you submit the itch.io page to the jam can you modify the game before the period closes?
 FryDev#0372: I’ll still submit my game, but it’s pretty much unplayable unfortunately
 Mark Brown#6982: Biggest was 47,000
 Galactum#6235: so i have to add a title screen and a tutorial to my game in 20 minutes, yeouch
 CadenJO [DM to trade ratings]#2365: thanks
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Well, it's sad but I'm pulling out this year... I don't think I could even get a simple beta running in the short allotted time I have left to me... I'm sorry...
 krisis in a jar#0904: WOW, that's quite alot
 Hederlunden#3231: i feel like i might give up. the game was cool, looked cool, the idea was unique and i think it wouldve had potential in the jam, but i didnt quite make it
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: ggj is really just a bunch of different regional jams
 Hobusu#5033: Periodic reminder for everyone to check the most recent post in  if you haven't already!
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: **Make sure you have submitted your game to the jam and not only uploaded it to itch**

 JuliusCube#8501: global game jam had over 100000 participants actually
 Mark Brown#6982: GMTK has more sign-ups and games per year than LD (though it doesn't really matter, all jams are great! Do both!)
 BrokenCalculator#2386: i suffered from bad game design
 Jasper#7906: Pffoof. Submitted a pretty good build. Now, there's two more features that are on the wishlist, let's see what I can do in the extra time for those two... (without breaking things, that is)
 krisis in a jar#0904: i suffered from the opposite, i was scared that i was adding too many features
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: I think it was ludum dare
 BurgerWizard#8683: Ooooo, this is my first time taking place in a jam after using unity for 3 years
 Mark Brown#6982: It's the biggest online-only jam - Global Game Jam is much, much bigger!
 borboss#7877: i think i shrunk my scope too much but I also didn't want to run out of time
if I had more time, I had alot more ideas :(
 Acu1000#5560: it was even bigger in previous years
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: it was named Game Maker Tool Kit Jam
Not a game jam it's a jam
And no year
 Henry_Hamster#4240: well at least you worked hard and probably practiced a lot and maybe even learnt something in this jam, look at it positive
 krisis in a jar#0904: Wow, and now it's the most popular game jam (i think)
 Redline#7370: exporting now, I'll upload to itch, then go back and try to get hitmarkers to work
 Zigordion#3748: i suffered so much from feature creep this time around
 unityAccount#7810: I was only able to work today. After 8 intense hours of work, my game still missed a bit to become playable-enough for a serious entry so I just uploaded a broken thing. It was fun and I had never been this fast and productive before but it is disappointing to do all this work for nothing😞.
Good luck everybody else!
 Henry_Hamster#4240: if only I could just like yk turn it off D:
 Mark Brown#6982: First one was 2017!
 dardasaba#9759: I think the first one was in 2017
 Jasper#7906: You've been told a dozen or so times not to speak French in this server over the weekend...
 Rilic#8461: My game turned out to be an absolute travesty and idk how to feel about it lmao, I know it's just a game jam but ech
 krisis in a jar#0904: When was the GMTK jam created?
Other languages can be used in DMs
 Tuja#4574: Question: If I upload a file, and make it hidden, can I unhide it after the deadline?
 RGBCube#8833: i would definitely not recommend panicking lol
 borboss#7877: they said to panic (don't, i'm sure everyone did wonderful)
 akaBl4ck#7384: what did they say?
 OrangoMango#0973: just finished
 Hobusu#5033: Please don't make jokes like that, people are already on edge enough as-is and copying the format I'm using for actual announcements isn't clever
 Mukhavertolet#2243: do 3d games usually have good performance in webgl? should i make a webgl build?
 krisis in a jar#0904: *me like chaos*
 borboss#7877: submitted my game but i feel like i forgot something important
guess we'll find out
 Borbito#0304: The most cursed comment
 akaBl4ck#7384: i actually made a pretty decent song in fl studio
 ESC#8775: I just want to say, thank god for the 2 additional hours
 sqrt#9237: pay money
 Hobusu#5033: Don't know, but I'd recommend submitting what you already have first, then re-building and submitting that if you can before the deadline
 Astrallion#3773: How do you make a splash screen in unity?
 Borbito#0304: Yes
 Zigordion#3748: sry unity
 FryDev#0372: nope
 AaronBacon#2374: In unity, possibly
 Borbito#0304: Depends on engine
 Astrallion#3773: How do you make a splash screen in unity?
 krisis in a jar#0904: yessir
 Zigordion#3748: does building a webgl take a shorter amount of time the second time you build it? i have a very minor fix
 Hobusu#5033: Periodic reminder for everyone to check the most recent post in  if you haven't already!
 CrashCubeZeroOne#0715: oh alright

 RedSantar#0027: game finished.
 Borbito#0304: Not till voting period is over, update before the submission due date if you already submitted
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: there is still time to submit it, this discord should be for the game jam games
 Mukhavertolet#2243: hey, did you finish your games?
 CadenJO [DM to trade ratings]#2365: uh oh gotta go fast
 krisis in a jar#0904: i hate windows so much
 Gisleburt#3004: Thanks!
 Mark Brown#6982: yep 👍
 Hobusu#5033: Yeah, just update the project files on itch.io and you should be good to go
 BanananaMonke#3591: Les goo submitted
 Borbito#0304: No
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Nope. Well, you can, but they won't be counted in the jam
 Gisleburt#3004: Just update the project on itch?
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Let's keep well-justified excitement to  !
 CadenJO [DM to trade ratings]#2365: Are you allowed to make bug fixes/fix serious balance issues post deadline?
 krisis in a jar#0904: I WILL EAT **4 LEMONS**  IF I GET IN THE TOP 100
 CrashCubeZeroOne#0715: Thanks. I take it it's fine if it didn't make it to the jam?
 Hobusu#5033: You should just be able to update your existing submission, as far as I know!
 Borbito#0304: I submitted too, feels great 😃👍
 krisis in a jar#0904: me
 Gisleburt#3004: Once you've submitted your game once, if you change it, do you have to re-submit it (my project no longer shows but it is in the submissions page)? (silly question I know)
 Russian posh cat support ukraine#6575: anyone else panicing :|
 ProtoXV#2705: Just submitted mine! I'm honestly not proud of it, but hey I learned some things and I can finally say I participated in a jam :D
Very excited to see what everyone else has come up with. Good luck to everyone still working like mad!!
 akaBl4ck#7384: MY UPLOAD SPEED IS COMING IN CLUTCH i have 2 mbps download and 5mbps upload!!!
 MistTree#0001: aaaaaaand, submitted!!!

 BrokenCalculator#2386: gl
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: 
 Captain Poontang#0601: Submitted! Good luck all
 Acu1000#5560: game jam speedrun any%
 budget#0365: Alright soon I'll get started on my game, the pressure of only having 36 minutes to work on it really gives you the greatest end product
 Toboter#5206: Does anyone know where in your itch profile you can find the game jams you're currently participating in?
 BrokenCalculator#2386: my game can be summarized as a going back and forth & pressing space simulator
 krisis in a jar#0904: there ins't that many people typing tho
 CrashCubeZeroOne#0715: Is promoting your game if it's late allowed? I'm new here
 RGBCube#8833: slowmode is what it is when there are many users in the server
 Borbito#0304: Same
 USER#8646: ok thanks
 krisis in a jar#0904: i hate this chat delay
 Hobusu#5033: Check the pins in , there might be something useful there!
 Acu1000#5560: on itch io or theres some links in the jam's page
 BrokenCalculator#2386: my go to genre when i have no clue is a 2d platformer because i can make them the fastest
 Borbito#0304: Yes
 Snage#1337: 36m* other 2 hrs are for submission saftey net
 USER#8646: anyone know where i can find free music that fits the theme
 AdamTheRookie#7765: oh (:
 Acu1000#5560: is the time on your computer set correctly?
 krisis in a jar#0904: My game is a bullet hell because if you don't know what to do you make one, it's the safest option
 Borbito#0304: It's due in 3 hours
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: but the windows build work *al dente*
 CrashCubeZeroOne#0715: aight I admit defeat, GL everyone
 shamantitan#0301: Thanks!
 USER#8646: mine is extremely simple and doesnt really have a theme
 Lunar#4998: rip
 gamedevperson#8448: damn i have to wait another lifetime to build again
 Acu1000#5560: are you sure you have the right jam?
 BrokenCalculator#2386: sad
 budget#0365: Interesting, I will look forward to seeing it
 USER#8646: its really different from the original idea now its about just rolling dice and using them in combinations to get points
 Henry_Hamster#4240: remember to turn of compression
 Omniclause#4760: You can update game as many times as you want before deadline and definitely should upload soon. Itch will almost certainly be crashing at the deadline
 RGBCube#8833: \> 4 days
what
it says 2 hours 36 minutes left for me
 Lunar#4998: it says 2h and 36 minutes for me
 gamedevperson#8448: my webgl game wont load in itch, useful
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: my macos build doesn't work perfectly,so my dad can't play it :(
 AdamTheRookie#7765: check the itch page, it says 4 days, 23 hours, 37 minutes left
 krisis in a jar#0904: Well, this was my first published game and i'm pretty proud of it, even though the windows build looks like a virus lol
 BrokenCalculator#2386: let's hope the same is true for the webgl build
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: don't be trolling, people are working hard trying to get their games finished
 Henry_Hamster#4240: depends on the vibe of the game's visuals, personally, I made a puzzle game, and its purposely very simplistic and clean in the art style and as a result has a ultracalm soundtrack
 q1#3172: time to tackle the final thing, scoring :)
 BrokenCalculator#2386: nice my windows build works perfectly
 Zoro5168#0115: Maybe thats including voting period
 shamantitan#0301: if I upload the game now, can I update the webgl before the deadine or is it unalterable?
 birdstone#3073: ah ok
 Lunar#4998: huh?
 budget#0365: Something calm and melodic probably unless you're going for something more thematic. How'd your game come along also we talked on the first day
 Acu1000#5560: yes
 krisis in a jar#0904: i think that depends on the browser
 benlam2000#3140: Hi can i submit a zipped folder containing a resources folder and exe file?
 AdamTheRookie#7765: um, why does it say 4 days left lol
 Ossian#9383: Feels a bit bad, but at least we decided to finish the game later, because we are all in the same school class
 loogi#4810: i am dead i am now a spooky ghost
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: bit late for that, but  and 
 birdstone#3073: is it weird on webgl it's laggy when you fullscreen but extremely smooth when not fullscreened?
 USER#8646: anyone know what music fits a simple puzzle game
 krisis in a jar#0904: *get rich quick scheme*
 Veqsa#8120: The jam is over my guy,
im sorry
 budget#0365: While at the same time multitasking in another monitor to raise social media engagement over those 30 mins
 Ossian#9383: I decided to leave the jam with my team, we didn't end up finishing in time
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: AGGG I'm not going to make it...
 Veqsa#8120: Okay thanks, yea my game doesnt require to run smooth
i only saw that my button had a bit of delay
 loogi#4810: How do i find a team
 Henry_Hamster#4240: and the true professionals then create a video within those 30 minutes showing their process and get like half a bajillion views on youtube
 budget#0365: On a slightly serious note I did not participate this year because I had stuff come up but I'm most comfortable with C++
 Chienaun#0846: Hi, sorry if this is a basic question, but what should be included in a README file?
 Omniclause#4760: My WebGL build has a little bit of input lag versus in the editor. I hate doing WebGL but you just get so many more plays that way
 budget#0365: I'm currently formulating my game in my brain. Once I have perfectly designed it within my mental prism I will hard code it in assembly language in under 30 minutes.
 FryDev#0372: next jam I’m going to make an actually playable game
 Penguinmanereikel#3708: Instead of making art assets in paint lol
 Penguinmanereikel#3708: Next time, I’m just gonna make heavily stylized pixel art
 krisis in a jar#0904: What did you use to make your game?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: I'm warming some pizza and then I'm coming back for the final stretch. Get your games in everyone!!!
 akaBl4ck#7384: i'm stressed 😭
 SlamBamActionman#7160: We have many rare Link emojis indeed
 Veqsa#8120: Is it normal for the game in the browser to lagg a bit? like 40fps orsmth
 Gabriel Bigardi#2292: my game's code is a delicious spaguetti, but it works
 budget#0365: Rust is cool but I'm definitely not about to learn to use it without good reason, I feel like the memory safety wouldn't be terribly important unless I was really scaling my game
 sqrt#9237: opengl supports rust
 Hobusu#5033: I forgot that was an emote
 SlamBamActionman#7160: I learned better knitting techniques!
 krisis in a jar#0904: I wonder if Rust is also good for gamedev
 Omniclause#4760: I learned random number generation. Wasn’t much to learn though just a single line of code in unity
 nibbbble#2399: i learned that layout groups actually exist 👍
 budget#0365: C++, Java and C# are really nice in that they have the same core tenants and are based on each other (though Java is evil)
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: i did it 4hours ago
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: post it on 
 krisis in a jar#0904: I learned how to compile python code 👍
 kcorb#6614: I learned I need to learn C# for next year (Pygame did not cut it)
 SlamBamActionman#7160: fixed
 The Mayday Man#8467: I learned that i need to git gud at making platformer scripts
 Gabriel Bigardi#2292: please put a heart reaction on this message so i can give it a heart 😍
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: Guy,who whant to check my game ?
 FryDev#0372: I learnt overscoping bad
 krisis in a jar#0904: yea, even though i'm using ursina, the same thing applies to it
 Sol [she/her]#5527: Game jame
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: well I learnt nothing 😄
 The Mayday Man#8467: jame gam
 sqrt#9237: ok bro
 budget#0365: Like pygame is sick when you first use it, but then you damn this kinda sucks to scale
 Acu1000#5560: you might still be able to put some simple audio quickly
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: possibly, depends on how much Itch upgraded their servers after last year. And the year before...
Yet.
 The Mayday Man#8467: now exporting my game!!!!! 😄
 Gabriel Bigardi#2292: well, i mean, tbh i always play games with zero/almost zero volume, i guess its fine
 krisis in a jar#0904: truuue
 hatoving#4710: i think i'll have enough time to upload both builds lmfao
 budget#0365: Python is definitely a false idol when it comes to game dev, it's so easy to modify but takes so much
 sqrt#9237: you gettin payed ?
 Shimp#0064: I can't wait to play some submissions
 Kendo#2848: If my game doesn’t have sound fx is it ok
 Gabriel Bigardi#2292: how can we know you're not a machine ? SUSP
 krisis in a jar#0904: i will make my game in C++ next year lol, so i don't have the problems i had with python
 Lunar#4998: imo yeah, if you have enough time
 Hobusu#5033: Periodic reminder for everyone to check the most recent post in  if you haven't already!
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: it wouldn't hurt, but as long as there's a web build, it should be fine

 Zoro5168#0115: Do yall think itch will crash in the next 2 hours?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Gives that all-important human touch
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Might as well copy/paste stuff
 SlamBamActionman#7160: We did last year, but we're keeping an eye on the channels anyways
 BrokenCalculator#2386: bruh
 Tornado#0975: 
 budget#0365: Alright now that I've taken my two days of rest, time to get started on this game
 Fusoy#6101: itch.io page yes, uploading new game files no
 hatoving#4710: question, would it be a good idea to add a windows build too?
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: yes, only the game files are locked
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: again, ask Mark to let you use a bot
 DAN#2544: Can we edit the submission page after the deadline? (Like the itch. io game description and such)
 USER#8646: what music would fit a very simple game that is just about rolling dice and using theyre value
 dardasaba#9759: Yeah xD
I don't envy you
 SlamBamActionman#7160: We knew what we signed up for lol
 Tornado#0975: GG
 Gabriel Bigardi#2292: Hello people, how you all doing on this year's jam ?
 RGBCube#8833: the jam link seems so important, it should be pinned
*oh wait*
 dardasaba#9759: Poor mark (and mods!) pasting that link thousands of times
 Shimp#0064: If my game was to be shown on stream, i would cringe hard
 hatoving#4710: hopefully webgl will be nice to the game 🥲
 aridai#3842: maybe start with the second point?
audio and freeplay be damned, get a build up!
 Penguinmanereikel#3708: Hi Mark! This was my first game jam and first itch submission!
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: sounds like a bit of over scope, focus on essentials now, you're running out of time. try to get a build up as soon as possible
 Zoro5168#0115: Please do if u have time, itll be fun to see
 MBP#6999: how does the reviewing/ranking work? is it anyone can play and review them, or is it a select group?
 Hobusu#5033: Periodic reminder for everyone to check the most recent post in  if you haven't already!
 akaBl4ck#7384: 1 MORE LEVEL AND I'M FREE!
 dardasaba#9759: Yup!
 hatoving#4710: finally added some polish to my game
i'm done with it!! and it only took almost the entire day lmfao
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Yep!
 Hobusu#5033: Basically, yeah
 aridai#3842: ~~please tell me this is sarcasm~~
 krisis in a jar#0904: lol
 RGBCube#8833: i was planning on upgrading my game's logo but i didnt feel that i had enough time or skill to do it lol
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: and by kicked out, you just mean hide these channels and let the thousands of people sit in the server doing nothing for a year
 Shimp#0064: All in all, for first game jam and second game ever finished, i think I did ok
 Ber#3410: i joined itch.io because of this gamejam
 Mark Brown#6982: i normally livestream games at random - though, haven't decided exactly what i'm doing this year
 MBP#6999: it's so nerve-racking, doing a game jam for the first time.
 Severencir#6708: thank you for inspiring me to "_finish_"* my first project
 Ber#3410: i like how we can make itch.io pages look cool :D
its easy and cool
 Zoro5168#0115: Will you do a livestream while you play the top 100 games
 krisis in a jar#0904: Oh, so the public votes for your game?
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: well then tough luck, you can get a 64-bit PC for barely any money these days
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: see above
 Shimp#0064: Yeah, sorry, read too late
 sqrt#9237: we gettin kicked out ?
 Mark Brown#6982: what carrot said
 Ber#3410: makes sense
 Mark Brown#6982: it stays open during the voting period, until i release the video and reveal the public rankings. then, it goes back to being exclusive to GMTK patrons
 BrokenCalculator#2386: ok fine i give up, i'll just build to 64 bit
 Shimp#0064: When do we get kicked out of this server guys?
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: you get to stick around for a week during the voting period then once Mark has published the results video you all get kicked out until next year!
 RGBCube#8833: so what you're saying is you're gonna go to sleeping accomodation? (read the emote name lol 🛌)
 Yollie#2239: Thank god since my game has like no content lmao
 AromaticA#3738: tried getting into gadot with C#, horrible experience
 krisis in a jar#0904: Python can't compile to WebGL sadly
 Veqsa#8120: Okay cool
 akaBl4ck#7384: mine would be chill if i was actually at home and not on vacation
 Mark Brown#6982: people are playing lots of games, very fast - so a short description is fine
 Ber#3410: what happens to the server when the gamejam is over?
 sqrt#9237: try webgl build
 MBP#6999: "submitted something that works" is such an accurate representation of mine as well
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: poor sack. What did it ever do to you?
 dardasaba#9759: I gotta say - this was my first 48 hours jam, and I thought it's gonna be really stressful - but it ended up being the chilliest jam I joined! Probably mostly because I did well on the "don't overscope" part, but still - both yesterday and today I started working at around 10:00 and stopped working before 18:00, and also had time to just lay in bed and read a book, and still submitted around 10 hours before the deadline xD
So yeah I'll say my jam experience was very good :D
 BrokenCalculator#2386: what if they want to play the game offline? (they wouldn't because it sucks but maybe they will?)
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: it's on line 18
 Veqsa#8120: Is this a good description?
or do you expect longer ones
```​A simple to understand math puzzle
with different difficulties!
It does require some basic math,
but i expect everyone to be able to do the Easy one!
I would like to get some feedback and ideas on what i should add!```
 Scolon#4218: Alright I'm gonna try to add some enemies and spikes and stuff
harder rooms
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Ok guys I'm done, sort of
I submitted something that works, and now I've got other stuff to do and I really don't want to work on it anymore because the next step is not that important and also very annoying to implement
So yeah good luck and see y'all next year
 voithos#0258: I yet again fell into the classic blunder of focusing too much on mechanics and polish rather than level design 😅
 NoFace#5304: gl mate
 krisis in a jar#0904: my game would've been better if windows wans't such a b****
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: and if you have a web build, they can still play that.
 Zayn#4390: Okay guys imma go hit the sack and head over the sleep cuz my eyes are red and hurting aaah, cyall tomorrow
 NoFace#5304: Yo, if you want to have your entry reviewed by me, you can dm me a link to your game so I can play it on stream tmmrw
 RGBCube#8833: i find it funny how i made a better game in 48 hours than i did in a week LOL
 BrokenCalculator#2386: gonna be honest my game would've been much better if didn't spend so much time playing GW
 Aledrite#4274: final stretch, and i have 2 more levels to make. very fun
 Redline#7370: *how about I finish mine first thanks*
 Zayn#4390:  wanna check my game?
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: same
 krisis in a jar#0904: yes
 krisis in a jar#0904: i'm getting paranoic because the windows build is way worse than the linux build
 Redline#7370: test gaem
 BrokenCalculator#2386: well im missing out on 0.26% of people then
 MBP#6999: yeah that 48 hours is tough
 sqrt#9237: i know bro
did you make game ?
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: according to Steam hardware survey, 0.26% of people are running a 32-bit OS
 Mrtubagames#1683: Wow, I just realized my game is near the top of the page in the submisions! (Hopefully I don't jinx myself by saying this 😅 )
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: it's the first time i use an engine to make a game jam game,and it's the first time i publish a game made with a real engine so this game jam resume everything i learn with godot with 1 years of learning,trying,failing...
 BrokenCalculator#2386: still, i'd like for my game to be playable by anybody. even that weird kid who still uses his computer from 2012
 Scolon#4218: Also you guys should really submit soon, there's only 1.8k submissions, which means people are waiting until the last minute
We don't want to cause itch.io servers to go really slow
 Hobusu#5033: Periodic reminder for everyone to check the most recent post in  if you haven't already!
 akaBl4ck#7384: itch.io moment
 krisis in a jar#0904: yea, 48 hours is tough
 Hobusu#5033: The intent of the 2 hour submission window is for you to only use it for submitting your game; we can't *stop* you from developing in that time, but doing so risks that you might not be able to upload in time so we highly recommend against it
 sqrt#9237: pepole go nuts during the last hours of game jams
 BrokenCalculator#2386: lmao same
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: 64-bit is fine, barely anyone has 32-bit anymore
 Scolon#4218: Ok, my game works great and my page is all setup
There is 1 hour left 
I'm gonna see if I can add some additional content
 krisis in a jar#0904: My game won't be as good as it could because i can't compile the newest build to windows, only linux
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: you should get your game submitted ASAP, don't realy on the safety net time
 BrokenCalculator#2386: shit i accidently switched to windows 64 bit instead of 32 bit so i have to wait for it recompile then switch again
 dardasaba#9759: There's nothing stopping you from doing that, but it's against the spirit of the jam - these extra 2 hours are meant for building your itch page
 Redline#7370: that's how I started
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: but everything is good in my game
 Tornado#0975: yes u can but you should upload asap because what if u get some techincal difficulties
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: **Make sure you have submitted your game to the jam and not only uploaded it to itch**
Cheat sheet about launching a game on itch but also super importantly the last step of adding the game to the game jam
 akaBl4ck#7384: time pressure really is magic, level ideas are flowing in to me rightnow
 JuliusCube#8501: im waiting for unity to finish building the webgl version, so i cant really do anything lmao
 AaronBacon#2374: 
 Jolomoju#6021: Hey, I still don't get it. Can we still develop in the last 2 hours?
 BadPiggy#5202: Pretty sure everyone here who's chatting did finish in some capacity at the very least kek
 Lehoux#3697: He's just waiting for worthy Marks to join him
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Gotta speak a language you understand
 Zoro5168#0115: True mod making meme for the members to understand
 BrokenCalculator#2386: the other marks are a more important matter
 Redline#7370: I'm still adding features
 akaBl4ck#7384: man i feel bad for the people that didn't submit
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: you should all be wondering about finishing your games not about what happened to the other marks
 GavRaz#6261: you bring a valid point
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: making everything look good
 BrokenCalculator#2386: oh my god, the webgl build is finally finished. thank god
 JuliusCube#8501: whys the role called mark**s** then?
wheres the mark white, or mark red, or mark orange?
 Yollie#2239: Aaaa peoples games look so good, we’re all doomed bros
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: what is polishing ?
 Hobusu#5033: If at all possible, you should try to sumbit something earlier than that and then update your submission later with whatever's missing, that way in a worst-case scenario you'll still have *something* submitted
 Zoro5168#0115: Next year the themes gonna be MARK
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: you should get a bot to keep messaging this for you
 akaBl4ck#7384: i wanna add a freeplay mode to my game where you're not limited at all
 BadPiggy#5202: ***One Mark to rule them all***
 SAFT_Morlol#2702: When you have 6h to go you should do some polishing or something.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: You think Mark Brown is the original Mark? Really?
 iwonek101#1251: yeaaah i will probably do it in like 2 hours so still i will have an hour to submit
 akaBl4ck#7384: i think i'll be able to submit by 20:00/early deadline
 Mark Brown#6982: because they're not real Marks, they're fake
 wumpus#3512: I know it may seem small to some, but my game hit 5 plays!
 trick0#7801: I wanna cry so hard
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: **Make sure you have submitted your game to the jam and not only uploaded it to itch**
Cheat sheet about launching a game on itch but also super importantly the last step of adding the game to the game jam
 Hobusu#5033: Periodic reminder for everyone to check the most recent post in  if you haven't already!
 Mark Brown#6982: I'd highly recommend not working up to the final submission time! Work for one more hour and then submit, submit, submit!
 MrBen#0001: Mark likes LIMBO?
 Zoro5168#0115: Makes it funnier with his message above yours
 BrokenCalculator#2386: i didn't put music in my game but it's fine ig
 RGBCube#8833: i somehow didnt notice mark's profile picture until just now
i love it lol
 SlamBamActionman#7160: There he is again!
 akaBl4ck#7384: yall aren't really gonna understand it because it's a level idea on my game but it's like that one level from that one jonas tyroller & blackthornprod ludum dare games
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Yes, but I can't stop him. Despite my best efforts, Mark keeps showing up!
 Mark Brown#6982: We all chip in!
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: But when you submit it 6h before the deadlien,you feel like something is worng...
 iwonek101#1251: oh 3 hours left still music left to do
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: isn't that your mods job? Don't you need to be preparing for all the games you'll have to play?
 BrokenCalculator#2386: i would love to submit my game if the webgl build that has been going on for almost 20 minutes would finish already
 Zoro5168#0115: Someone has probably applied both roll of the dice and shoot to move in their games
 sqrt#9237: what is it bro
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: what is ur idea
 akaBl4ck#7384: OMG I JUST THOUGHT OF A GENIUS IDEA
 BrokenCalculator#2386:  i believe
 Lehoux#3697: He's so fast he's everywhere
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: I think that would be a bit unfair
 Mark Brown#6982: Nope! This is for the community, not me. (Plus how could I code when I gotta repeat the same message to you all on Discord a thousand times?!)
 RGBCube#8833: i can help you test (im using linux)
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: no he don"t and he never did
 Saint Dickerson#5381: I mean, the idea is simple, but it was clever, unique.
 Mr. Tophat#9572: Question, what would be the best place to ask for checking if the game works correctly? So far nobody said anything about my submission and I'm worrying whether it runs fine for others
 BadPiggy#5202: He ain't
 Yollie#2239:  are you participating in this jam?
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: Love how Mark just randomly appears to answer a random question every now and again
 Alex Silva#8787: first time I tried (I have 15% of the game lol) and was amazing see how u guys work and help each other ❤️ I think its the best part of the jam. I'll try next year just to see u all working again
 MaryStrawberry#4672: alright!
 BrokenCalculator#2386: the sound effects i made for this game i'd say would be the best sound effects i've made for a game
 BadPiggy#5202: Seems like a little too much praise for someone like me lol
Hope you enjoy my entry if you get to it lol
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: the fact that theres already like 2000 submissions already @_@
 akaBl4ck#7384: i should probably like steal a track from youtube audio library and use bfxr or whatever it's called
 Mark Brown#6982: yes, upload now!
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: i put 0 sound effect and my game is fine
 RGBCube#8833: everyone talking about sfxr and stuff
me, who implemented sound effects directly into my game as code:
 Tornado#0975: yeah he always participate
 MaryStrawberry#4672: ok can I upload my game to itch for the next 3 hours?
 Saint Dickerson#5381:  you're a legend, I'm looking forward to your game. I saw it on Twitter. You have really fun concepts bro. Lol
 MaverickHorn#2838: that's a great step in the right direction 😄
 MrBen#0001: lol
 sqrt#9237: oh shit bro
 Zayn#4390: if anyone want's checkout my game tell me in DMs!
 Acu1000#5560: theres websites with free sounds on the jam page, you can also get them from itch io
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: kenney.nl or sfxr
 RGBCube#8833: ah yes, the RCube
~~ngl that'd be a funny april fools thing where i just change my name and pfp to RCube~~
 BrokenCalculator#2386: also 15 minutes in and the WebGL build is still going
 Zoro5168#0115: Sfxr speedrun
 Mark Brown#6982: 1 hour for the full 48 hour game jam - then another two for final submissions/updates/etc
 JanbluTheDerg#1018: Ghaaaaa re-importing assets
 akaBl4ck#7384: WAIT I NEED SOUND EFFECTS
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: my game is better then my 2021 entry, cause I actually submitted it this time
 BadPiggy#5202: 1h ? Isn't it , 3h to voting ?
 Tornado#0975: I gotta make a connect the wire task Oh man that gonna be hard i think
 Zayn#4390: Just Submitted my Game 😎 , Feelin good
 Zoro5168#0115: RG̶B̶ cube
 RGBCube#8833: im listening to a track my friend made for my game while i wait for the timer to end lol
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: im bored,im wait the vote
 BrokenCalculator#2386: even though my game turned out kinda bad (i'd say it was worse than my last submission for GMTK 2021), the entire development journey to make it was suspiciously smooth
 RGBCube#8833: ~~why are my dice red?~~
~~oh right its because i programmed it to be like that~~
 Zoro5168#0115: Your name
 Saint Dickerson#5381: Nice! I need to find A second programmer who can use mirror for our game. The one I have now is busy ALOT lol
 MaryStrawberry#4672: oh ok, thanks
 JanbluTheDerg#1018: Just gotta get ui and level transitions done...
 Veqsa#8120: the text on itch prob
 Acu1000#5560: if you mean the timer its because its almost over
 Mark Brown#6982: what's "it"?
 BlankSlate#8922: I kept starting from scratch yesterday and ended up wasting a lot of time
 MaryStrawberry#4672: guys why is it red
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: IL2CPP turns C# code into C++, and Emscripten turns C++ into code that runs on the web
 Saint Dickerson#5381: Noted. I'm making a 2d game so unity isn't tripping for me
 Trianull#5928: but for real this jam started just as I got back from a long roadtrip and half the jam already passed before I could think of a solid idea, so my streak since 2019 is broken
 BlankSlate#8922: I finally finished my game and I am actually quite surprise I was able to do it at all
 aridai#3842: hey yall i need help
off my puter atm and can't test if the latest build works
can someone just hop into rolls n trolls and check the html build?
 Zoro5168#0115: Dont have that
 AlolanRaichu#2768: i love how github just wanted to throw errors xd
 Trianull#5928: brb finding a way to upload my brain thoughts
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: I think this was the first time I didn't overscope
 Saint Dickerson#5381: I'm not a scripter, idk what those are :P
 RGBCube#8833: i love how your username is the same as my old username minus one letter
 Tornado#0975: 1 hour left
 Hobusu#5033: Periodic reminder for everyone to check the most recent post in  if you haven't already!
 BrokenCalculator#2386: i can't explain my reasons because im too tired rn but still even without the company's direction the engine crashes frequently and is very slow so it would make life easier if i switched engines
 Zoro5168#0115: Nothing (game 1)
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: like when you don't know the anwser on a test !
 Saint Dickerson#5381: I'm sure A LOT of people are having similar issues, over scoping games.
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: Err... submit your design document?
 FryDev#0372: yeah, at least people might be able to see the idea under the broken unplayable mess
 Jasper#7906: They bought a shady company
 RGBCube#8833: ~~submit it anyways lol~~
 Trianull#5928: ~~what if i have nothing to submit~~
 Zoro5168#0115: Hats off to people who tried,youre better than me
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Remember! Submitting something is better than submitting nothing!
 Scolon#4218: Submit
 Lunar#4998: *proceeds to type SceneManaget instead of SceneManager*
 RGBCube#8833: me when 4 views and 2 downloads in 2 hours
 FryDev#0372: I don’t know if I should even submit
 gamedevperson#8448: yeah unity
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: wanna see it ?
 Kendo#2848: its getting really late and game is unfinished oof
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: What engine? With Unity, you're waiting for IL2CPP and Emscripten
 Alex Silva#8787: we did 🥲
 Saint Dickerson#5381: What's wrong with their direction?
 FryDev#0372: gg’s
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: i finish it 6hours before the deadline !
 Vabenil#5485: Well lads, I tried
 Loogy#3796: guess i'll wait next year, great idea, good team but overscoped
 akaBl4ck#7384: my back is D E A D
 Lunar#4998: oh- i didn't think about this 🧍
 Saint Dickerson#5381: Good Luck to all. 💮💓
 gamedevperson#8448: same
 BrokenCalculator#2386: same here, im 10 minutes in still waiting for it to finish
 Zoro5168#0115: I would too
 Saint Dickerson#5381: Thanks. As you should be, jk jk. Honestly really looking forward to your games.
 gamedevperson#8448: webgl files take so god damn long to build
 Michel#2879: edited the description
 aridai#3842: yeah, but still
good for the unity devs out there
it's not the engine for me, but it's nice to know they have dark mode
 akaBl4ck#7384: did n8dev aia and icoso finish?
 Fredy#5442: Unity just crashed on me and i lost 3 hours of progress ;-; i wanna die
 BrokenCalculator#2386: i intend to leave unity and learn a new engine soon seeing the direction the company is going in
 Acu1000#5560: man Im glad this guy didnt participate, we'd stand no chance
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: **Make sure you have submitted your game to the jam and not only uploaded it to itch**
Cheat sheet about launching a game on itch but also super importantly the last step of adding the game to the game jam
 Saint Dickerson#5381: I couldn't participate. BUT if I could.. I'd win :D jkjk
 JuliusCube#8501: i highly doubt mine will but mine is pretty good apparently so idk
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: Unity dev? Nah, I try to know a decent amount about every engine. Unity, Unreal, Godot, Construct, Clickteam...
 Acu1000#5560: Well yeah, finishing a game in 48h is already a success, getting it featured is a double success
 Avian Overlord#3191: Look, y'all did it. That's an accomplishment unto itself, so feel good about yourselves!
 aridai#3842: mine is too short, hoping for a live stream feature at the very least
 LM#4371: Mine is pretty bad too lol
 Lunar#4998: byeee, yeah honestly this was very challenging
 Hobusu#5033: Periodic reminder for everyone to check the most recent post in  if you haven't already!
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: I know mine won't, it's terrible
 aridai#3842: huh
good for yall, unity devs
 LM#4371: Bye until the next year everyone, I hope your games with be featured :)
 Lunar#4998: yeaaa congrats!!!
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: Not since 2019
 BrokenCalculator#2386: it's in free now too
 akaBl4ck#7384: i haven't even eaten breakfast
 JuliusCube#8501: not anymore
 Acu1000#5560: I have it for free
 aridai#3842: isn't dark mode in unity paid?
 Scolon#4218: Page progress is going well
 Lunar#4998: me when i see a unity youtube  tutorial use light mode:  ⚰️
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i think it's time i submit a first draft
 Penguinmanereikel#3708: WOOO!!! I submitted my first project to itch and my first game jam! 🥳 Does that make me officially an indie dev now 😏
 Zoro5168#0115: Bloom
 NoFace#5304: now to export and publish!
 Hobusu#5033: The Jam rules allow it, but I'm not actually sure whether itch.io makes that possible, so I'd recommend trying to make sure that's all correct the first time just to be safe if at all possible
 aridai#3842: nice
 akaBl4ck#7384: nicee
 Zoro5168#0115: Nice
 MrBen#0001: wow I got 25 downloads in 3 hours
 Jemmeh#7117: Good morning 😁 Time to build today!
 Redline#7370: I don't like how I'm adding features right now
 NoFace#5304: I HAVE FINISHED GAME
 BrokenCalculator#2386: i realized at the very end that my game isn't that fun but oh well, i'll submit it anyways
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: I believe you can update the page once submissions end, just not the game. Before submissions end you can change anything
 aridai#3842: honestly, even though it's technically unfinished (only 4 basic rooms) i'm feeling proud of myself
i actually made what can be called a game for the first time in a year or two
and i'm feeling good about this idea, so i might expand it someday
...i'd just need to iron out the mess of bugs that i've left in there :|
 akaBl4ck#7384: i spent way too much time playtesting my game lol - it's actually kinda fun!
 BrokenCalculator#2386: probably not the best idea but you do you ig
 Mark Brown#6982: We want to make sure that people are only voting on games made during the 48 hours - so for the avoidance of all doubt, I'd recommend against this. that way you'll know for 100% sure you won't be disqualified 😄
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: **Make sure you have submitted your game to the jam and not only uploaded it to itch**
Cheat sheet about launching a game on itch but also super importantly the last step of adding the game to the game jam
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: I might just sit in this chat for the remainder of the Jam and talk to people instead of adding features to my game
 Avian Overlord#3191: And I got much closer than I did last year!
 Veqsa#8120: And dont feel sad,
this is my 6th game jam or so...
and its the first one i kind of finished!
_so dont give up_
 SenderNiel#6583: Will we be able to update things like our team name after we make a submission but before the deadline? Or can we only update the itch.io page once we hit submit?
 Michel#2879: ok
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Please dont make a second page for your game. The jam build is what you got completed, just have the patience to wait until the voting closes to update it
 Hobusu#5033: That would also be dodging the rule that games cannot be updated during voting, and could be grounds for disqualification; you'll be free to edit your game after voting ends, so please don't try to do that!
 Avian Overlord#3191: Yeah, I definitely did.
 Michel#2879: so just adding a note(with no link) is also not ok?
 Veqsa#8120: I hope u had fun and learned something new :)
 akaBl4ck#7384: i'm making this not on my home, on mobile data hotspot and with a trackpad i don't know if my upload speed will be good enough to be able to upload my game lol
 Avian Overlord#3191: I don't think I'm going to make it, but it was a good experience to try.
 Zoro5168#0115: Looking forward to these games and a live stream if there'll be one
 sushiman#4823: ok but i can't because i have a timer of 6h
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: Edit game, scroll to the bottom, set it to public, and press save
 aridai#3842: oof yeah
i'm using godot and an action that i've previously spent hours fixing, so that's why it works smoothly for me ig 😅
 Mark Brown#6982: i would avoid making reference to other builds for the duration of the voting period
 Teslobo#8274: can share it in  if it has been uploaded to itch
 Michel#2879: actually it's the recommended thing
 Penguinmanereikel#3708: It’s says “Draft” on my game.z how do I publish?
 sushiman#4823: so i can't share my game here...
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: No engine, just pure C++ and raylib for graphics/audio
 Amonite#2700: thanks
 Mark Brown#6982: yes! that's the rules 😄
 akaBl4ck#7384: i'm panicking a bit lol my internet is super slow
 Michel#2879: mark, I see in   it's against the rules to link another itch page in the submission. But I think it's okay if I add a note that say
"late updates will be on a different page, so make sure you follow me for that"
 aridai#3842: what engine?
 BrokenCalculator#2386: yep
 Zoro5168#0115: Just an hour left
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: look on your game oage, make sure its public, also chill with the caps lock
 Penguinmanereikel#3708: I actually have 20 mins bc I have some stuff to do
 Amonite#2700: Hi quick question, an html game that plays in browser is good enough right?
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: I spent an hour trying to get actions working but it wouldn't so I just gave up and built manually
 aridai#3842: did you remember to make your game's page public?
 Mark Brown#6982: calm down, you've got several hours to fix this
 Hobusu#5033: No, games are only allowed to be advertised in  (or if people ask you to DM them with it, that's fine)
 akaBl4ck#7384: thanks
 Penguinmanereikel#3708: **EMERGENCY!!!** THE GMTK PAGE IS STILL SAYING THAT I DON’T HAVE A GME PUBLISHED. PLZ HELP ASAP!!!!
 Seet#9247: I found this game that was made years ago that would be perfect for this game jam
Yarr 'n Gee by Murzy&Swonqi
 sqrt#9237: i hope you finish you game on time bro.
 sushiman#4823: so just can i share my game here because i have a timer of 6h in channel
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: it won't break it, in fact it's good to make sure it works
 BrokenCalculator#2386: only had time for 3, but it's ok i guess.
 aridai#3842: thank god for github actions
i don't need to spend the last hour exporting builds to itch manually
 Hobusu#5033: A reminder for everyone to check the most recent post in  if you haven't already!
 Lunar#4998: yeahh, this will come in handy at some point for sure
 Pixstatic#3464: after the 7 or so game jams I've done, this one taught me the same thing that all the others taught me: don't overscope!!!
 MrBen#0001: I did 10 of those 😏
 Veqsa#8120: yea okay so that should not break it?
 BrokenCalculator#2386: woooo im done. time to build
 hierophant#1464: i got pretty far but unity random decided not to let my game upload
 akaBl4ck#7384: nah, i need to make 3 more levels
 BadPiggy#5202: Woot. My game works lol. Everything's done now
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: run it to make sure it works
 39#6748: same, i wasted like 4 hours twice and then just said f* it lets do it the other way
 MrBen#0001: dm me link
 sqrt#9237: bro you finished your game?
 Veqsa#8120: Is there anything wrong with running the build before uploading?
or does it have to stay fresh and unopened?
just to be sure
 39#6748: im so glad and happy i actually finished the game lol
 Lunar#4998: what my first game jam taught me:  find quicker solutions to save more time
 akaBl4ck#7384: i may or may have not woken up at 6 pm
 Pixstatic#3464: it's 1:40 am and I have school today, jammin so hard 😩
 akaBl4ck#7384: I ACTUALLY MADE A LEVEL THAT'S FUN OMG
 Veqsa#8120: Oh thanks
 Pixstatic#3464: FINALLY DONE OML
 Scolon#4218: Also I fixed the root cause of the error, yay!!
 wumpus#3512: You need to select web build, then upload a web build and a exe build select the web build as the "browser play" and leave the other blank
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: HTML, its needed for embedding Web builds
 sqrt#9237: guys you makin games ?
 Aledrite#4274: thanks :D
 steve#7574: uploading my game rn
 NoFace#5304: Go Mate!
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: You can submit builds for any platform you can build for, just make sure there's at least a windows or Web build
 Veqsa#8120: then what "kind of project" should i choose
 Scolon#4218: I cut a lot of corners in my code so there's a bit of spaghetti.
But since this is a game jam I don't care that much heh
 wumpus#3512: Yep!
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: Took me 1 day to come up with an idea and code a basic window
 shuhai#8582: hahaha,me too, I really feel like my code this time is shit
 Veqsa#8120: Is it possible to have both webgl and windows on itch?
 Aledrite#4274: 3 more levels and I'm done
 akaBl4ck#7384: took me 1 day to code my movement and IT SUCKS
 JanbluTheDerg#1018: I had started coding a camera yesterday, but then I had quickly realised that someone probably already made one that works just fine, try to cut down on the time consuming code as much as possible
 Danny Dan Dan#6699: Ooh you're right! Maybe there's hope yet!
 Zayn#4390: almost finished with my game
 akaBl4ck#7384: i need to finish like 4 levels omgomg
 MassedUp#8420: i just have to do all the non programming stuff now
 Scolon#4218: This is my 4th game jam but I also haven't jammed in over 2 years lol
 Balrajjjjjj#8760: exactlyy
 shuhai#8582: Thanks you! I will participate in other gamejams in the future!
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: This is my third jam that I've submitted a game to, and it's the worse game I've made. The point is that I had fun and learn stuff
 JanbluTheDerg#1018: See if you can yoink someone elses level loader, check asset store for your engine of choice!
 SlamBamActionman#7160: See if you can slap together the simplest thing possible, just some sort of change whenever you get to the end of one level. Doesn't need any fancy transitions
 gomorrah#9700: yeah, im planning to submit whatever i have, all i need left is some kind of visuals
 Rilic#8461: What if my project is immensely unbalanced? :')
 Danny Dan Dan#6699: I don't think I'm gonna finish in time to submit 😦 I still need to implement my level loader and I've never done that before
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: As long as you learnt something, you did good. Do more jams, and by next GMTK jam you can say you've improved.
 Mr. Tophat#9572: You can always try to cut stuff that's unfinished
 sushiman#4823: sorry..
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: **Make sure you have submitted your game to the jam and not only uploaded it to itch**
Cheat sheet about launching a game on itch but also super importantly the last step of adding the game to the game jam
 Ostro#3849: should i still submit my game, i didnt get to finish most of my gameplay
 Lunar#4998: aah i finished quick bio of my gamee: "It's a story horror game that follows the story of a gambler that goes through the horrors and terror of the unexpected events just by rolling a dice, will they reach the end? or fall into despair and stay in the never-ending loop of being hunted by it."
 The4thAD#7854: Gotcha, thanks
 Hobusu#5033: They are, though this isn't a *huge* deal since images can be edited after submissions end
 Balrajjjjjj#8760: this is my second and my game's still trash! don't beat yourself up I'm still having a great time
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Sorry, if you deleted your message there is nothing we can do. We can't control the Discord timer individually
 Mark Brown#6982: I will stream games, yeah - all the details will be announced next week
 JanbluTheDerg#1018: I'm gonna try and get enough stuff done to submit before itch goes down
 sushiman#4823: i deleted it
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Please don't ping Mark about stuff
 The4thAD#7854: I know Mark usually does streams where he plays participants games, will he stream for this game jam and if so may I know how to submit my game?
 Hobusu#5033: See if you can edit your message?
 Scolon#4218: You can edit your message
 akaBl4ck#7384: couldn't you ping a mod or smth
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: This jam always causes issues for Itch, this year will be no different. Didn't someone say they're already having image issues?
 shuhai#8582: To be honest, this is my first gamejam, but I think my work is terrible, maybe I should practice more
 sushiman#4823:  very sorry but i accidently sent a message in  so i have now a 6h timer...
 Hobusu#5033: A reminder for everone to check the most recent post in !
 Hobusu#5033: Yes, but that shouldn't be relied on if you can submit earlier since itch.io *will* be under a lot of stress (whether or not it actually crashes)
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: It's more a last chance to submit
 akaBl4ck#7384: alr
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: You can still make your game you have 90 mins
 akaBl4ck#7384: yes ik but isn't there a 2 hour submission
 sushiman#4823: i deleted it because it was a random message..
 Mr. Tophat#9572: You can edit it
 sushiman#4823: no! i accidently sent a message in  so i have a 6h timer...
 wumpus#3512: i think they meant the one where you cant developer
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: you have been able to submit for the entire duration of the jam
 Tootie#0633: Alright, noted. My bad.
 akaBl4ck#7384: wait are we in the submission period?
 King Sol#2650: This deadline fast approaching. I AM SWEATING!
 Tootie#0633: Thank you.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: For real this is not the time and place to be asking this, you can find all this info online. At the moment people are desperately trying to get jam games finished so please go and do some research.
 Danny Dan Dan#6699: I started learning Unity like a month ago. There's lots of good tutorials but personally I found it best to just try and learn as I go by googling stuff
 MrBen#0001: mostly like: WARNING SCALE OF THE OBJECTS... bla bla bla 🦙
 GuyWithTime#7852: yep
 Peewi#8572: yes
 Lunar#4998: sooo i can submit it now and if there are any bug fixes,  just upload it until the timer runs out?
 Tootie#0633: Thanks for the tips, what engines should I use?
 MrBen#0001: but im not joking its seriously 10000 lines
 rende#8526: Haha same...
 Hederlunden#3231: the map consists of a bunch of cylinders put into an array, kinda lazy but yeah. some cylinders are in the hurt player array, some are in the heal array, some are for going through doors, but everything just stopped working. i tried to change it back to how it was before but no change.
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: Look on YouTube, there is a channel called Brackeys, they made a lot of good tutorial content
 Tootie#0633: How do I even start. I really want to get into this, I find this exciting but i'm not sure
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: go figure out what sort of games you want to make, choose and engine and follow a tutorial
 MrBen#0001: true
 akaBl4ck#7384: i'd say it is, however you need to have some basic knowledge for the game engine you're using and be in a longer jam
 JJfriends#3686: Yeah ur probably right
 rende#8526: Is the new map scaled differently globally?
 Mukhavertolet#2243: then you need to make a tutorial. It's not their fault if they don't know how to play
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: **Make sure you have submitted your game to the jam and not only uploaded it to itch**
Cheat sheet about launching a game on itch but also super importantly the last step of adding the game to the game jam
 JJfriends#3686: People Don know how to play my game and they think it's bugged lmao
 Scolon#4218: Wait my game has billions of warnings?
 Tootie#0633: I want to work with game development and be a coder but where do I start?
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: A jam isn't exactly ideal for learning
 MrBen#0001: you shouldn't better go check my ue log. It has like 10000 lines of errors/warnings
but idc couse the game works xD
 Tootie#0633: I don't even know how to make a game
 Hederlunden#3231: no error, just stopped working after i placed out the new map. the player walks 3x as much now
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: Welcome to me yesterday. I'm lucky I could spend the first day just getting everything set up
 Lunar#4998: oh damn
 rende#8526: Is it throwing an error or does it just not work as intended? its posible we could help
 Scolon#4218: oh no
 MrBen#0001: why :/
 Ceding Tree#1081: game-jam-let-off-steam
 Hederlunden#3231: i didnt learn shit, sorry
 MassedUp#8420: unity decided to crash
 Mukhavertolet#2243: finish or not finish, you still got experience
 Ceding Tree#1081: If you learned anything, it's not wasted. Also, dont do that!
 Tootie#0633: Bro I don't know how to start
 BatYaggy#3015: Y'all got this!!!
 ChipmunkDev#1808: i don't think im going to finish 😦
 Hederlunden#3231: 3 days full of stress wasted i want to kill myself
 birdstone#3073: woooo we managed to incorporate some live instruments into our game
 Ceding Tree#1081: A note to anybody uploading a WebGL build, there is a checkbox you can toggle to set the display size. For some reason it defaults to manual set size and can cause some graphics scaling issues. Learned the hard way 😛
 Relis#1309: alright thanks guys! very helpful ^^
 Hederlunden#3231: im not gonna be able to finish in time because of this random bug
 MrBen#0001: oof
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: yes, and after the deadline you can still edit the page just not the game files
 Hobusu#5033: As far as I know that should be correct!
 ☣ General Sam ☣#2576: People: 4 hours left, let's fix the bugs fast...
Me: 4 hours left! let's start making a game.
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: I spent the past hour trying to compile a Windows Build, only to give up and only submit Web and Linux
 MrBen#0001: Im currently editing my game devlog :)
 Relis#1309: so just to be sure, after i submitted my itch io page to the jam, if i edit the page and files before the deadline it will be automatically be updated for the jam? don't need to do anything extra?
 Ceding Tree#1081: I gotta say, this is my first game jam and it feels pretty great to be able to play my small game in the browser and share with friends! 😄
 BatYaggy#3015: Mark, you should create Constipated Gorilla Studios as ur game company
 Hederlunden#3231: i just got a game breaking bug out of nowhere, ive no idea why, and my script is 1000 lines and spaghetti
 aridai#3842: aight, core game is up and submitted, i just need to add sound effects
 MrBen#0001: I think you will love my game's graphic's Mark 😛
 MrBen#0001: true
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: good choice
 Ceding Tree#1081: I submitted what I have so far, but there are some pieces that need work. Just wanted to get "something" uploaded
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: (also means every year a number of people manage to submit a page but no actual game)
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: Given the state of Itch's servers, don't remove any older builds now, as we all know what happens near the deadline...
 Mark Brown#6982: You can submit your game at any time before 20:00 BST. Once it's uploaded, you can also update your submission at any point before 20:00 BST.
 GothWitchEnjoyer#5196: i submited a wrong build of my game can i change it cause the jam deadline isnt over?
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: the submission is of the game page, not the actual build. if you change the build on the page then your submission has changed, no need to do anything extra
 Delphine Noel#1196: SO I guess everyone's submitted their games
 Mark Brown#6982: Upload a new build!
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: though don't count on actually being able to do that itch.io will probably fall over at some point
 Delphine Noel#1196: Hello everyone
 Ceding Tree#1081: how can I update my submission file?
 Peewi#8572: I used a previous project as a base and didn't change the .NET version
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: you can change the files up until the jam time finishes
 Mark Brown#6982: You can submit your game at any time before 20:00 BST. Once it's uploaded, you can also update your submission at any point before 20:00 BST.
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: only when the time is up
 aridai#3842: are you locked out of changing the project once you submit or only once the alotted time is up?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: 4 ish
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: Isn't 6 LTS now?
 Eyesbesore#7355: how many hours left ?
 MrRedShark77#2280: i submit 😁
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: Okay, thx 🙂
 Peewi#8572: Core 3.1
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: yes and after. though you probably can't change the cover image right now the itch image server is having trouble
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: Framework or Core?
 Ceding Tree#1081: Now that I've made a submission, where can I find information on how to submit changes?
 MassedUp#8420: 4 hours left, time to panick
 Peewi#8572: Mine's about 100MB zipped. And most of it is from including .NET to make 100% sure it runs standalone
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: wait are you able to change the contents of your itch.io page, like the theme and cover art before the deadline?
 Henry_Hamster#4240: fair enough, but I mean like every time you open itch, it jumps you to random anyways, can you change it so it, let say, jumps you to most rated(upon opening the website)?
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: people who didn't submit games to the jam
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: its in the pinned posts
 tykenn#8548: mine was at around 350 mb until I noticed that all the music was getting "compressed" to 10 times its starting size. Now I'm down to about 100 mb
 Scolon#4218: Where is that document for the uh
recommended itch.io dimensions and other recommendations for your itch page
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: take it to  !
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: only if you've submitted something to the jam yourself
 Tyler Hunter#0474: How do I edit this itch.io page to look all nice like have a black background and pixel art text?
 Ceding Tree#1081: man, that feeling when the pop-up box says "Awesome! Your project has been submitted!" 😄
 Henry_Hamster#4240: can you evn change the default?
 Michel#2879: oh that's nice. None-developers like the ones who doesn't have an account or the ones who haven't participated
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: for most people the default is random
 Michel#2879: same but I think most people would go with the default
 Mr. Tophat#9572: So this was my first time participating in a game jam (and also making an actual finished game that's anything other than me following someone's tutorial), and if there's one thing this experience has taught me, it would be that crunch is no joke. I will be a lot more understanding to buggy or less than ideal releases in the future, since there's a good chance the developers simply had no time to do better. I myself stayed up all night trying to get the game done and stressing over whether I'll manage to finish it on time
 Henry_Hamster#4240: also random is default and also more fun for me personally, because playing the top games feels good maybe, but its not like the most fun/helpful way to spend your time
 Peewi#8572: and here I thought mine was big at 250MB
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: I always just chose random
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: **Make sure you have submitted your game to the jam and not only uploaded it to itch**
Cheat sheet about launching a game on itch but also super importantly the last step of adding the game to the game jam
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: non-developers are forced to randomly play games until they've done a few reviews
 Henry_Hamster#4240: I spent like 3 hours frantically submitting hotfixes, got to like v10 by the end of it, finally done I think, or at least I'm too tired now
 Michel#2879: do people usually sort by random?
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: if you keep working on the game right up to the wire and the timer elapses, you WILL NOT be allowed to submit anything
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: my game is barely a game, and as such, it's 1.8MB as an executable, or 800KB as a web build, and most of that is the graphics library
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: the final 2 should be for emergencies and for submitting
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: we get 2 extra hours, so its 4 hours left lol
 Scolon#4218: You should aim to be submitted within 2 hours
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: 2 hours left is the correct way to think about it
 akaBl4ck#7384: i need to make like 5 levels in 2 hours fuuuuuu
 Henry_Hamster#4240: well think about it this way, there are at most only around 100 games on 'top' of popular, most games, as long as it doesn't look skectch, will get a decent amount of ratings although it can vary based on your cover and like gameplay
 RoyalNobody#9379: 4 right?
 Pyth0n#0572: 2 hours left guys!
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: you can put controls into the description
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: it should still appear in the random queue and you're free to post it in  !
 akaBl4ck#7384: I OVERSLEPT
 Lunar#4998: i started adding scripts of the second challenge to the first challenge without even noticing i'm in a different scene 🤡
 Scolon#4218: sec, gotta make sure people know how to play, didn't have time to include an in-game tutorial pop-up lel
 rende#8526: Submited but doesnt have a lot of "feel" how important is that to you guys
 FryDev#0372: welp, guess I'll just submit a buggy, incomplete game
 Michel#2879: my game isn't on submission when you sort by popular. Do you think it still have a chance for people to vote/see it
 NoelJasik#8768: damn
 fp#6298: 4 hours left !
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: yes it does, once that's elapsed, no more uploads are allowed!
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Leave review requests to  and/or DMs  please!
 NoelJasik#8768: Does the displaying time include the extra 2 hours?
 MrBen#0001: sure dm me the link
 rende#8526: Giga chad move
 MrBen#0001: send me ur game
 Ber#3410: Can somebody maybe try my game? Its DiceOut
 Pydude#7379: worse, pygame
Now I'm gonna build the page
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: unreal engine?
 MrBen#0001: my game in on ureal engine so its 90 mb
 Leon the Artist#6349: Thank you
 E0115F 101#2073: Alright thxs
 RGBCube#8833: i think only until the voting period starts (in 4 hours, so you have time)
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Yes
 Pydude#7379: game: is simple, file_size: 700 mb
 E0115F 101#2073: Am I able to edit my project page after I've uploaded it? I made a mistake in my title
 MrBen#0001: also: idk why my game got tagged as nsfw but the problem got quickly resolved lol
 SlamBamActionman#7160: When the timer on itch.io is up, there are no more submissions.
 Mukhavertolet#2243: what how
 RGBCube#8833: fun fact: my `game.lua` scene file is 521 lines long LOL
 Pyth0n#0572: the jam is *technically* 50 hours long but the mods are STRONGLY advising you to spend the las 2 submitting your game. you can submit at any time
 MrBen#0001: wow my game got 173 vievs and 19 downloads in 3 hours 😵‍💫
 Scolon#4218: Ok I fixed it, I'm submitting write away and then building my page afterwards
 Ceding Tree#1081: alright guys, time to start working on my game 😛
 Shimp#0064: 10
 RGBCube#8833: me when lua doesnt have switch:
 8BitRam#9126: Just an FYI, don't try to do a game jam over a mobile Hotspot connection while trying to save data. I underestimate just how much I use the internet for this stuff lol.
 Leon the Artist#6349: Hello, is there a submission time frame or do I need to have the entire thing uploaded and the itch page prepared by deadline?
 Pyth0n#0572: dont worry about ur game being too short, focus on it being fun, if you want, u can make a version 1.1 after the jam
 rende#8526: Depends some mechanics take longer to code, also experience in level design helps
 Mukhavertolet#2243: my code improved so much since last year's jam, i'm so happy
 shuhai#8582: let's try speedrun any%
 BB-G09#4074: completely unrelated to the conversation. My game has gone gold!!
 GuyWithTime#7852: Well thats what im planning to do so go for it
 cardy64#4627: yooo I made a tictactoe ai on my ti plus the other day too!
 Cepi#6516: How long should game be for 48 hour
 shuhai#8582: i start my game dev
 SLiV#5820: Is 2 hours too little time to do both SFX and playtesting? 😅
 JuliusCube#8501: what about switch statements
 xqrd#4298: 5 or 6
 RGBCube#8833: i wrote tic tac toe on my actual ti-84 plus calculator lol
 Shimp#0064: Finally, im done with my small game
 GuyWithTime#7852: 3 Words: if, true, false
 Clpb#8248: nice
 RGBCube#8833: ehh maybe 5 or 6? if you want to judge it yourself i uploaded source code to github
i probably could've compressed gamemodes into one scene but whatever
 JuliusCube#8501: I, too have made a game in a calculator
 No whOne#3210: 1 word: if
 Mukhavertolet#2243: surprisingly it's only 6
 Woahsea#4308: 6 or 7
 sendhelpidfk#6700: i'm finally done, all i need is an endscreen and to submit
 Eliza | ERmilburn02 | BluCherri#0001: about a 7, I wasted a good hour refactoring
 Clpb#8248: yes
 dardasaba#9759: Actually mine isn't that bad this time, I'll say... 4 or something? Not really any messier than my usual code
 AlolanRaichu#2768: the only part of my gamr that looks good is the main menu 🤣
 JuliusCube#8501: lemme guess, a desmos enjoyer?
 rende#8526: Its become un-maintainable 10 hours after i wrote it
 GuyWithTime#7852: Oh wow :O
 steve#7574: 6.5
 Clpb#8248: <----- made the game in a calculator
 No whOne#3210: That's literally me lmao, I finsihed the core mechanics of the combat yesterdat, and today was filled with trying to get upgrades and stuff working.. Now I don't even have more than 1 enemy
 JuliusCube#8501: 8, its awful but it works
 LassiterPrime#8984: Thanks, I doubt I’ll be able to finish but I’m going to try
 Moloch#1312: It's blueprint so, spaghetti is pretty apt.
 Clpb#8248: math
 Ceding Tree#1081: 13
 GuyWithTime#7852: from 1-10 how messy would y'all say your code is for this jam
 dardasaba#9759: Btw, Godot offers an option to embed the .pck file inside the .exe, meaning the entire game is just one file. I normally turn this on, since it means the players don't need to bother with unzipping and stuff, they just download a .exe and run it
This isn't a problem right? Just making sure as you say "upload a **zipped** folder for each platform"
 Ceding Tree#1081: You can just submit what you have, like I am! I have some broken stuff, but hey, I made a game by myself!
 Lunar#4998: auto battler?! that sounds amazing, well good luck, we can do this
 LassiterPrime#8984: Opposite for me, but I overscoped too and still have some coding to do to get the game working end to end. I’m building an auto battler and the combat is done, but I still need to do the randomized selection and shop
 Moloch#1312: Y'know, I've hit a point where I genuinely don't think I'll have this playable by the end of the submission timer. But that being said, I'm having a lot of fun doing everything so far and I think I'm gonna keep going regardless. I quit my last few jams because of stress for the deadline but I've made peace with this one. I'm gonna just enjoy the creation process and keep at it.
 USER#8646: ok
 SlamBamActionman#7160: And in pinned messages
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Also 
 Michel#2879: there will be extra time in this case
 Lunar#4998: oh wow, i finished most of the stuff but i left coding for the last to-do thing..... mind you i'm more of a designer/builder soo uhh
 USER#8646: what if itch crashes
 nicompany#4718: thanks
 SlamBamActionman#7160: That's the cut-off time for submissions. If you haven't submitted by then, you won't be able to submit anything.
 Ceding Tree#1081: hey guys, I am trying to build to WebGL from Unity for the first time, but on itch.IO my game scales the view up or zooms in (not sure which). Any freindly advice?
 RGBCube#8833: i have no idea if my macos build works and i cant test because i have **no** apple devices
so thats why i uploaded the .love file alongside the other 3 builds, just in case the primary builds fail
 LassiterPrime#8984: Yeah. I have minimum like 5-6 hours left to get my game playable so don’t think I’ll be able to submit it in time
 nicompany#4718: in 4 hours?
 Michel#2879: oh now I am reassured I can marry my game after the jam ends
 USER#8646: oh also didnt realize you're mark thanks for organizing this
 nekotheasparagus#0809: Ah, I would double check everything in the project, comb through all the new stuff for a problem
 E0115F 101#2073: When/Where can one see all the submissions to try them out
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: ok i have One hour to finish making this level, then i'll upload the game, and when that's done, i'm going to make some little changes like maybe trying to add sound effects
 nicompany#4718: guys, tell me pls, when will jam end?
 nekotheasparagus#0809: If the game ran previously and you haven't changed anything you can DM me a link and I'll check on my computer to rule out your browser just being weird (I'm assuming it's an HTML play in browser game)
 Scolon#4218: Literally all I did was add a title screen wtf
 Lunar#4998: lmaoo felt this, i wanted to take like a 30 minutes nap but i ended up sleeping like 3+ hours
 USER#8646: will itch.io not crash though
 RGBCube#8833: oh hey my cover image is up now
 Mark Brown#6982: you can upload your game at any point between NOW and 20:00 BST
 LassiterPrime#8984: We’ll looks like taking a “nap” at 2am isn’t a good idea regardless of how many alarms you set.
 Scolon#4218: Why is my game suddenly not working on itch anymore
It just crashes on play 💀
 Lunar#4998: okay phew it loaded, i was trying to get a door asset but it wouldn't load the package 💀
 USER#8646: will we be able to upload the games on the final hours
 RGBCube#8833: rip :(
 Scolon#4218: oh my god wtf
 yugioh#7402: Rip
 Lunar#4998: unity choose to mess with me right now 🧍 ⚰️
 RGBCube#8833: mine's still not up yet
 rende#8526: Yeah mine took a sec too
 39#6748: finally my cover image uploaded
 RGBCube#8833: my submission was actually my first game released outside of scratch lol
 ThatTrashGameDEV#0639: hey
 yugioh#7402: Hello everyone
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: **Make sure you have submited you rgame to the jam and not only uploaded it to itch**
Cheat sheet about launching a game on itch but also super importantly the last step of adding the game to the game jam
 39#6748: yep
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: GMTK accepts no legal liability for damage to your jam entry in the process of your inevitable messy divorce
 The4thAD#7854: I can upload mine so at the very least i dont think its a server problem
 Boechat#7475: But is it just the images? Games are uploading fine?
 The4thAD#7854: Yeah images arent working rn, dont worry you can still update it after the subumission period, jusst not the game itself
 Zayn#4390: I've almost finished my game!!
 Boechat#7475: hey uh is anyone else experiencing issues with itch.io? I can't even upload a cover image for the game, I'm scared about what's gonna happen when I try to upload my game
 Acu1000#5560: All I need to do is add audio and then game is pretty much done
 Omegnight#7081: We actually have far more game made in 48 hours now than there was for the ngage
 rystal#5230: ill pick the last one thanks
 Rilic#8461: I feel really burnt out but all I need to do is balance the game and publish aaaaaaa
 USER#8646: so if its just for the jam i can use personal use assets
 The4thAD#7854: Brb
Checking with my lawyer on the legality of marrying a video game
For a friend, of course
 rystal#5230: Uh oh
 Mark Brown#6982: sell it! update it! port it to the nokia ngage! marry it!
 Acu1000#5560: So it began...
 Mark Brown#6982: whatever you want - the game must be free for the voting period but once that's over you can do whatever you want with the game
 Acu1000#5560: If you don't make any money off it then it's not commercial
 39#6748: lol i just came here to ask if anybody else has problems uploading a cover
 Tom Ragtag (He/Him)#8723: For licensing purposes? I'd say personal use (unless you charge money 🙂 )
 USER#8646: is the finished game considered commercial use or personal use
 Tom Ragtag (He/Him)#8723: When doing a Mac build with Unity, does anybody know what settings to use so that the user can run it without the annoying security popup?
 The4thAD#7854: Nice, good luck 👍
 Scolon#4218: That is true
My current build is compiling and deploying rn
 The4thAD#7854: I mean you could work on it after you have an initial build, so if you dont have enough time you could submit your old one
 Scolon#4218: Still sad about not having the time to add a certain mechanic though
Well I technically do have the time to add it, but doing it this late would be risky
 Tyflon#3487: I just made a page for my game. Can I link it to the Jam even when I am still working on it? (I found the answer) (Yes)
 The4thAD#7854: ~~The only thing I've learned is that i suck at playing my own games~~
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: i've found about ten so far, i'm sure there's dozens that need to be reported. a lot are android games, or were submitted within the first couple hours
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: now that the submissions are open, people are free to check through for spam games - games that were published months before the jam, but have been submitted to it anyway
 tykenn#8548: As it shows up on my windows machine, it's not compressed or anything, just a folder name, but if that extension is recognized by mac as something special I guess I shouldn't mess with it and instead just put in in another folder.
 Scolon#4218: Ok I'm submitting, I'll use whatever time I have left afterwards for additional content
But I'm setting up my page now
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: cool thanks for the info
 Zayn#4390: ok
 swarm#1128: just to nitpick, MIT license does not prevent the work to be resold. You want something like CC non-profit
 SlamBamActionman#7160: 
 Pyth0n#0572: the idea of a fps where a dice roll gives you a random gun just popped into my head, then i realised thats already been made and its on roblox XD
 GameWin221#1648: I can't upload any photos and screenshots to my game page, do you know why?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: these 2 days have been such a journey even if what i made is not super impressive. jams are always excellent ways to pick apart your game development habits and to find new directions to improve. last jam i learned that unity is too much for me and this jam i learned that there's way way way more i can learn to develop games faster and smarter
 SlamBamActionman#7160: As I understand it, an .app is like a .zip of the game itself and should contain all game content. Someone might be able to give a better answer though.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: **Please remember to submit your game to the jam, just uploading it to itch isn't enough**
Cheat sheet about launching a game on itch but also super importantly the last step of adding the game to the game jam
 tykenn#8548: I know nothing about Mac but I want to try to get this right. Instead of putting it in the folder I made, Unity generated a new folder "TheMultiverseRoom_Mac.app" and put everything in there. Is that folder all I need to upload? And is it better to zip that up into a ".app.zip", or to put that in another folder and zip that? (Windows upload went fine, just trying to add more support now)
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Itch has not crashed its just slow with images that are not important, You can make your page pretty later. Once your game is uploaded to itch please leave the website to allow everyone else to upload their games
 Tapu#9161: time to choose a better color pallete
 Redline#7370: hellu
 CFHM#9742: HI REDLINE ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
 Redline#7370: ah CFHM you in this jam too?
 Pyth0n#0572: The decent has begun.
 CFHM#9742: signs up are always higher than submissions though. think there might be a higher submission percentage than last year?
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: The theme of all GMTK Gam Jam
 OrangoMango#0973: will there be troubles uploading a game in the 2h grace period?
 sendhelpidfk#6700: 2 more levels left to design and i'm done
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: not quite, last year was more people
 Someone’s Shadow#9470: Im so nervous, and still developing the game, might not make it
 skejeton#5788: classic itch.io during gmtk.. 3rd or 4th time in a row :P
 swarm#1128: Once you have uploaded your game try to wait until the jam ends to set up your front page
 Pyth0n#0572: wait, did we not break the record?
 qxt2019#6669: Yay my game got a review :)
 OrangoMango#0973: 732 are playable on browser and 521 on windows ok..
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: Downwell's Dual Purpose Design?GENRE but NO MECHANIC,Only One,Out of control,Joined toghether,Roll of the Dice
 Valkyrrii#3264: man my bet on itch crashing was 3 hours till :p
 qxt2019#6669: Lol
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Yes everyone is having trouble with their cover art. There are 21 THOUSAND people singed up to this jam. Please be patient
 SomeTingOdd#8346: lol
 sendhelpidfk#6700: it begins
 Mark Brown#6982: Itch.io is having issues with uploading images - they are aware and will attempt to fix. Don't worry - you an still upload images to your page after submissions shut.
 Speakers#5084: itch slow for anyone else?
 nicompany#4718: what images?
 Reptilian135#9436: final 5 hrs good luck everybody
 Techsposure#0327: yes
 skejeton#5788: oh shoot
 SomeTingOdd#8346: yeah, me and a lot of other people are having issues uploading images
 Pyth0n#0572: another takeaway: i should really use unity
 tykenn#8548: Sounds like we all are
 qxt2019#6669: Okay then idk the solution
 skejeton#5788: is anyone having trouble with setting the cover art for their game?
 bird uwu#4471: godot
 SomeTingOdd#8346: absolutely lol, the time window to not just come up with something but to finish it AND make it fun is insane
 qxt2019#6669: What engine
 Pyth0n#0572: coming into the end of the jam, i have a new level of respect for the people that win
 z_richman#7356: Must be the server
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Only one person has to upload and submit the game
 SomeTingOdd#8346: probably just a server issue then right? and I'm pretty sure we're allowed to edit the itch pages themselves after submissions end, if a mod could confirm that though id appreciate it
 codeDvk#7886: how do teams upload their work?
 bird uwu#4471: ehh my itch is stuck on loading game for first time this sucks
 tykenn#8548: Yeah, I tried updating the cover art and it just keeps hanging forever
 SomeTingOdd#8346: yeah same here, they wont load in
 z_richman#7356: Having issues uploading images to Itch. Anyone else seeing this?
 Snakey-Studios#6342: yeah otherwise server will go down
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: **Please remember to submit your game to the jam, just uploading it to itch isn't enough**
Cheat sheet about launching a game on itch but also super importantly the last step of adding the game to the game jam
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Remember! try to get your game in by 6PM BST to avoid the rush!
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: No you can't.
 Hederlunden#3231: i dont even have an idea yet
 Snakey-Studios#6342: but you can use that 2 hours to work on your game not recommended tho, very bad idea since you need it to upload your game
 Lunar#4998: ohh okay
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: *2 hours
 Lunar#4998: holy i fell asleep on accident , but okay there's 4 hours and 42 minutes left
 Merus#7019: you have two hours, _included in the timer_, to get everything up on itch
 Merus#7019: jam ends in 3 hours, submissions lock when the timer runs out
 qxt2019#6669: In my game you life inside a dice that you control with various buttons but the gameplay is boring because you roll arround in a forest would have be way cooler if you floated in space
 Casterra#7763: Jam ends when the countdown ends
 NicoBobBison#6237: Does the jam end in 3 or 5 hours? I'm still confused about the grace period
 Snakey-Studios#6342: its sucks very badly
 Jyudan#1234: congrats!
 OrangoMango#0973: time to level design
 Casper#6361: Seem to happen every time
 TheChronicPhenix#1205: 38 hours of dev work later and my project is almost actually a game, can I get the win/lose conditions in before the time runs out? The race is on
 Casterra#7763: What is it?
 qxt2019#6669: Nice
 Snakey-Studios#6342: LEZZ GO FINALLY GOT IT DONE, I CAN GO TO SLEEP NOW
 Acu1000#5560: Last 3 hours of the jam and only now all the bugs show up
 Galactum#6235: i like how i JUST added the main mechanic of my game with 3 hours to spare... yeah im screwed arent i
 qxt2019#6669: Nooo i just got an idea that would have been similar to my game but actually fun :(
 Scolon#4218: Ok, i'm making my title screen now
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: You can change the look and the description of your game after the jam finishes but you will not be able to change the files after the submission time ends until the voting is over
 Casper#6361: Yup
 nicompany#4718: sorry?)
 zeidXD#0210: oh alright ,ty guys   
 Mark Brown#6982: A week!
 Sir Everard#1198: Is anyone else having trouble uploading images to itch? All my images are showing as broken links
 Mark Brown#6982: correct. Though you cannot upload builds to other places and then link to them in the description/comments - that will see your game being disqualified
 nicompany#4718: yea
 zeidXD#0210: will i have time to vote for games after the submissions ?
 DustoTail#9659: remember to have breaks in between. dont wanna get burnt out
 OrangoMango#0973: we can change everything but not the build right?
 qxt2019#6669: I cant go on my pc anymore because of my parents is it okay if i record a song with my guitar and upload it aswell to the itch.io page and you guys just pretend that the song is in the game ?
 SomeTingOdd#8346: good luck to you! :>
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: oh after this i'm going to join all of the seven day jams i can to train. i can't expect to get top 1500 like i did before starting if i don't practice. i'm gonna practice practice practice
 Mark Brown#6982: yes!
 Redline#7370: it's not the game files so yes
 BadPiggy#5202: Can I change the cover gif for the game after the jam ?
I'm not sure if it's visible or not right now
 nickeljorn#6176: I'm using p5.js
 qxt2019#6669: If you use unity upload a developer build then it works, havent figured out how to make final builds work in browser myself
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: even if you don't manage to submit this year, think of it as a lesson learned for 2023!
 DustoTail#9659: maybe simple popup effect or numbers to show instead of animation?
 Teslobo#8274: Then I'd say don't beat yourself up too much about it. Jamming solo is a whole other wheelhouse
 Chris10EMX#5180: You could be skipping the dying screen and restart the game automatically. (efficiency)
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: my game? yeah
 SomeTingOdd#8346: aw :( what was your idea? (I promise not to spend the remaining 3 hours stealing it and creating an entirely new submission)
 nickeljorn#6176: Is anyone else stuck on the loading game for the first time page?
 Jhunter#4054: Last time I do a jam solo for a while this was so stressful lol
 Nathan W#4780: life has appeared to get in the way of this jam for me this weekend D:
Was honestly pretty proud of my idea, but definitely don’t have the time to finish it now
 qxt2019#6669: Ok
 SomeTingOdd#8346: Good luck everyone! This has been so much fun and I'm so happy to have been able to participate this year :) I can't wait to try all of your games!
 Teslobo#8274: Did you do it solo?
 Mukhavertolet#2243: ok, going back to making menus
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: all things considered this is a good result even though this jam severely knocked me off the dunning-krueger peak of stupidity lmao
 Mukhavertolet#2243: don't worry guys, you'll be alright. Make the most important things first and don't stress much
 JuliusCube#8501: im practically done, (somehow) but im gonna playtest it with some people and im gonna bugfix some stuff and then im gonna fully submit my game
 qxt2019#6669: It sucks
 BadPiggy#5202: Could anyone tell me if the cover gif of my game is visible on the submission page ?
The game is stompey dicey
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: There are 3 hours remaining. Get your core mechanics finished and get your game uploaded so you have time to test it
 SomeTingOdd#8346: good! Just about done with mine, it's not great but im still really proud of it considering this is my first game jam and i was able to finish my project in time :)
 Galactum#6235: the previous message i sent should give you idea that it's not going great for me lol
 Hederlunden#3231: so much to do, very little time, stressed as hell
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: about to be done - i just need to make it so when the player dies they actually go to a game over screen and to add a "you win!" screen.
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: the programmer sent me a gif of the game working as intended omg, I’m so relieved
 Nobody6502#8971: can the admins on my itch page submit the game or do I need to
 Teslobo#8274: We strongly recommend putting pencils down at that point
 Galactum#6235: is there anything wrong with using the last 2 hours to work on the game if it's unfinished
 Mukhavertolet#2243: how's your games?
 Mukhavertolet#2243: well, i have done eveything interesting. now's the time for boring stuff
 qxt2019#6669: If my game has no audio because i didnt have enough time add audio i say i made the audio myself or not ?
 BadPiggy#5202: Oh, didn't know that channel opened up lol
My mistake
 hatoving#4710: already did so that's good lol
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Sorry, no game links outside  !
 Chris10EMX#5180: I will and I appreciate it.

Cheat sheet about launching a game on itch but also super importantly the last step of adding the game to the game jam
 Alex Silva#8787: Ooh, that's great. Tell us when u upload it, this year I'm here just to play
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: snake i guess
 Super#7038: I would have to rework all of the animation for that.
 Pyth0n#0572: roll a die, guess the number?
 Snakey-Studios#6342: ahhh guys please its almost time for me to go to sleep, what is a very simple game
 Chris10EMX#5180: Almost done as well
 Redline#7370: close to being finished, but still want to add a couple more features
 Chris10EMX#5180: You could make them use proximity attacks instead of anything complicated
 shuhai#8582: Is it right to add meta and Psychological Horror to the game?
 Alex Silva#8787: heey guys, how it's going?
 Super#7038: The enemys ai doest function at all, the enemy spawns in and just floats in the air and does noting
 Teslobo#8274: if gameplay exists you've done better than the majority of entrants and ought to show it off imo
 Chris10EMX#5180: Don't tap out yet, Just have something that a player could play even if it is buggy
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: I submitted something, and I learned alot, so I see it as a win 🙂
 Teslobo#8274: I would recommend uploading it regardless unless it is literally not playable
 Super#7038: Im giving up, there are only a few hours left and my game is extremely buggy and unfinished.
 Tapu#9161: i still don't have a single sprite in my game
 Danny Dan Dan#6699: record a video of you rolling dice a bunch of times and have players guess the result lol
 Teslobo#8274: As we approach 5 hours remaining, a reminder that there will be no allowances for late submissions. Leave yourself at least an hour to ensure your game is uploaded and entered.
 shuhai#8582: speedrun game dev
 iwonek101#1251: Speedrun GameJam any% world Record
 Tapu#9161: activate superfast game jam mode
 OrangoMango#0973: 👍
 BatYaggy#3015: speedrun game dev
 Chris10EMX#5180: Doesn't always have to be a bug could be a feature
 Dodo#8091: god, havent started yet, im skipping this jam I think
 Fnessa#8531: wtf is it with game jam games and bugs that randomly appear and disappear? in my last game there was a bug for a short time that allowed the player to double jump, which was unintended, and now i sometimes have a bug where my mouse sensitivity is higher while jumping. then i ignore it and do something different, and it just disappears again.
 OrangoMango#0973: It's mostly outdated, I have it in Program Files/Java
 RVcord#2222: anyone writing their game in assembly?
 Michel#2879: oh really what is its path
 JesusSVasquez#1009: Well, I finished and uploaded my game. Time to sleep now. GL guys. Don't forget to upload the game! few hours remaining
 Michel#2879: If window auto-install and update Java it would be a bless for java devs
 OrangoMango#0973: The JRE it's always pre installed as it's used also to run other things, the delevelopment kit no
 Sappir#7051: 5 hours left!
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Make sure you submit your game to the jam. Simply uploading it to itch is not enough
 Peewi#8572: Windows does not come with Java pre-installed
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: you zip the files together
Cheat sheet about launching a game on itch but also super importantly the last step of adding the game to the game jam
 vanderrich#9982: wooo submitted
 Shimp#0064: btw do i upload a zip file or just game files
 adrenalyzed#5024: finally submitted my game! i have school tomorrow so im heading off goodluck to all of you
 OrangoMango#0973: java it's pre-installed
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: check your game it will say if it's submitted on the top right of the game page
 OrangoMango#0973: I will wrap the jar in an exe with launch4j
 Peewi#8572: technically a .jar would be against the rules as that would need additional software to run
 Michel#2879: are you uploading the jar file or an exe file
 OrangoMango#0973: nice
 Michel#2879: oh nice another java dev out there.
 OrangoMango#0973: java
 iwonek101#1251: well i learned that i hate making UIs...
 Michel#2879: wow, which language?
 swarm#1128: congrats :)
 sendhelpidfk#6700: good advice for the future but it's already 6:46am and if i sleep now i'm not waking back up in time to submit
 Phoenix Indie#9754: One more level to go, then I can finally build and submit this mess
It’s a glorified prototype with no good art or effects, I got no sleep last night, but I’m going to actually finish a game jam for once
 unlessgames#7246: The trick to pulling all nighters is to get familiar with napping ~1.5 hour (aka 1 sleep cycle) to reboot, it makes a big difference compared to an actual all nighter ;)
 nibbbble#2399: no its alright, maybe i could rush the camera shake too 🤔
 JuliusCube#8501: im pretty sure camera shake is the only thing that has made me get top 10 in game design in a brackeys jam, camera shake is the most impactful game feel thing imo.
 Shimp#0064: guys, i submit my game but im unsure now if i sent the right one, how can i see what i submited?
 hierophant#1464: ya that sucks
 Joe Mcdermott#9590: Yes.
 OrangoMango#0973: good question, I think so
 rende#8526: Haha sorry if it makes you feel better my game is about as vanilla is it can get when it comes to juice
 nibbbble#2399: oh great, now that you mention game feel my brain is now nagging me to add slight camera shake on top of all the things i need to do rn lmao
 OrangoMango#0973: I have almost forgotten
 WorkingJoe#4433: Can you update the submission page with non-game things afterwards? Like screenshots, text etc.?
 BanananaMonke#3591: Nah
 OrangoMango#0973: Just remember about camera shake
 BanananaMonke#3591: Yep I got 10 build errors (because my pc doesn’t have python or something)
 Lemon#7606: Literally me right now. I've been awake for 23 hours and can't wait to be done and go to bed lmao
 MrRedShark77#2280: please help me how?
 rende#8526: How important is game feel? My game is done but it doesnt really got any juice.
 hierophant#1464: very time i try to publsh html5 it crys and brakes down that an the CEO and i keep geing werid bugs when i make classes
 Casterra#7763: I always do this too. Then I scramble trying to make it work in the last hours of the jam
 sendhelpidfk#6700: if at least one person plays my game i'll call that a win
 MrRedShark77#2280: "How does your game fit the theme?" i don't understand
 Lemon#7606: I decided to leave my most important mechanics for last so I have no idea if my game is fun or not beyond my imagination
 sendhelpidfk#6700: i am never pulling an all nighter again, mostly just shocked that this is my first time ever doing that
 BanananaMonke#3591: Yea I get that I am done with everything(my brain)
 hierophant#1464: well i think what ever i have made im calling done allso i think im done with unity
 BanananaMonke#3591: I don’t have gamefeel
 davidnjihiahere#6326: level design time. My favorite time
 Danny Dan Dan#6699: I decided I'm gonna forgo trying to add sound and custom graphics because I've never done that in Unity before and this probably isn't the time to learn
 E0115F 101#2073: Yea, audio an make a game feel just a slight bit more polished
 DustoTail#9659: at least some audio for simple interacting (like when clicking)
 Acu1000#5560: I could actually
 Taccos#1054: i like that.
i was going with "Lucky Attributes" and i think i might fuse the names
 JuliusCube#8501: it can be okay without any audio, but its really not that hard to go into bfxr and get some basic sounds working
 E0115F 101#2073: Could you not make some really quick sounds rn?
 Acu1000#5560: You guys think a puzzle game could be fine without any audio?
 Acu1000#5560: Overroll
 Danny Dan Dan#6699: Overclock (maybe stylized). You gain benefits and detriments from overclocking your robot cpu or smth
 Ahnaf30e#3408: rotradek
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: Shooting Dices
 Scolon#4218: I'm submitting in 2 hours
 vanderrich#9982: i want to sleep but i cant 😭
 Taccos#1054: need name pls.
my game:
3d high movement fps game sci fi settings where at the start of each level you get 1 random power and 1 random weakness.
ping me in replies pls
 DustoTail#9659: Didnt participate this time due to another jam overlapping, but best of lucks to everyone!
 Merus#7019: not here, please:  or 
 GavRaz#6261: you guys have fun with your crunching game dev and ill be sure to play it! best of luck!
 Michel#2879: I was wondering what I should put in the game description
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: you mean 3:30 hours left? nuh. no presure
 Danny Dan Dan#6699: Good morning everyone! Let's finish this strong!
 Mark Brown#6982: Yes
 TiroFueguito#0756: i just upload my game to itchio, if I submit my game to the jam, can I still edit the game page? to add images and descriptions
 Mark Brown#6982: NAO
 Mark Brown#6982: Submission time is part of the clock - it runs for 50 hours, consider the first 48 to be game dev, last 2 to be submission (though you can submit at any time)
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: oh no
 Ceding Tree#1081: Bro, I am so close to being done, but I'm feeling that time pressure HAAAARRDDD
 THE T VIRUS#2754: I'm done and about to go crash 😄
 Hippo#6071: I finished my game! Gotta know your limits.
 photodiode#9634: I am! 😄
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Unfortunately we can't really trust people with the ability to link images everywhere, we've gotten a LOT of gross stuff spam in previous years
 BadPiggy#5202: I'm done, though I'm deciding when to actually submit lol
 Mark Brown#6982: spam, yes - NSFW images and other stuff random discord users may wish to post, no
 Casterra#7763: Ya theres 2 hours
 JuliusCube#8501: how many people here are somehow done with their game?
 GavRaz#6261: alright guys, cya next year cus i am peacing out of this jam for brighter futures!
 CadenJO [DM to trade ratings]#2365: is there a submission hour?
 Michel#2879: yeah but that chat is for spam i think. It should be allowed
 Veqsa#8120: Bro watch me saying “in scared of falling asleep” some hours ago… it happend
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: You're not a patron
 softmagic#9999: there's now Windows, Mac and Linux builds 🙂
 Michel#2879: why we can't attach files in 
 Snakey-Studios#6342: i got an idea the dinosaur game
 Veqsa#8120: NOO i fell asleep
 softmagic#9999: alright, sorry!
 Merus#7019: sorry  not even patrons get to post game links outside of  (or  )
 Mark Brown#6982: yep, just keep updating the game until submissions lock at 20:00 BST
 Relis#1309: thanks!
 nekotheasparagus#0809: "guess the number"?
Just need an rng and buttons with a number that could be the answer.
 softmagic#9999: good call, i'll do that!
 Acu1000#5560: yes
 Snakey-Studios#6342: could you add a downlodable version? for some reason whenever i play any browser game on itch it just shows blank(if anyone has a fix for that please tell me)
 GavRaz#6261: yeah ill retract
 Relis#1309: guys i'm new to gamejams, can you edit and re-submit your entry before the end if you want to make some changes? sorry if its a stupid question
 MrRedShark77#2280: can i set access to public?
 nekotheasparagus#0809: I wouldn't go with this. Submit, show what you did in 48 hours (but if someone doesn't feel comfortable submitting that's their choice, but saying as a broad rule eeryone shouldn't isn't really that good
 GavRaz#6261: me and my pal's problem is is that we had so much to do if we tried to deliver it would be so not done you could tell
 Vabenil#5485: Broken game is better than no game
 Merus#7019: if you've ever had the experience of cooking and the food comes out not quite how you wanted and the people you're cooking for go NOM NOM NOM, it is very like that
 Snakey-Studios#6342: guys what is an easy game to make, something like pong or snake i need 1 more minigame
 Vabenil#5485: Yeah even if you submit something broken you will still be able to fix it after the jam end and people may still appreciate your idea
 vanderrich#9982: my game is currently shit
should i submit it
 Snakey-Studios#6342: i swear if i cant submit because of it
 Merus#7019: the audience isn't going to be able to tell the difference between what you wanted to do, and what you actually delivered
 GavRaz#6261: i mean yeah a bit
 Snakey-Studios#6342: AHHHHH, the last 10% is hurting my head
 Merus#7019: I would disagree with this - jam games are bound to be unpolished and a bit rough
 GavRaz#6261: nah
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: #YOLO submit anyways. :p
 Vabenil#5485: if I cut scope anymore than I already did there will be no game 😂
 Borbito#0304: ^ This
 Vabenil#5485: 3 to 5
 Zayn#4390: How many levels should I make? every level lasts for about 1 minute??
 Snakey-Studios#6342: yes, im having extreme amounts of trouble with it, also do you mean 10%?
 GavRaz#6261: Just realized 5 hours aint enough time for the core mechanics, feeling good because of a rewrite coming very soon to a nonexistent gmtk jam chat near you!
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: We've already cut scope. We're just trying to implement everyone's work atm. There's so much shit to integrate still..
 Merus#7019: but then it's the other 90% of the project that'll get you
 Merus#7019: I think you mentioned that you were 90% done, so it sounds like you scoped properly
 Snakey-Studios#6342: my game scope is already smaller then my sanity
 Zayn#4390: what???
 Merus#7019: start triage: what do you absolutely _need_, what will be _good_, what can you live _without_
 MrBen#0001: send me the link 👀
 Vabenil#5485: Let's break itch.io!
 Peewi#8572: I do think it's preferable to have a menu, but I wouldn't have bothered if I didn't have one I could use from a previous project
 E0115F 101#2073: Just uploaded, feeling good!
 bird uwu#4471: yay my whole game works !!!
 Merus#7019: if you can't finish in 3 hours, start cutting scope
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Ah, okay.
 GavRaz#6261: but its okay me and my pal had fun, thats all that matters and the hard work we have of the jam game will live on further in a v2 full rewrite in our own time! and we'll have even more fun there! so its alright we didn't make it. it's our first jam and sometimes the ball bounces that way
 MrRedShark77#2280: i finished my game development :D i gonna create new project!
 Julien#2204: That's what I'm doing
 Snakey-Studios#6342: why do you want that
 Merus#7019: no more changes
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: What's code lock?
 Peewi#8572: if you don't have the time, you don't NEED a menu. Plenty of gamejam games just drop you right into it
 Merus#7019: so _please_ reach code lock in 3.5 hours
 Snakey-Studios#6342: oh god, i just realized, i also need to make a main menu
 Merus#7019: 3hrs 38m until the jam ends, 2 hours after that for submissions, extra time if itch goes down, but after that, that's _it_
 Vabenil#5485: Oh you are right sorry, there's still 5 hours
 Aledrite#4274: MGR soundtrack really helps with motivation
 MihaiZ#3304: I had to submit my game yesterday because I had to leave xDD
 kcorb#6614: no its 5 hours (2 hours for subs)
 Julien#2204: Isn't it until 21? This year it's 50 hours
 Vabenil#5485: And I still don't have my main functionality or dice implemented 😂
 GavRaz#6261: also kinda bad organization kinda led to that outcome, 5 hours aint enough time lmao
 Snakey-Studios#6342: really?
 ChipmunkDev#1808: shut up
 Vabenil#5485: It's actually 3 hours
 Julien#2204: Neither is mine. I basically changed the main mechanic halfway through, I'm a masochist 😆
 L3mmy♡#2307: GameRoll ?
 Snakey-Studios#6342: "plenty of time" 5 hours but yeah still keep trying
 Aledrite#4274: :0
my game idea  prevents me from making procedural things
 Snakey-Studios#6342: basically its a mixture of pong snake and asteroids, every time you lose, you have to "roll the dice" to get another game
 Zayn#4390: dont give up, theres plenty of time left!
 ChipmunkDev#1808: that's why i randomly generated mine >:D
 L3mmy♡#2307: What's your game about ?
 GavRaz#6261: but hey we tried really well, and we had fun. isnt that all the matters? if we were to submit, it would be rough around the edges and not polished, quite frankly, it would suck.
 Snakey-Studios#6342: someone help me with my title
 ChipmunkDev#1808: I'll add +1 Ill tell you tthat!
 YaBoiHammad#1204: funi name
 L3mmy♡#2307: Name it X.COM for funny points
 Aledrite#4274: trying to make good levels quickly is stressful
 Snakey-Studios#6342: keep trying theres time left
 Cletus2000#0709: Sure, this last hours gonna be wild
 Zayn#4390: ofcourse he does lmao
 GavRaz#6261: im leaving the jam actually :( me and my pal didnt have enough time sadly. but were gonna be doing a v2 rewrite in our free time!
 YaBoiHammad#1204: More games will be submitted to this year's jam than 2021's jam
 Merus#7019: Mark wants numbers go up
 Zayn#4390: hi mark lol
 Snakey-Studios#6342: no way its mark
 Snakey-Studios#6342: oh yeah i dont blame you anymore
 Mark Brown#6982: More games have been submitted to this year's jam than 2018's jam. Keep 'em coming!
 ChipmunkDev#1808: Yeah, I'm also not using a game engine, just rust and macroquad so...
 Zayn#4390: I have around 5 percent to finish lmfao, but also dont give up 🙂 you will finish it!
 Snakey-Studios#6342: oh compared to that my game is extremely simple
 Zayn#4390: Ok guys just need to make a few more levels and then its submitting time!
 ChipmunkDev#1808: not that complex, randomly generated 2d platformer, where you can donate coins to boost karma when rolling for xp
 Snakey-Studios#6342: sheesh this is my first game jam and this was my only day to do things i still have more progress then you, how advanced is your game? like how
 SleepyJeff#9492: Got it, thank you!
 vladdeSV#6969: this is my approach. the goal is that all games should have at least 1 rating :) (and preferably more than that)
 Kritical#4329: There IS one level, the game is playable its most of the shitty stuff thats left like effects n UI n menus n stuff
 Fusoy#6101: In the itch.io page at least. You may not have time to implement a proper credit menu
 ChipmunkDev#1808: well, suddenly my character is phasing through walls and im 45% done so you can have comfort in that
 Snakey-Studios#6342: dont worry, if you arent able to submit ill still play your game
 Michel#2879: as I say to everyone. Lower youe expectations if u start running out of time. Making one playable level is better than 10 levels you can't play
 Zayn#4390: 88% done with my game yay
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: you should really think about cutting stuff. what _really_ needs to be in the game
 Superslim#7808: StrateDice!
 Kritical#4329: That doesnt make me feel better
 Snakey-Studios#6342: oh god, i have around 15%
 Kritical#4329: I still have 50% of my game left....
 Michel#2879: what about lucky xcom . lucky stats. l
 Superslim#7808: I was thinking that too but I felt like I'd be one of 1000 with the same title
 Michel#2879: Lucky roll
 Hippo#6071: Just uploaded my game. =)
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: people will specifically go through the games with the least ratings towards the end of the rating period
 Superslim#7808: Yall I still DO NOT have a game title! I made an XCOM like game but all your and enemy stats are dice rolled every turn. Title ideas?
 USER#8646: Oh ok thanks
 Michel#2879: Raters are usually trying tons of quick games they are probably gonna stumble through yours. You can also put it on 
 Sappir#7051: o_O
 q1#3172: what do you use o_o
 bird uwu#4471: ehhjh gotta love having like 6h left in the jam and have a bug that u dunno whats going on and no ones responded to ur ask for help in the engine discord lol. maybe im just too impatient lmao
 USER#8646: I mean its my first game and its not really exiting so idk why anyone would click on it but maybe someone tries it
 Michel#2879: my axis are just dices lmao
so you technically play with mouse
 OrangoMango#0973: I like it
 Michel#2879: yeah ive already downlaod plenty of games
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: you will definitely get less plays, but at the same time it's not like anybody ends the review period with zero ratings. you'll get some people
 Snakey-Studios#6342: most people are nice and will try, but its better to be safe then sorry
 Sappir#7051: your axis uses  joystick button # for your button  in the settings, right?
 Fusoy#6101: Yes. With the itch.io launcher it's easy to download games
 USER#8646: Most likely No one will play my game so it shouldn't matter lol
 q1#3172: i will :)
 nekotheasparagus#0809: "Dice it up"?
 OrangoMango#0973: Are people going to download games if they don't have a web build?
 Merus#7019: side dish?
 Snakey-Studios#6342: if your playing itch, your gonna have acess to a mouse and keyboard
 Michel#2879: most people are going to play on PC, so I don't think
 GuyWithTime#7852: Eat or die or something like that
 Merus#7019: controller support is not required! as per the jam rules, you have to support m+kb but controller support is optional
 Snakey-Studios#6342: anyone got name ideas for my name
 USER#8646: My game is based on clicking and dragging so idk how to
Maybe if i have time
 OrangoMango#0973: it's a platformer about food where you are a dice and get special effects based on your moves
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: no but if you want
 GuyWithTime#7852: If you want to but its not a must
 Michel#2879: I think Unity should have an input Library that supports asdw, arrows, controllers and adds controller buttons on mobile
 nekotheasparagus#0809: What's it about? I can try to help ^-^
 USER#8646: Wait should i have controller support?
 OrangoMango#0973: I don't know how to call my game 😂
 Snakey-Studios#6342: i have too much free time lol, im sure people will play my game if thats the case
 USER#8646: Yeat since itch also has a lot of just players
 Michel#2879: i am not get axis in my jam game but yes I usually use raw
 OrangoMango#0973: jam
 Snakey-Studios#6342: is this only for jams or itch in general?
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: me: I will not put in my game name "dice"
game's name: Haunted Dices
 USER#8646: I just finished my mvp
 Sappir#7051: It doesn't? But we got joycontroller tool tips and stuff? Are you using the raw?
 ChipmunkDev#1808: I'm not sure if I'm going to finish I don't even have a mvp yet
 USER#8646: Technically they are just 2 extra hours you can do whatever but its worded differently so people have time to submit
 IamAdil#4791: yesterday we lost our half progress, thanks to unity xD
 OrangoMango#0973: yeah simply review other games and people will review yours
 (유)니티 좋음/나찰 니티#7281: Yeah, 2  hours to submit
 farkon00#0500: Thanks to mark for asking did i make sound effects while the jam. I forgot to make them and already started making build.
 Sappir#7051: Oh good. I can sleep lol
 GuyWithTime#7852: (Technically 4)
 USER#8646: Can others play the games during the review time
 MangoWorks#1202: im going to at least try to review 100 games
 Michel#2879: I wonder why unity's get axis method doesn't support controllers
 Scolon#4218: a week
 (유)니티 좋음/나찰 니티#7281: 6 hours 0 minutes 0 seconds left
 Sappir#7051: How long do we have to review other games?
 Scolon#4218: Getting reviews is mostly from being active and playing other peoples' games
If you just submit and forget it is unlikely you'll get a large number
 SlamBamActionman#7160:  , and also don't use caps
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: does the game page have 'submission to gmtk 2022 jam' on it
 Sappir#7051: Someone is making controller support?!
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: guy can you check if my game is submitted ?
 Snakey-Studios#6342: after the jam ends am i allowed to advertise my game for ratings?
 Pyth0n#0572: cant wait till ive submitted this game and i can play pokemon without feeling guilty
 Zayn#4390: XD
 Snakey-Studios#6342: honestly i dont care if i get the lowest ranking, as long as someone plays my game ill be happy
 Zayn#4390: its just game jam humor 😄 and thanks lmao
 MangoWorks#1202: same for me but its opposite
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Most games get at least a few reviews! You'd be surprised!
 Snakey-Studios#6342: i had a very simple idea no ones gonna play my game lol
 imperial fool#2315: man the last hours are always so intense
 Redline#7370: me when trying to make enemies
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: I'm done with the core gameplay, but I have to add stuff. I will work till the end. And now I will send a early version for bug fixing
 IamAdil#4791: that's odd, cuz i never had any issues with it
 Zayn#4390: Time to make levels. and kill myself lmfao
 skejeton#5788: latest stable
 MangoWorks#1202: there's always somebody who snipes the jam the last second with an empty project
 IamAdil#4791: which version u using??
 Redline#7370: I'm nerfing regen to the ground holy shit it's so OP
 skejeton#5788: i'm not blaming anyone, but I'm very frustrated with it. "segfaulted once, sometimes functions return wrong values, like when you disable sprite center, the get_rect function still returns centered rect, the editor ui is sometimes unclickable for no reason (happened twice)".
i'll give some time to godot for it to stabilize next time
 Snakey-Studios#6342: ok good
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Yup
 IamAdil#4791: first of all, godot is not buggy
 Snakey-Studios#6342: by some tutorials, i used github, i didnt copy and paste them, i followed along with the github page, is that allowed?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: yup
 Snakey-Studios#6342: guys are tutorials allowed? im a bit new at making games so are using tutorials allowed?
 IamAdil#4791: what bug?
 skejeton#5788: it's very frustrating since it's not the first time these bugs happen, i'll consider using love2d next time
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: we have no gameplay, just dialogue 😭 we overscoped so hard
at least the dialogue is fun
 Owen#2352: Gotcha. I'll try to reach him
 krisis in a jar#0904: Even though i already finished my game, i'm still adding some features such as controller support
 Snakey-Studios#6342: guys got any simple but retro game ideas (something like snake and pong but not space invaders) i just want something simple for my last minigame
 IamAdil#4791: huh!
 Zayn#4390:  hi
 OrangoMango#0973: ok
 Tapu#9161: 48 hour is a short time, not everyone can line up their schedule. And there are teams too
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Unfortunately I think that your partner must do the submission then. You are probably added as a contributor, and I don't think they can submit games.
 Owen#2352: It's already public, but there's no change! The page is telling me that there's no projects on my account I'm able to submit. To clarify, I'm not technically the "owner" of my game, my partner is, but he's asleep and will be for a while, so I'm trying to submit without him
 OrangoMango#0973: Because 5k out of 21k it's low, how 16k people did not submit the game?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: They don't need to, but it helps
 Snakey-Studios#6342: i dont think so
 IamAdil#4791: What u just said?!?!?!?!
 OrangoMango#0973: do people join  also if they don't make a game but they are in team?
 Snakey-Studios#6342: since i was smart this time i actually made a backup and got my code back, i actually almost started crying
 SlamBamActionman#7160: It's likely you've set it to Private or Draft atm
 SlamBamActionman#7160: You need to set your game page to public
 Woomek#4366: damn, a lot of playing to do 😄
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Sorry, 5,7k
 SlamBamActionman#7160: 2021 had around 5k submissions out of 22k participants
 BanananaMonke#3591: between 5000 and 1000 i think
 Snakey-Studios#6342: good news i got my code back
 Owen#2352: How can I submit the game as an admin? I believe that everything is ready on the game page, but when I go to submit on the Jam page itself, there's no option to select my game
 GuyWithTime#7852: my guess is at least like 5000
 SlamBamActionman#7160: 
 wumpus#3512: pretty sure Mark said it was something like 8k?
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: How to detect trigger input for unity on controllers?
 BanananaMonke#3591: lol my game has 21 Scenes
 Woomek#4366: I am curious how many games of the 21.5k are made
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: ok
 Tapu#9161: Your itch dashboard should have the game page without the game files. Click on it and go to settings. The settings should have a place for you to upload.
 Pyth0n#0572: mark's slid into my email inbox
 sushiman#4823: yea good
 Woomek#4366: ok! all clear. then i am set and done! I learned a lot of randomizing this jam lol 😄
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Basketball gun. Include that satisfying "gloink" they make when they hit the ground. Instant win.
 MrCurt#0695: i probably won't make it in time for the game jam, but it's really pushed me into (finally) jumping into godot, thanks for the push gmtk
 Woomek#4366: Yea i got that. got webGL player. But no source code needed then. I mean the folder so you can view my script
 SlamBamActionman#7160: You do not need to include the source code or project files
 sushiman#4823: who has an idea for a strange weapon like a banana gun or somting like that
 Tapu#9161: Isn't the code the game? Like you need to upload all the files in your directory
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: how
 Tapu#9161: Hey me too
 Woomek#4366: ok i just read something but i am not sure. Does the code / source / should be uploaded as well? or just the game?
 nickeljorn#6176: I'm using p5.js
 Tapu#9161: You just upload the game to the game page
 Merus#7019: if it's a webgl game in Unity, make sure you're using gzip
 Scolon#4218: You can just add your files
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: guy i accidently sulbit my game without the game in it,what can i do to rremove it ?
 nickeljorn#6176: I'm stuck on loading game for the first time
 SlamBamActionman#7160: "Click like and hit that subscribe button" sort of thing 😛
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Sure, you can always prompt people for a rating. It might be a bit cheesy though
 skejeton#5788: segfaulted once, sometimes functions return wrong values, like when you disable sprite center, the get_rect function still returns centered rect, the editor ui is sometimes unclickable for no reason (happened twice)
 vanderrich#9982: already decided on roll defense
 Ahnaf30e#3408: no like IN the game?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: We also allow people who advertise rate 4 rate, but keep game links to DMs
 KadDev#8100: what about dice defence or cash roll?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Yup! That's what  is for 🙂
 Ahnaf30e#3408: Am i allowed to ask for ratings at the end of the game? (as a joke but it might affect the ratings of people so uhh ye just askin)
 dardasaba#9759: How so?
 skejeton#5788: godot is such a buggy engine
 OrangoMango#0973: just curious, I won't do it
 Zayn#4390: 
 SlamBamActionman#7160: It's iiin the rules 😛
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Nope, you'll be disqualified
 OrangoMango#0973: Am I allowed to put an external download on the itch.io page?
 Zayn#4390: 6 hours remain in the jam ^_^
 Zayn#4390: Alright back from my 2 hour break!
 Woomek#4366: Haha i did not, i paniced that my game didnt submit correctly
 Pyth0n#0572: HOW HAVE YOU MADE TWO GAMES
 Peewi#8572: To make a Zip file in Windows, select all the files you want to include and there's a right click option for it. In Win11 it's right the in the right click menu. In previous versions it's a sub-item of "send to"
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Yup, you can submit multiple games
 Giga chad#0085: ohw ok
 Woomek#4366: Hey all, is it correct that if I already submitted my project i still can submite another project?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: It's just updating the game's page on itch.io, it should give you the option to upload new files
 SomeTingOdd#8346: sun's rising!
 Peewi#8572: You don't. You can upload zip files instead
 Giga chad#0085: I mean I already submitted but i need to update
 Pyth0n#0572: what do u guys think of the name: 'casino roll-ale'
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: how can i upload a folder in itch.io ?
 Acu1000#5560: It's up to you how you spend the remaining time. You can add more levels, fix bugs, test the game or improve visuals and so on
 JoelOfWalse#8278: Okay yeah The Illness has eaten way too much of my time, good luck to everyone else!
 Giga chad#0085: guys how to update the game to the jam
 OrangoMango#0973: I made 3 platformer levels, should I do more?
 Snakey-Studios#6342: my code for one of the minigames just stopped working, and i have no idea how to fix it
 Captain Poontang#0601: yes lol, gotta make some quick fixes now so I can continue to add content
otherwise I've just made a shitty version of pokemon lol
 vanderrich#9982: :o yesss thanks
 nicompany#4718: ужас, что за слова?)
 KadDev#8100: Dice Defence 
 Pyth0n#0572: will your players find it tho?
 nekotheasparagus#0809: Any amount is good! Nice job on 3 :D
 vanderrich#9982: ok so hjbnjdancd
 Zeta#7525: явахуе
 MangoWorks#1202: call it Roll Defense
 Captain Poontang#0601: game-breaking bugs found :((((
 Balrajjjjjj#8760: 😘
 Snakey-Studios#6342: oml im like, dead on the inside rn
 vanderrich#9982: its about tower defense but you roll the dice to get the money thing
cooldown and lag cuz im building the game sucks
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Thanks for the consideration tho ❤️
 Pyth0n#0572: my game is just going to be text on a screen
 MangoWorks#1202: what is it about im good at making names
 Teslobo#8274: Just slam your head on the keyboard tbh and save whatever it produces
 OrangoMango#0973: so it's not allowed for example to put a link in the downloads section that points to a github file? Just to know (I won't do it)
 KadDev#8100: what's it about?
 Balrajjjjjj#8760: poor mods
 vanderrich#9982: what should i call my game
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: ok
 cardy64#4627: damn
 Taccos#1054: aight all i have left is main menu, death menu and levels
 SlamBamActionman#7160: It says so in the rules and in the message in  as well
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Indeed
 Michel#2879: so I don't have to submit it again right?
 SlamBamActionman#7160:  Don't caps like that, you can ask normally.
 Teslobo#8274: I believe the page is what is technically submitted, not just the file. Updating the file shouldn't affect the entry status
 MangoWorks#1202: maybe in your randomizer one of the things it can randomize to is misspelled
 Michel#2879: I have uploaded the game to itch → submited it to the jam
but then had to update the itch page. Does that automatically apply to the jam submission or I have to submit it again
 Zeta#7525: our main character is named jelal addin
 Scolon#4218: My game is pretty much done but I'm updating with a bit of content
 Snakey-Studios#6342: yes
 MangoWorks#1202: so mario party with mario
 Snakey-Studios#6342: i have no idea, basically my game is a bunch of minigames and it randomizes which one you play
 Redline#7370: how did you manage to do that?
 FredsMeds87#3239: True! I find it hard to playtest too. Ex my buddy who was playtesting for me is self proclaimed bad at puzzle games lol so it’s hard to know if they’re too difficult. I’m gonna try to air on the side of easier.
 L3mmy♡#2307: No backups ?
 Snakey-Studios#6342: my entire project just got corrupted
 wumpus#3512: when you click export, in the "file explorer" window that pops up, there will be a checkbox in the bottom
 JuliusCube#8501: id say puzzle design is easy, *good* puzzle design is hard
 Pyth0n#0572: my game is like if blackjack and yatzhee had a kid but they were only in the womb for 48 hours
 GeoStarGames#8750: ok cya guys ima go finish my game faaasttt
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: In the new input system, my mouse click is detected but not my controllers right trigger? Even though I'm using the listen to get the exact input, its still not detecting
 Redline#7370: that's why I didn't make a puzzle game lmao
 Pyth0n#0572: tbh a game jam version is kind of like a demo, if the game is actually good, you can keep developing it
 FredsMeds87#3239: Puzzle design is hard 😫
 Redline#7370: time to add bosses and abilities I guess
 vlady.ts#4296: Game submitted! Thanks you!
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Please do not caps-lock your questions.
3 levels should be fine, what matters is a good first impression and that it's a fun time 🙂
 Acu1000#5560: You can always add more if you have spare time
 Redline#7370: oh wait there's still around 5 hours left? ah that's nice
 Karthik Krishna#7730: PLS WILL ANYONE WILL TELL THIS ISMY FIRST JAM
 Scolon#4218: Ok, it's time to finish working on my game
 GeoStarGames#8750: i am not that scared like main things are already in game soo... yea..
 MangoWorks#1202: i like that there wont be any late submissions that means we get to see what people created without pity time
 Mukhavertolet#2243: 😟
 PickleOstrich#2216: Ice cold
 Karthik Krishna#7730: HI I CREATED 3 LEVELS IS THAT FINE
 Lukey#6052: lmao
 SlamBamActionman#7160: It is
 Mukhavertolet#2243: > There will be no late submissions in 2022
that sounds like a threat
 vlady.ts#4296: Oh thanks Mango, it was draft.
 Finboror#8230: oh hi mark
 MangoWorks#1202: is the game public
 Acu1000#5560: make sure to set it as released
 vlady.ts#4296: 😰 hey someone can help me? I created a project in itchio and I've already uploaded the game, but when trying to submit the game on the Jam landing page, it tells me that I don't have any games in my account. Do you know why it could be?
 PickleOstrich#2216: Oh thank god
 Acu1000#5560: ok
 Lukey#6052: woah! hello mark!
 Mark Brown#6982:
 Mark Brown#6982: Hey! The GMTK Game Jam is coming to a close. So here’s what you need to know.
**There will be no late submissions in 2022**
Each year I’ve allowed people a “grace period”, after the end of the jam, to send their games in late. But this has been hard to apply fairly and efficiently.
So this year, that’s not happening - instead, the jam is 50 hours long  and you can use those final two hours to submit your game, check for bugs, update, and make last, last, last minute changes.
Because once the full 50 hour timer is up , submissions are closed. I repeat, closed!
**What if Itch.io goes down?**
Almost every year, Itch.io’s servers have bent with the weight and stress of so many game jammers. We’re aware of this, and will account for it - if the servers start to buckle to the point where people cannot upload their games, we will extend the duration of the jam.
You can prepare for this by submitting early! Over 1,000 people have already submitted games to the jam - be like them!
**What can I edit after that?**
You can edit your Itch.io page, by adding screenshots, logos, text, etc. But that’s about it. New uploads are locked, so you can’t change the game itself. And uploading the game / a new build elsewhere, and pointing to it in the comments or description, will see your game being disqualified.
**I’m having problems with my submission!**
The single best place to get help is the GMTK Discord . There are hundreds of friendly people there who will help you through technical troubles and upload issues.
**What happens next?**
Once the submissions are closed, the rating period begins. Over the next week you’ll be able to play games, leave feedback, and submit ratings. This helps whittle the games down to a ranked list.
I will then play the top 100 games and pick my favourites - which will be turned into a video on Game Maker’s Toolkit. Once that video goes live, the public ratings will also be revealed.
I also like to stream games after the jam ends. It’s currently a heatwave in the UK so I won’t be streaming on Monday or Tuesday, but will hopefully go live on Wednesday. Subscribe to GMTK on YouTube to get notified.
 PickleOstrich#2216: That’s a fat yikes you better get your butt off discord
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: guy how can i export my godot game without debug help guy im scared
 vlady.ts#4296: help pleasee u.u
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Having a grace period also spreads out when people submit the games, being nicer to the servers as well
 Michel#2879: oh
 Tornado#0975: congrats on having the game done
 Michel#2879: for me my lap is pretty good but my connection sucks cus......... Syria
 SlamBamActionman#7160: When the barrage of games being uploaded are involved, the things *you* have do not matter
 Tornado#0975: DDOS ITCH IO SO WE GET EXTRA TIME jk pls dont ban me
 PickleOstrich#2216: I wanted to say congrats but there was no way I could say without sounding sarcastic but genuinely congrats
 Balrajjjjjj#8760: that's assuming itch's servers dont flop
 Pyth0n#0572: this made me laugh so hard
 Soup#3034: i made itch refer to my terrible game as an "incredible experience"
 Michel#2879: depends on his computer & where he lives. If he has a good pc and good connection, building and uploading won't take time
 Tornado#0975: LOLOL start a botnet jk
 GeoStarGames#8750: OH NOOO IM NOT EVEN HALF DONE
 vlady.ts#4296: 😰 hey someone can help me? I created a project in itchio and I've already uploaded the game, but when trying to submit the game on the Jam landing page, it tells me that I don't have any games in my account. Do you know why it could be?
 Pyth0n#0572: technically, if we crash the servers, we can have extra dev time
 Tornado#0975: Yeah every YEAR the itch io servers get problems
 Michel#2879: welcome
 MrBen#0001: omg im so hyped about my game
 GeoStarGames#8750: but in itch.io it shows 13 hours? how?
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: the gmtk game jam, or as the itch backend it crew call it 'five thousand earth-shattering blows'
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Sure, but I can say with extensive experience: Use the 2 hour grace period for submitting. Don't count them as dev time.
 Acu1000#5560: It's better to not add any features in the last 2 hours so you dont break things in the last minute
 PickleOstrich#2216: Lol true
 Michel#2879: yeah he still technically got seven hours to work
 SlamBamActionman#7160: After the grace period there will be no late submissions
 PickleOstrich#2216: Yeah last year was a cluster fluck so try to upload earlier than later
 SlamBamActionman#7160: The itch.io timer counts the extra 2 hours of submission time. It's not a 50 hour jam, it's 48 hours + 2 hour grace period.
 MangoWorks#1202: am i the only one here who is using Roll of the dice as a metaphor
 Michel#2879: oh does it
 Hederlunden#3231: Hey siri, play the doom music
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Please don't say 7 hours, the jam ends in 5 😅 Don't count the grace period as jam dev time
 Sappir#7051: 6 hours and 50 minutes
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: ALRIGHT. LAST STRETCH. COFFEE, DON'T FAIL ME NOW!!!
 Michel#2879: actually you still have 7 hours go work now
having an insane hype can save you from not making it at time
 Tornado#0975: oh sry
 PickleOstrich#2216: Don’t burn yourself out but don’t quit either
 SlamBamActionman#7160:  for that kind of question
 MrBen#0001: lucky u
 Swordy#6576: I'll leave it to the end if there's time
 GeoStarGames#8750: idk walking around for half hour in park helped for me tho
 Tornado#0975: how to change the rect transform using code c# UNITY
 Pyth0n#0572: No. Fight on!
 MangoWorks#1202: i liked the theme for this year its way different from the past years
 MrBen#0001: but if it will result depression?
 GeoStarGames#8750: no giving up is worst thing ever!
 Michel#2879: don't make a ui just gameplay. It's better to lower your expections a little bit now
 Fusoy#6101: I'm filling the poll when submitting a game. Would you say the Monogame Framework falls under the "Other engine" or "No engine" category ?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: awesome! will be lovely to hang out for a little while more
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: it will be closed after mark's video comes out. it'll probably be delayed for a few days relative to last year because the weather in the uk for the next couple days is genuinely not compatible with working on anything
 Pyth0n#0572: this theme was MADE for me
 Swordy#6576: I got depression
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Until Mark has posted his video declaring the winners. So like two weeks or so
 q1#3172: i am sweating for you
 Swordy#6576: I got the basic mechanics up and running and all i have to do is(the catch of the game, ui, transition, enemies, levels) can i do them in the remaining time?
 MrBen#0001: man my cat was supporting me so much. He was bitting the microphone and playing with my cables
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: (well, the stressed out people with access to the vc)
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: questions @ the mods, actually: how long will the server (as in, the channels open to everyone) remain open to non-patrons after the deadline, if at all?
 Redline#7370: hmm catto
 MrBen#0001:
 Swordy#6576: Im loosing hope🙁
 MrBen#0001: true, true...
 Swordy#6576: Guys someone send help
 SlamBamActionman#7160: A real life dice would be hardware, but yes it's still against the rules 😛
 q1#3172: yeah a friend designed a pen and paper game, im making it virtual!
 GeoStarGames#8750: i have 8/30 done and it is 2 day
 Pyth0n#0572: i own:
DND 5e essentials kit
DND 5e PHB
DND 5e DMG
DND 5e MM
2 sets of polyhedral dice
a binder full of character sheets
 MrBen#0001: It can't require additional software
 xqrd#4298: the game is done and is submitted 😄
 cardy64#4627: wooo
 Hederlunden#3231: that wouldve made my job a lot easier
 MrRedShark77#2280: true
 q1#3172: cant believe they made the theme "roll of dice" and didnt allow tabletop games :(
 Pyth0n#0572: ok, ill rephrase, did anybody make a computer port of a game that could be played irl
 ImZary#0765: last day pals!
good luck :D
 Omegnight#7081: What's the page to see the current submissions count please?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Would be against the rules unfortunately. It needs to be a computer game!
 Acu1000#5560: I think its against the rules of the jam
 Pyth0n#0572: quick question, did anybody make a game that could just be played irl with real dice?
 Merus#7019: then take it to 
 MrBen#0001: but im SO HYPED
 SlamBamActionman#7160: That's why we say it's a 48 hour jam with 2 hour submission grace period, and not a 50 hour jam. Get your game in on time, you'll be really sad if you miss it
 cardy64#4627: valid asf solution
 Pyth0n#0572: i spent almost an entire day stuck on this one bug
my solution? DELETE THE MAIN MENU
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Nope, no late submissions this year. Hard rule this time.
 Sappir#7051: You think it will guarantee if you do it 2 hours before?
 SlamBamActionman#7160:  Stop linking to your game outside of , you keep doing it and it's a bit obvious you're just trying to get extra eyes on it 😛
 MangoWorks#1202: i could use the last 30m for that sense exporting for me only takes 20s
 Hederlunden#3231: but what if i say please
 SlamBamActionman#7160: I can't stop you, but if you miss the deadline, it's gonna be on you
 Hederlunden#3231: im gonna use them as gamedev time, i barely have the main game in place
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Because itch.io often gets a lot of load at the end of the jam. The 2 extra hours are for submitting the game, there's no guarantee you'll get your game up if you submit it the last 15 minutes.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i might use it as music making time lmao. get everything done then see if i can make a track in an hour and implement it in game. if not i just have the audio-less version
 Hederlunden#3231: you want courses to get ideas? just go on a walk or go on vacation or something, maybe do stuff out of the usual
 Tapu#9161: I'm gonna upload the game with all the art and sound done and then keep polishing last few hours and updating
 MangoWorks#1202: why?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Do not use them as gamedev time! It's a baaaad idea!
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: becuase all my game ideas are terrible, so I need something more imaginative yk
 SlamBamActionman#7160: 2 hour grace period! Remember!
 MangoWorks#1202: Were Saved By 2 Hours!
 Hederlunden#3231: why do you want full courses when you have brackeys lol, he teached me everything i need to know
 Static doodles#2251: Oh thank God I didn't procrastinate
 MangoWorks#1202: WAIT It Ends At 3PM!
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: I mean full courses
 Hederlunden#3231: I see
 Vabenil#5485: Actually there are still 7 hours
 USER#8646: POMO's are awesome
 Pyth0n#0572: sadly not untill ther's 1 hour left on the clock
 Redline#7370: *brackeys lmao*
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Anyone know more advanced free courses for making games in unity
 MangoWorks#1202: we got 4 hours
 USER#8646: Lol
 Hederlunden#3231: isnt the timer enough motivation?
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: yeah you'll get a copyright strike from john cage
 USER#8646: And technically yoe didn't create silence lol
 Pyth0n#0572: this was meant to be fun
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: does anyone have any place they can point me to to improve with godot? i feel like i need to get better at using it, i feel like i'm maybe 5/10 confident using it and want to get to an 8-9/10
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Yep
 USER#8646: Ok thanks
 Acu1000#5560: well, can I change it later?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Uuuh I suppose "no audio" is your audio lol
 Pyth0n#0572: i am using the pomodoro method for coding
 Teslobo#8274: If it's before the deadline: yes
 USER#8646: Quick question: can i upload a MVP and then re-upload
 wumpus#3512: i just scrapped the idea that was causing me problems lmao
 Acu1000#5560: What do I check on the "vast majority of music" question if I havent added any audio yet? (And I havent decided if Im going to make my own or premade)
 Tapu#9161: I'll put "I rolled in a bad Dice pun and the dice faces are the stats of the cards you get"
 MangoWorks#1202: my game has a dice card but then wasn't even part of the theme it was just a small joke to the theme the part of my teams game that fits the theme is how you roll for card at the end of each day and you have to use them to keep your robots alive
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Yea something like that
 Acu1000#5560: so like "I decided to make a game where you have to roll dice on tiles to solve puzzles"?
 MangoWorks#1202: just type what your game is based around the theme
 SlamBamActionman#7160: An explanation for how you implemented the theme in your game 🙂 Whatever your thought process was
 Iron_Lemon#6223: It got dice innit
 MangoWorks#1202: ok the last 2 important things that i have to do are Card abilities and Card Descriptions (I know menus are important but i meant gameplay things)
 Acu1000#5560: what am I supposed to type in the "How does your game fit the theme" box?
 Sappir#7051: Gnight
 Agezma#7764: I just got jumpscared by my own game while testing, and it's not even a scary game
 MangoWorks#1202: last year there was a game breaking bug in my game so i couldn't submit but this year i have hope
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Goodnight then 🙂
 Soup#3034: im putting my game on itch and then going to sleep
 Lukey#6052: I'm pretty happy with my progress so far, Unity's being a toddler and taking a long time to build (it's probably my toaster laptop's fault actually) which is the one thing annoying me right now
 Vabenil#5485: The review period will start soon, so you won't get bored
 Sappir#7051: wow, yall crazy xD. I only started 19 hours ago lol
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: It was really fun to just play games and see what creative ideas people had. Sometimes you find bugs and they thank you. It's amazing. I'm happy I could do so many of them honestly wish i could do more XD
 CodingLord#1012: Omg I give up, I have nothing
 Iron_Lemon#6223: Boutta go to breakfast for the second time today
 Mukhavertolet#2243: just woke up like an hour ago. too much time wasted
 Soup#3034: same here haha
 ChopieTheCat#5876: based
 Iron_Lemon#6223: It’s 8 in the morning here
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: I have the destruction system in place tho 🙂 At least for cubes
 Lemon#7606: I've been up for 21 hours and counting
 wumpus#3512: this single bug is driving me insane
 Soup#3034: its almost 5 am for me
 Sappir#7051: That sounds hard to implement xD
 Mukhavertolet#2243: 🎉 🎉 🎉
 Iron_Lemon#6223: Only 🥲
 Lukey#6052: I've been awake for many many hours (It's like almost midnight for me)
 MangoWorks#1202: i only got 6 hours of sleep
 BanananaMonke#3591: Bad bad bad still getting errors I can’t fix when building…
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Yes.
 cardy64#4627: bro we never went to sleep
 Mukhavertolet#2243: today's your bday?
 Iron_Lemon#6223: I been up almost a day, probably gonna sleep this afternoon^^
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Maybe the level is trying to attack you, so you gotta destroy its buildings, guns, etc. and deliver the parcel
 ChopieTheCat#5876: no im about to go to sleep after I update the itch io and submit it
 Sappir#7051: Is everyone waking up?
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I am gonna enjoy my bday. I enjoyed being here play testing and reviewing 56 games, often builds of the same game aswell. It was an amazing fun experience!
 Mukhavertolet#2243: sounds like an overkill honestly
 ChopieTheCat#5876: You got this man.
 Vabenil#5485: Motivation is dying, game not nearly ready. I still haven't given up yet
 MangoWorks#1202: did you know that polymars formed the ultimate team of like 50 people for this jam!
 Fireninja#2343: Maybe after i learn better coding ill participate in this, like next year or in 2 years.
 Sappir#7051: Depends on how much is destructible tbh. It's part of the level design.
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Settled in for the endtimes
 Redline#7370: chaos. pure chaos, but good enough
 Mukhavertolet#2243: i hope i can finish the probably hardest part today - some oponnent ai. then everything else
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Hows everyone btw?
 Teslobo#8274: check under "submitting a game"
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: huh
 Teslobo#8274: Instructions for submissions are on the itch page, linked above
 Fireninja#2343: i already used that lol
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Because some people may want to use non-thonks that are offensive. We don't want that.
 Aiminer357#8033: where can i find the link for my submission? i want to make edits
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: Guy i think i finish my game
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I know! And I'm super excited
 Fireninja#2343: also why not public emojis?
i want to use my thonks.
me got lots.
 Mukhavertolet#2243: rating period is yet to come
 Fireninja#2343: where and when is the voting?
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: I wish I could somehow implement all the ideas - like have a racing as well as delivering as well as destruction, but idk how i'd do that lol
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Heyo. My playtest/review vibes come to an end. I never knew I'd be playing this many games XD
 MrBen#0001: oh thanks!
 Mukhavertolet#2243: Hey, how's everyone doing?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Ah, I think you can get that if you click on the "Submitted to GMTK Game Jam 2022" banner on your itch.io page
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Yeah but if you have destruction, then surely the course would be easy
 Sappir#7051: I would create a obstacle course, and have red barrels in the way.
 Redline#7370: click on your profile on the top right corner of itch
 MrBen#0001: people have sumbitted inks in 
 dardasaba#9759: What do you mean with a link?
 Kemtimus SIGN#9906: Deliver packages and then enemies attack you
 MrBen#0001: I mean I want to see my game submitted with a link. How can I get it?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Once the voting period begins, you will be able to link to the submission page
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: How would you say I implement both?
 Velcro#6337: Finally submitted after spending 37 hours on this gamejam 🙏
 Sappir#7051: Delivering, lets you focus on movement. Novelty comes from flying. Plus destruction has been done a lot. You can always do both though.
 Phoenix Indie#9754: You know you’ve pulled a full all nighter when the birds start chirping
 MrBen#0001: anyone will answear me please?
 Tapu#9161: Yeah destruction is more fun but harder to implement
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: for a while yeah, but wouldn't you think destroying stuff is more satisfying? And maybe getting past some sorta secutiry / anti drone things
 BanananaMonke#3591: is anyone having trouble building webGL on Macos?
 wumpus#3512: im having a breakdown over this bug, what makes it worse is that its a main feature and is the last thing to do before the game is done lmao
 BadPiggy#5202: I wish I thought of that lol
 MrBen#0001: how do I get link to my submitted game?
 Tapu#9161: Maybe some precision flying would be fun
 Kemtimus SIGN#9906: Play Ludo by dropping the dices from the drone
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: lmao that sounds fun
 Balrajjjjjj#8760: drag a dice like a wrecking ball
 Tapu#9161: Drop bombs and watch mass destruction
 BadPiggy#5202: YEET it from the drone
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: What makes delivering stuff fun? And where you deliver it (I'm not making a super large map yk)
 Sappir#7051: I second the deliver stuff
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: I thought of destroying an area
 SomeTingOdd#8346: fly a drone
 BadPiggy#5202: Drop dice on top of people
 MangoWorks#1202: get weapons to attach to your drone
 Kemtimus SIGN#9906: Deliver stuff
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Anyone got ideas on what you could do in a drone flying game
 ChopieTheCat#5876: lets go I packaged it I can sleep its bright day outside
 Sappir#7051: Do you think anyone got a job offer from doing game jams?
 Lukey#6052: so I can stay in the discord server
 MrBen#0001: why
 Lukey#6052: damn I gotta get a job so I can buy patreon
 MrBen#0001: thanks :)
 Peewi#8572: I'll have to give it a try once I finish my own
 MrBen#0001: I AM SO PROUD OF IT
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: nice
 Sappir#7051: Personally I believe that most people don't work at full capacity and when they drink enough caffeine and have enough determination, they start to fill that capacity;
 Lukey#6052: ~ Universe Caffeine ~
 MangoWorks#1202: usually i just have milk
 BadPiggy#5202: I had a bit of coffee today morning lol
 Redline#7370: I only had a cup of black tea in the morning
 Casper#6361: The second day is always a bit of a slump for me
 MrBen#0001: true
 Zutilt10 | Jonathan. W#0339: Guess I'm not a game developer yet then
 Lukey#6052: 100% convinced that all game developers have the ability to slow time when provided with enough caffeine and determination.
 Redline#7370: we become the game
 MangoWorks#1202: i hate coffee
 Casper#6361: It surprising how much you get done once your in a flow
 BadPiggy#5202: Fr
 MangoWorks#1202: for some reason when GMTK jam starts time slows down x10
 Lukey#6052: I honestly don't know. Coffee and magic I guess
 Zutilt10 | Jonathan. W#0339: How do people make these things in 48 hours seriously
 SlamBamActionman#7160: I really hope some more people end up joining in at the last second, like team members and stuff like that
 SlamBamActionman#7160: We're like 500 people from beating last year's participant number
 Aiminer357#8033: thank you, i'll look into that
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: set the compression to gzip in the player settings. brotli is broken on itch
 Casper#6361: WebGL is pain
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: it won't load. that's how the compression issue manifests, just sticks forever
 Aiminer357#8033: im using webGL on itch.io and it seems to be taking forever to load. anyone know why? if i build it for windows its fine
 Omegnight#7081: Well, I'm finished. Just a few more polishing on the itch.io page now
 ChopieTheCat#5876: I just really hope its playable if it launches then im fine like if nothing works thats coolio as long as it opens the main menu im good to go to sleep lmao
 Casper#6361: My priorities are bit scuffed so I did most of the polish already
 Casper#6361: I just need to finish the main questline
 ChopieTheCat#5876: oh my god its actually packaging after having to install 3 random things and fix bugs and wow look at all those errors
 MrBen#0001: yes! Im uploading my game finally
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: i need to set a reminder to post that at the right time
 Merus#7019: it also made me do a double take, but that's because I've been playing The Stanley Parable this afternoon
 ChopieTheCat#5876: yeah thats why i was scared when you say 1:50 lmao
 Sappir#7051: we still got 7 hours and 40 ish minutes left
 ChopieTheCat#5876: hu-what
 Sappir#7051: that 1:50:61 made me do a double take lol
 wumpus#3512: the settings is basically just controller remapping and volume lmao
 HesmmM#1805: lol gl i started today
 ChopieTheCat#5876: imagine not just putting "sorry I ran out of time there are no settings lol" in your settings menu smh
 wumpus#3512: I basically only need to add a settings menu, do the final polish and im good
 ChopieTheCat#5876: Ive never exported a game before and ive been up for 24 hours on 6 hours of sleep lmao
 Redline#7370: do it after the jam lol
 BadPiggy#5202: Aight.
I'm finished with my entry then
 GodOfPro#7302: i am not using UE tho just in general
 BadPiggy#5202: Don't update now. It'll end after the jam finishes lol
 Redline#7370: not right now lol
 GodOfPro#7302: should i install UE or wait for a new update because i don't want to keep updating UE
 wumpus#3512: you wont fail if you believe you wont! you got this!
 CodingLord#1012: I fear I might not be able to make it
 ZedDev#4726: Finally managed to make bullets bounce
 Redline#7370: 471 is a cursed number don't think about it
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 The Wandering Shadow#4975: i'm turning in, another failure under my belt. good luck, excited to play some games tomorrow
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: if you put a pound on it you'd get a pound and a penny back
 Lawn#1538: $82.53
 The Wandering Shadow#4975: sigh
 Yollie#2239: how much do yall want to bet that itch will be down tonight
 Kasper#4286: tyty ok! back to work xD
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: brrrrr
 Redline#7370: mod goes brrrr
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: yeah for the next 8 hours!
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: take it to  plz!
 Kasper#4286: ty again, acu seems to work , I can still reupload and update after right? 😮
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: yes
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: You won't be able to get the random queue/rate games until after the jam is finished I think??
 Klemp#9694: does anybody know how to convert a pygame project to html5 or a java applet?
 yassine569#9906: Or play
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: if you have submitted a game, you can play games arbitrarily. if you didn't, you have to play some from a random list first (i don't know exactly how many for this year)
 yassine569#9906: Where can we test the games
 velvetlobster#4638: do people have to play our games like in LDjam?
 Kasper#4286: okok ty ill have a look !
 cardy64#4627: I made my game based around a rolling coin for some reason and I dont know why, but a coin is just a two sided die right??
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: it has to be public, yes
 Acu1000#5560: yes, you have to make it public
yes, zip build is ok
the submit page is not meant for uploading, only submitting
the way you'd upload any other non-jam game
 Kasper#4286: Do I have to make it public? is a zip of my build folder ok ? whats wrong? how do you mean normally?
 Acu1000#5560: 8
 Ronnil706#3407: how many hours
 Acu1000#5560: upload the game normally and then you can submit it
theres instructions on the jam page
 iwonek101#1251: Good Luck then!
 Kasper#4286: hello I cant seem to submit my game? "there are no projects on your account that you can submit for this jam" ?
 CodingLord#1012: Those are the exact same things left for me to do
 Acu1000#5560:  also happy bday
 iwonek101#1251: Lesss gooo Platforms are done some UI, music and menu and i am throwing a party at my house
 USER#8646: Lol that's a good way to playtest it
 cardy64#4627: 🥳
 Acu1000#5560: I literally forgot solution to my own puzzle
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Thanks Shadow! Got an hour left till my party starts so more playtesting and reviewing it is :D
 wumpus#3512: finally power back after 2 hours
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: can't wait to rate and play all of these games that i've playtested. It's so fun :)
 USER#8646: Just copied a signal six times lol
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: I do too!
 xqrd#4298: its about cooking the game art is pixel
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I never knew I would have to take a break from playtesting
 velvetlobster#4638: what is your game about?
 USER#8646: Am I the only one who is writing terrible spaghetti code since this is a jam
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Thanks :)
 xqrd#4298: i only need music but i cant find any that would fit my game
 cardy64#4627: happy bday
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: hello!
 Phoenix Indie#9754: 4:54 AM for me
 Funny0102#6571: I'm not the only one
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: we scoped so big with a turn based RPG, we might actually get it done though. gonna lack polish for sure
 NotExplosive#0002: it's 3:53 AM here, if I sleep I risk missing the submission window, so I'm submitting now and just gonna call it good
 Phoenix Indie#9754: nice
 velvetlobster#4638: I chose to be happy
 dardasaba#9759: ( meows in same )
 Phoenix Indie#9754: I completely skipped making good art and animation because I knew I would go into artist mode and use up the entire 48 hours
 NotExplosive#0002: i think... i'm done?
 velvetlobster#4638: music is way too cool a task to just skip it to adhere to time constraints lol
 pl0s+#4955: This was def the shortest game jam ive participated in, i still have a headache from only getting about 2 hours of sleep the whole jam lol
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: might have to abbandon music again this time around, sigh...
 BadPiggy#5202: ( oinks in finished game )
 Agentlion#1893: Last push everyone you got this!
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: you don't get gems without some pressure
 velvetlobster#4638: GMTK is like the super meat boy of the jams
 velvetlobster#4638: but presentation is way to broad, seems to be just a plus to something that is expected to be perfect already
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: I just hope our game can show off all my art and animation but I’m doubtful
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: assume itch will be down for most of the last 2 hours. try not to need it
 davidnjihiahere#6326: thank you
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: 6 hours for the 'jam proper', 2 hours grace period
 pl0s+#4955: i thought presentation was being judged
 JesusSVasquez#1009: 6Hrs
 velvetlobster#4638: less than 8
 davidnjihiahere#6326: oh my goodness. I need to hurry up. How many hours?
 Klemp#9694: game jam almost over!
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: those can't _not_ effect people
 velvetlobster#4638: in LD you get points for music and art and mood .. and humor .... none of these counts here
 MrRedShark77#2280: bruh lol
 Valkyrrii#3264: no worries, most of em won't,
 NoFace#5304: ...engrish lmao
 MrRedShark77#2280: i don't sorry, my game has no audio/sound :/
but fine
 BadPiggy#5202: What's the difference ? XD
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: If  you even submit something you're already in the top third of entrants!
 velvetlobster#4638: this is thousand times harder than LD
 RedSantar#0027: i can submit my game in the gamejam as many times as i want right? (before the deadline)
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: don't think about the game for like an hour. go for a walk or something
 JuliusCube#8501: it could also be played by 1 player. If you play it as 1 player, it tests your coordination, if you play with someone else, it tests your friendship or something idk
 velvetlobster#4638: the bar is so high in this jam I have no hopes of being showcased, just being played by a couple of people would be already a major success
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: have a shower
 Rilic#8461: I feel immensely burnt out and I'm still trying to get difficulty scaling just right and need to balance... Any tips? I feel way out of depth, at least for such a short timeframe
 NoFace#5304: last year, a two player game was showcased
 JuliusCube#8501: i dont think it does, but not many people will be bringing a friend with them when theyre rating games
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: no though you will probably have trouble getting people to play it
 Merus#7019: no rule against it, but a lot of people won't be able to play your game as intended
 velvetlobster#4638: one question though .... does it need to be single player playable? we made something that requires 2 players to play
 Zayn#4390: Ok guys 8 hours are left
 velvetlobster#4638: it seems to be creativity, enjoyment and presentation
 JuliusCube#8501: it always does dont worry
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: though you'll probably have a couple extra days margin given the weather this year
 Redline#7370: so true
 MrBen#0001: well not posted yet :)
 Aiminer357#8033: anyone exporting unity to webgl? is it taking an abysmally long time?
 Mark Brown#6982: All the info is here, I'm not Siri 😛
 Artem#0069: Congrats! Send me the link
 MrBen#0001: what r the rating cathegories?
 MrBen#0001: wow ok
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: aWeSoMe
 Mark Brown#6982: One week
 Mark Brown#6982: Yes
 JuliusCube#8501: when will the server shut down to non-patrons, is it going to be like last year where it shuts down as soon as the video comes out?
 Finboror#8230: mood
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: and how much it lasts, super Markio?
 MrBen#0001: oh ok
 JuliusCube#8501: if you have 2 accounts and have made 2 different games, then yes.
should you do it? no because its cheating.
 Mark Brown#6982: after the full 50
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: windows 10 before jam: no updates
windows 10 update the second the jam starts: hey
 JuliusCube#8501: 50 probably
 BadPiggy#5202: Does the rating period start after the initial 48 or after the full 50 ?
 Redline#7370: yep
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: no but if you do try games and leave comments, other people will play your game and it will become featured. It's called karma I thing
 JuliusCube#8501: you literally dont.
 Mark Brown#6982: Because it's 48 hours + 2 for submissions
 Redline#7370: *we need the juiccy karma boe*
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: hello everyone !
 Moloch#1312: Why did he not just call it a 50 hour game jam?
 JuliusCube#8501: its not required but it helps sometimes I think
its not too important though
your submission counts either way, it just helps with getting more ratings
 MrBen#0001: Can we vote on our selfves btw?
 CodingLord#1012: I have so much to do and there is like 6 hours left :(
 Jasper#7906: Is it? I do believe the timer has two extra hours itself. So, I think you can do anything and everything during the extra hours, but once the timer is up, you can't update anymore.
 wumpus#3512: my pc is dying from all the tabs i have open rn lmao
 Mark Brown#6982: No, it's not required
 NikolajRC#5885: Do I have to vote on other people's games before my submission counts? I would love to, but I am going on holiday in a few hours, and I will  not have any internet at all.
 velvetlobster#4638: oh just found it, its only enjoyment, creativity and presentation
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: it's visuals aren't the best for now but we have let's think 6:30 hours left
i've got this
 Moloch#1312: Not so much. The extra two hours are for already submitted titles to be patched and updated. Can't submit anything new once the timer is up.
 BanananaMonke#3591: creative idea... if the visuals are good too, you can have an epic game
 velvetlobster#4638: what are the categories? I can't seem to find in the jam description
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: True, that means DO NOT SLEEP xD
 Minus#1843: we might be able to finish our game in last minute of jam, that's something :V
 MrBen#0001: yep
 RayZor#8982: i didnt watch the trailer xD i just went to itch saw theme and boom
 BanananaMonke#3591: yea...
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: A ghost buster board game/pokemon style rpg with boss fights
 velvetlobster#4638: will there be categories games will be ranked like in Ludum Dare?
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: isn't that literally the same thing?
 Zayn#4390: and yes Mark mentioned that in the jam trailer, he said that there will be no late submissions this year but we will have 2 extra hours
 BanananaMonke#3591:  what game ar you making
 Valkyrrii#3264: bets on itch crashing again?
 MrBen#0001: I think that graphicly my game looks the best 😵‍💫
 RayZor#8982: G sir
is it a puzzle were you have to end with your dice having a single number?
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Mine isn't fun... forgot that part
 Zayn#4390: ray yo
 BanananaMonke#3591: RockBird is cool
 Redline#7370: mine's simple but complex but probably fun?
 RayZor#8982: shiz
 Mark Brown#6982: More games have been submitted to this year's jam than 2017's jam. A good start!
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Welp my game is uploaded lol - its so basic tho
 Merus#7019: nope
 BanananaMonke#3591: a very very very very basic game. i saw like 10 people make the same game
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: It's also my new name
I'm RockBirdStudios/Guy
 Zayn#4390: late submissions are not allowed lol
 RayZor#8982: **are late submissions allowed? cos i dont think i can make it in time**
 MrBen#0001: OMFG IM DONE
 BanananaMonke#3591: didnt noticed your new profile picture :D
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: Cool! What game are ya making
 Beardules#6108: Weeeeeell I'm not gonna be anywhere near able to upload by deadline 🤣
 BanananaMonke#3591: yea
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629:  you're also here?
 Zayn#4390: Main Menu almost done lmfao
 Tornado#0975: lets come dms
 PickleOstrich#2216: What do you need I really should go to bed but if it’s easy maybe I’ll help
 ZedDev#4726: I need to make the in game UI, add some more enemy variations, finish the leveling system and i can do the first build
 Snage#1337: "they are a safety net for emergencies, don't rely on them" - walrusware(mod)
 BadPiggy#5202: Finished everything except for music now
 Tornado#0975: Anyone whos not making a game can they help me make some arts. My artist havent came online
 Naemless#8596: i havent properly started my game yet
 Aledrite#4274: ahh i see
 AkariZero#2463: I gathered the teams, set up the core mechanics, and made a lot of the decisions on how the game looks and plays. Still wish I knew the Godot Engine better
 icekiller158#1816: there is no submission period, the whole 50 hours is the jam
 Redline#7370: I'm finding so many oversights/bugs right now
 Snage#1337: 7* the other 2 r for sumbitting
 AkariZero#2463: thanks. I ended up becoming more of a game director though for my first game jam
 Aledrite#4274: 9 hours left o.o
 R2D2Vader#0693: My game hates chrome for some reason. It also goes blank whenever you tab out of your browser or go to a different browser tab 😭  gamemaker moment
 Snage#1337: *frantic clicking to make sure i have*
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: I have to upload my game now though, because my family are coming round soon so I won't be able to upload it later
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: True
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: hey at least you're realising this now and not in five hours
 davidnjihiahere#6326: yikes. Sorry to hear that
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: I should've probably installed WebGL before the Jam, now building my game is taking ages...
 AkariZero#2463: I cut myself on the first day of the jam XD my left index finger is angry wiht me
 Zayn#4390: No problem 😄!
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Ooh nice oki (sorry ive never done a jam before)
 Zayn#4390: yes...
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: I can't wait to play everyone elses games - are you allowed to do that before the deadline?
 Acu1000#5560: itch can't crash for you if you never open it 🧠
 BanananaMonke#3591: what
 Redline#7370: guys, itch can't crash if you have it already open 😎
 davidnjihiahere#6326: no no no. I didn't say that
I meant to say that itch will probably crash
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: wdym?
 Yollie#2239: oh god what will happen on the deadline 💀
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: wait is itch actually crashing? 7 hours before the deadline?
that has to be a record
 Moloch#1312: Are you using a butler wrapper?
 davidnjihiahere#6326: itch crashing and rendered useless that's the pain
 Lemon#7606: deadline panic, my sole motivator
 KadDev#8100: I feel like I am working much more efficiently now, why couldn't I have worked like this yesterday
 Redline#7370: me: goes to the toilet
also me: finds a possible bug in the game
 davidnjihiahere#6326: I'm nearly done with the mechanics
 BanananaMonke#3591: i have seen like 10 other people making the exact same game as me, but with better visuals
 Sappir#7051: No worries, my player still a capsule.
 BanananaMonke#3591: it is already epic that you finished your game
 R2D2Vader#0693: My concept is also kinda terrible lmao 😭  but hey it's my first game jam and i finished early
 BanananaMonke#3591: yep my visuals are trash too
 R2D2Vader#0693: F
 NikolajRC#5885: Is not, then I guess the first one failed to go through
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: if you've done it twice there will be two on your profile on itch
 R2D2Vader#0693: everyone's game looks super impressive, mine is visually terrible
 wumpus#3512: Power cut... In the last 5 hours or so
 NikolajRC#5885: I had a few problems submitting, I think I tried a few times before it worked, can I check if I have submitted the same project twice?
 steve#7574: think im done with my game tbh
 wumpus#3512: Power cut... In the last 5 hours or so
 Moloch#1312: Nope, you've got two hours after that timer is up I believe.
 LOPSTERu#3902: actually i will probably do that
 NoelJasik#8768: Does the currently displaying time on Itch.io also includes the 2 hour upload period?
 Martin111#0333: use the revered rectangle
 LOPSTERu#3902: what if i just don't make art for the player because i don't know what to make...
 Lukey#6052: Lmao I wasted like an entire hour+ and then jumped on call with my friend and just pumped out a major feature and now I'm making like 3 more major features with only 7 hours remaining (less than 7 tho cuz sleep).
 Zayn#4390: Lmao
 Russian posh cat support ukraine#6575: we are not even colse to finishing
 steve#7574: should i make a menu or nah because im not feeling like making one tbh lol
 anth#0817: loooooove making menus when i dont feel like doing the hard parts thatll actually make the game playable lmao
 Zayn#4390: hype hype !
 Russian posh cat support ukraine#6575: 9 hours left.....
 Uthel#6594: other than that, smooth sailing, no real snags
 Uthel#6594: I overwrote my gamemanager by accident with one from another project (while importing a custom package) - took 1:45 to rewrite it
 steve#7574: rip
 Martin111#0333: god
 adrenalyzed#5024: make sure to unpack your prefabs before deleting them !
 pixal#1121: Well done
 Martin111#0333: WTF
 Zutilt10 | Jonathan. W#0339: Looking at the time, yeah this isn't gonna work out. Over-scoped. Oh well there's always next year
 Zayn#4390: yeah same, yesterday I got 60% of the game done so yeh
 adrenalyzed#5024: accidentally deleted my player with no hope of undoing ._.
 steve#7574: because i've just done that but the game looks bad lol
 SeanSS#0892: Godspeed o7
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: normaly I should be working in the game mechanics. But I want to work in the music a little
 steve#7574: is it really a good idea to make a game without using a game engine for a gamejam?
 Redline#7370: hah I don't
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: i feel so more relaxed than yesterday
 Moloch#1312: Alas because I'm a pain in my own ass I already have the .blend for three different sets I'm just not looking forward to having to Boolean 3 different sets of 6 different die shapes to get the numbers on in their respective fonts
That's like 156 booleans
 ^_^#9116: Hello
 xqrd#4298: i only need 1 sfx, music and im done
 subwave [Rolling Dice]#0193: Finally finished!
This dice model is amazing
 ZedDev#4726: Okay f it, i don't have time, i'll just add an exp based leveling system
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Dude I found a really good dice model if you want me to send it to you?
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: I've made my game - its a super simple one and tbh the movement feels kinda bad, but its done now 🙂
 Moloch#1312: Y'all out here making menus and I only just realised I didn't make any dice models yet
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: ~~this will happen in some seconds~~
if you wanna see bugs play hollow knight
 AZOTh the Creator#7094: now i need to make tutorial and prepare pesticide for some bugs...
 Magma#4391: Ah, alright
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: no after deadline you can't edit your project
so don't touch anything
uploads are stopped,  if you delete a file from itch.io your project is dead
 LOPSTERu#3902: Dang you guys have a tutorial?
 Zayn#4390: Ok tutorial level finished now I need to make a main menu
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: well, do more if you can, but first finish the basic game and then build as many levels as you want
 Magma#4391: can you add builds for different platforms after the deadline?
 Shimp#0064: ill do two then, do menu, and then make third one, if lucky, fourth will be done
 ZedDev#4726: Oof
 steve#7574: i completely forgot about that fuck
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: don't worry bugs are seen in the showtime
I ~~once~~before 6-7 days programmed a sumo lego robot to not fall of the table
when showtime, it just rushed and fell off
 Zayn#4390: lol same
 Shimp#0064: its small ish
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: it depends
small levels? no
big levels? hm... 2 more would not be bad
huge levels? why you made a second?
 ZedDev#4726: For the first time ever, i didn't see a single bug that i previously left
 Acu1000#5560: Aight my game's core parts are done, now just levels, audio and the 🇵🇱
 adrenalyzed#5024: time to make a main menu
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: what to do?
do stuff
fix bugs
play the game
Polish
*polish*
POLISH
 Shimp#0064: guys, is two levels enough for jam?
 ZedDev#4726: My first jam was actually Ludum Dare 50 but i didn't have enough time to finish because of exams and school
 wumpus#3512: POLISH POLISH POLISH my boy
 Acu1000#5560: polish it and add features
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: if your parents let you
 dardasaba#9759: Aaand, my game is pretty much done!
~~now what do I do in the remaining 7 hours~~
 Uthel#6594: this was my first game jam 😛 been making games for a while now though
 ZedDev#4726: Started drinking it at 14 lmao
 wumpus#3512: you can drink coffee as a minor lmao (though i guess it depends on like parents and whatnot)
 steve#7574: same LOL
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: well I also will because I can it is 12:45 here (morning) so I'm okay with sleep
 Acu1000#5560: I didn't drink a single drop of coffee or energetics, I just listen to metal gear rising OSTs on a loop. Even more powerful
 ZedDev#4726: Still haven't drank my coffee
 KadDev#8100: same, I promised myself that I would upload this time
 Uthel#6594: well, its been what, 40 hours ish
 AZOTh the Creator#7094: me neither...i think i should work till the last minute of game jam
 PixTrick#5808: i'm far from finishing xD
 wumpus#3512: with the way your typing, and saying you drank twelve litres of coffee, i doubt it lmao
 Acu1000#5560: The experienced ones did
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: not me hehe
 Uthel#6594: I sleep soon possibly
 KadDev#8100: so many people have finished...
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: yay solo dev power!
 Uthel#6594: twelve litres of coffee, and every single hour since the jam started
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: idk about you,  and  makes me happy seeing I'm not the only one unfinished
 Uthel#6594: Phew, I went hard, just submitted, solo dev powerrrrr
 ertu#9255: ok
 williamdoro#8857: just say u made it urself if no audio
 SLiV#5820: Man, showers are amazing. I woke up feeling groggy and unsure, but now not only do I feel refreshed, I've also made a breakthrough. (Instead of having a party of adventurers which would take too much time, I'm giving the hero a sword, a bow, a spell book and a musical instrument.)
 ertu#9255: hm, silence is pre-existing sound...
 williamdoro#8857: ok
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: nope sorry its set fo the channel
 williamdoro#8857: ok but can u reset my slowmode im asleep when it runs out
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yeah I understand I just want people not to be confused, you're not in trouble
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: 
 keb#6637: both
 wumpus#3512: yeah i wasn't trying to give false information, i genuinely thought the jam was just 50 hours
 MangoWorks#1202: we have a sound designer on are team and he made the music and sounds
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: so if someone SAYS that he develops after those hours, he get's banned?
 ertu#9255: what if the game does not contains sounds, answer yes (created sounds yourself) or no (using pre-existing)? 😂
 MangoWorks#1202: oh no are teams artist is offline
 wumpus#3512: oh oops, as i said though - i will probably be finished in that time
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Yes there IS a rule against it, stop giving people false information. The last 2 hours are a safety net for emergencies. The game jam is 48 hours long that is how long you have to make your game
 Zayn#4390: Alright I just finished my Tutorial Level now all that's left to do is level designing, a bit polishing and Playtesting! also I still need to make a main menu T_T
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: hey chat
 Zayn#4390: gosh
 JesusSVasquez#1009: I've just finish the core of the game now, the problem is that all assets are white. They have no materials x_x
 Taccos#1054: im so close to finishing my game
 wumpus#3512: im going to be finished before those 2 hours lmao, doesnt affect me
 keb#6637: cheater....
 ertu#9255: I'm waiting 9 hours
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: hey
I'm the 2
 keb#6637: by submitting i mean that they are not for developing the game
 nicompany#4718: nice ava, bro!
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: pov: because you said that, you die in the exact deadline moment
 Zayn#4390: nice!
 wumpus#3512: they aren't just for submitting, you could submit in the last 30 seconds, it just gives time to those using older engines or with worse computers
 NiallCrabtree#2618: awesome glad to hear!
 ertu#9255: and I finally made game
 Zayn#4390: Getting closer and closer to the deadline 😮
 MangoWorks#1202: nice
 keb#6637: godot exports are really fast too, about 10 seconds for me (at least for html5)
 MangoWorks#1202: i usually spend the last 30m submitting because construct 3 exports a web build with no errors in 20s
 SleepyJeff#9492: Right! That's what I tell myself each time when I do something else 🤣
 keb#6637: oh man 7 hours left right? since the last 2 hours are for submitting
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: My game also but it's no good if I don't polish it
 MangoWorks#1202: hey you know whats funny my game is almost done but its not even playable till its done
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: oh this sounds cool
 Jasper#7906: or put another way: you just regained energy by watching youtube for 20 minutes and now you can get back to the game and make something great
 wumpus#3512: 8 hours is still plenty of time, dont worry
 ertu#9255: i know
 keb#6637:  a videogame that i made
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: oh no geez I lost 20 minutes in youtube
 MrBen#0001: just wanted to hear opinion about the look of the page
 MrBen#0001: its not published yet
 Redline#7370: nah I'm not doing that title
 Jasper#7906: 
 Soup#3034: thief! you stole DICE GAME: THE GAME's name
 Redline#7370: ah yes "dice game" for the name of my game
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Please read the rules before asking about them
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: you can edit the page you can't edit the files until voting is finished
 adrenalyzed#5024: my game is finally at a playable state! lets go
 theChief#0001: Yep!
 theChief#0001: Make sure you have all your most fun content at the start I guess 😉
 Redline#7370: yeah I'm making the main menu rn
 Jolomoju#6021: Can we edit the game page after the gamejam is ended?
 Sappir#7051: oh uh, what if i aimed for a 30 minute action game
 theChief#0001: I'd prioritise like this:
- Main menu
- hit markers
- settings
- more enemies
- tutorial
- boss fights
 nekotheasparagus#0809: My game is so boring and only barely fits the theme rn without the planned stuff that I set aside to make sure it actually works
 GameDude#3494: Oh yeah, people's attention spans are VERY short when they have thousands of games to play
 theChief#0001: Hundreds of years of gameplay, probably xD
 Redline#7370: but I should do more enemies + boss fights + hitmarkers + main menu + settings + tutorial
 Lukey#6052: Imagine how great it'd be if 48 hours of work = 48 hours of gameplay. Then AAA games would be like years worth of gameplay
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: upload your game then you can experiment without issues
 theChief#0001: 15 mins is probably a little long 😅 most people will stop playing after 2-3 mins, I find that about 5 mins is a good length to aim for
 ichthyotoxicity#3925: Good plan. I think I'll roll the dice (ba dum tschh) and take a nap. Maybe I'll wake up in an hour, maybe I'll wake up in 12 hours.
 adrenalyzed#5024: depends what your game is
 Redline#7370: hmm now the question is, should I add abilities or would that make my game so complicated that it just becomes bad
 GameDude#3494: 48 hours of work for 15 minutes of simple gameplay (in my game at least). Really shows how hard game dev actually is.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: upload what you have then go for a rest and take it from there
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: get a 1 hour nap
 ichthyotoxicity#3925: I'd get diminishing returns, as I'm already almost too tired to focus. I appreciate the encouragement though. 😄
 wren#0640: man i keep getting comments telling me to add hold down to move movement and like i WOULD but that bc of how my movement script works id have to completely rewrite it which would break so many things and im not doing that at this point in the jam lol
 Lukey#6052: Hello people of the world! DM me if you wanna playtest my game, I wanna know what it's missing. Thanks :D
 Hederlunden#3231: ah yes, the hit game amogus
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: spend 8 more hours
 vell#4314: hey guys
i need a good tool to make sound effects
and I don't have time for a tool that takes long to learn
 GameDude#3494: My eyes are completely sore, and my head aching all over the place. Just one more bug, one more...
 Redline#7370: hmm venting? you mean the thing you do in that game released in 2018 by InnerSloth?
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: sorry I just wanted to inform the general guys
the people that don't even open 
 ichthyotoxicity#3925: On the one hand, I could spend 8 more hours adding sound, music, and general improvements. Or, I could get to sleep before 3am...
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: chill on the caps. there's a  channel for hype and venting.
 Hederlunden#3231: 8 HOURS?!?!?! HOW THE HELL am I gonn finish this!??!?!? I got so much more to code and so many bugs
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: STRESS**SS**
 xqrd#4298: OH NO
 Redline#7370: NOT THE STRESS
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: friendly reminder:
we have 8 more hours
STRESSSS
 Talal#7877: oops sorry
 Redline#7370: 
 ichthyotoxicity#3925: I did finish some version of my game, but it's the most basic possible version. Could use more polish, but I'm done for today.
 Ahnaf30e#3408: i need to add an end screen, death screen, sound fx
 xqrd#4298: i only need to do the main menu, tutorial, end screen and im done
 WorkingJoe#4433: But I'm working on (by my standards) some A-tier procedural generation though
 Jasper#7906: I believe in all of you finishing some version of your games!
 adrenalyzed#5024: i just had a break and im ready to grind
 WorkingJoe#4433: In terms of gameplay so far you can: drag your mouse and particles move around \:DD
 KadDev#8100: Alright, thanks
 Hederlunden#3231: idk if i will finish my game tbh
 WorkingJoe#4433: I have no clue how far I will get towards finishing anything, schedule is completely out of the window. I'm still working on dynamic meshes for cloth sims lol
 MangoWorks#1202: i got a nice 6 hours of sleep now its grind time
 Soup#3034: i want to upload the game before i go to bed, ill sleep better knowing all the essential stuff is done
 ichthyotoxicity#3925: Better to do that and get feedback on how to do better next time. People are often quite supportive of the effort, even if you didn't finish what you had in mind.
 KadDev#8100: Oh ok, I hope it doesn't get to that point though
 Ragh#5984: I just got to the point where I need to code the game logic, aparently asset making and option selection takes too much time
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: of course
 Lukey#6052: Oh, yeah lol!
 KadDev#8100: Am I allowed to post an unfinished game?
 WorkingJoe#4433: By some arcane power I do feel well rested
 GuyWithTime#7852: Yo ur profile picture reminds me of mine
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Once you get your core game stuff get it up on itch and link t to the jam. Then see what time you have for the extra polish etc. That way if something happens you have a version posted up.
Cheat sheet about launching a game on itch but also super importantly the last step of adding the game to the game jam
 Phoenix Indie#9754: 3AM grind let’s goooo
 Lukey#6052: Okay I've added a windows build alongside my web build just in case (cuz web build is laggy sadly)
 GuyWithTime#7852: I just woke up so I think that's enough of a break
 butternoodles#4171: Ayyy congratz everyone who made progress
 tykenn#8548: Finally my game has a beginning, middle, and end. Feels good to move on to the more optional stuff.
 alexandremoreira#9652: hey all! just a reminder to take breaks everyone! I just finished building a fully functional prototype, and I had to take a lot of breaks to make everything work, so just remember to stay hydrated and not drive yourself nuts over this. just have fun! 🙂
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yeah its fine lots of people will have similar ideas etc
 USER#8646: oh ok, its not gonna be the most fun and innovative game  but i hope its fine for a first game
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yeah absolutely
 Zayn#4390: OK guys
 Andruoff#9640: i'd imagine so, rules are pretty loose
 USER#8646: am i allowed to make something simmilar to yatzee though?
 spagoogi#5559: mechanics are (hopefully) going to be done in maybe an hour or so and then it is level-making time and other assorted tidbits
 USER#8646: but i want some kind of output randomness so that its not 100% predicatble
 ZedDev#4726: I only have 1 thing left to do so pretty good
 USER#8646: thank you for letting me know about that i can make something simmilar
 NiallCrabtree#2618: hows everyone feeling about the scope of their project this morning. We are a bit behind but implementing the core gameplay early afternoon today
 ZedDev#4726: WebGl doesn't work properly in my windows partition, prob the graphics driver
 89o#5368: Wondering if the name "Die, die" is taken yet or if I should come up with a better one
 Omegnight#7081: Everyone should upload a build now to see if there's no error playing the game elsewhere than within the engine
 ZedDev#4726: Its a top down shooter where you trow dices at stuff and they deal damage randomly
 Zayn#4390: Okay so I got a good looking dice now
 Peterino#3257: five bucks says its about dice
 steeleater#7580: what's it about?
 ZedDev#4726: I really need a name for my game, at most 2 words cause i will finish it in a bit and i want to send it as fast as i can
 Andruoff#9640: hmmmmm, mega Yahtzee with powerups?
 USER#8646: ok but i still want to do add something that resembles gmeplay like using your diec to get rewards etc
 Lukey#6052: This sounds like it belongs in a chocolate bar ad lmao
 Peterino#3257: i mean if you got time to recover for a day or so after a hard crunch its never that bad. but not a good idea to make it into a habit (people can sometimes abuse it)
 Soup#3034: im doing the last thing before level design
 Andruoff#9640: make it      s a t i s f y i n g (don't ask me how lol)
 NoFace#5304: I know it feels like that sometimes but I need to kill off some energy somehow
 USER#8646: hey so i had an idea for a game that turned out to be a little outside my scope, basically I only have a game that rolls 20 dice that you can move in a calculator and it calculates it.Is there any way to turn this into something fun within 10 hours (its my first game so i cant make something crazy)
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: it says it on the itch page I'm pretty sure
 Peterino#3257: (though i did find out the jam was happening like... noon today lmao)
 Fusoy#6101: The only acceptable crunch is the chocolate bar
 Kritical#4329: Should probably pin that or smth
 Peterino#3257: not worth it imo ive spent a grand total of 7 hours on my game and fuck im lovin it
 Arleycht#7791: 👍
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: once you've linked the game to the jam its linked and done, you can still update the files though
 Lukey#6052: ahhhhh my web build is sooo laggy. probably gonna upload a windows build just to be safe
 Phoenix Indie#9754: I think that game jams are an incredible opportunity to improve your overall game dev skill, but they are definitely too intense of an environment to start learning
That’s why this one’s my first one, I already have some experience from a project that I’ve been working on in my own free time at my own pace
 Arihan10#7379: funny how 90% of the game is always completed in the final stretch, lol
 Kritical#4329: The progress channel is off limits for me, i wont finish if i compare my game those ones
 Arleycht#7791: Does submitting to the jam replace old submissions? I need to replace my old submission
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: don't
 NoFace#5304: I will crunch so hard
 steeleater#7580: going into the progress screenshots and seeing people start to flesh out and polish their game after trying to make the dice behave in literally any way i wanted it to was an experience more humbling than any other
 caibi#5324: my mom said the jam end on 3:00 pm, so she take away it
 Redline#7370: what did you doooo?????
 Andruoff#9640: oooooooof
 Arihan10#7379: Can we still make changes to our game (i.e upload new files) if the project has been "submitted" to the jam? (Given the deadline is not yet past)
 Aledrite#4274: oof
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: thats ok, use what you learned about how much yo got done vs what you had planned etc. You'll also have figured out how to do a bunch of stuff that won't take you so long next time
 steeleater#7580: i suppose the next one is a mere 365 arduous days away though
 steeleater#7580: i just don't think i have the experience
 Phoenix Indie#9754: Oooof
For me programming is the toughest part as well, mostly because I can’t translate my thoughts into actual code
That’s why I program using a visual scripting tool, but what works for me might not work for you
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Yes you can, submitting just links it to the jam and you only have to do it once
 steeleater#7580: from my calculations it has taken me about 8-10 minutes to write every finished line of code in this project
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: sounds good
 Redline#7370: if I click on the "submit your project" button, I can still change the files of the project untill I have time right?
 birdstone#3073: it's 2 am i was just about to sleep lol
goodnight folks
 Kritical#4329: Dont finish or collapse cause i might have to do one of those
 MikeHazeJr#6582: Just made my first submission (ever). It is a bit buggy, but I don't have any more energy to work on it right now, and might not be able to get to it before the deadline, so it's posted.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: take a rest lol
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: absolutely get your game up and linked to the jam as early as possible
 birdstone#3073: godly advice
 Redline#7370: pro tip: don't
 Kritical#4329: Same thing with me but just for one game so you already are better off than me
 birdstone#3073: i just finished and god i feel like i'm going to collapse
 steeleater#7580: i have gone through 4 different games with varied levels of actual progress and none of them got to an even half playable state
 LOPSTERu#3902: Is it a good idea to make the itch page for the game now?
 NikolajRC#5885: Thanks. We'll see about that whole "working" thing though 🙂
 steeleater#7580: making even a mildly functional product seems to fall under the programming side
 Phoenix Indie#9754: What part of it is difficult to you? Game design, programming, art, music?
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: as long as it works on windows with no external dependencies (and won't crash mark's computer)
 sendhelpidfk#6700: ok so apparently completely redoing it from scratch fixed it
which would have been nice to know several hours ago
 GameDude#3494: AHHHH, STILL NOT DONE
 macleodian#7269: It feels good doing menus, always feels like a ton of progress is made in a short amount of time
 NikolajRC#5885: Hey, I got a question,  is it legal to submit something made from scratch in C/C++ using my own graphical engine?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: progress pics to show off, art help for feedback
 steeleater#7580: this development shit is too hard. im throwing in the towel
 davidnjihiahere#6326: thanks for the pointers
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: probably art help if you want feedback
 MrGeko#4743: 'Other engine' feels right, I guess it doesn't matter regardless XD
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: art help and progress pics are enabled for images
 Soup#3034: you have to put it in 
 Michel#2879: 
 davidnjihiahere#6326: mind I ask, how does this look?
wait, I might have to post it in another channel
 MrGeko#4743: Ye
 Soup#3034: haha
 Giga chad#0085: wrong person I mean 
 Andruoff#9640: this is my first time ever "properly" making a game and it's jank and not that great but I'm proud of what I've learned and excited to do more in the future
 Soup#3034: ?
 Giga chad#0085: u used there libraries right
 Andruoff#9640: ooooooooof, thats rough
 Soup#3034: because i had to cut the main mechanic that gave my game its name, im now renaming my game to "DICE GAME: THE GAME"
 MrGeko#4743: I'm submitting my game now, I made it with the LOVE2D framework. Should I say it was made with 'other engine' or 'no engine'? 'Cuz love2d isn't really a game engine
 Andruoff#9640: 🤝
 BadPiggy#5202: Oink
 Giga chad#0085: who sais 9 hours is not enough for ***1*** feature?
 anth#0817: 🤝
 anth#0817: can always add it in in a post jam version!!
 Andruoff#9640: finish it later!
 Giga chad#0085: next year
 CodingLord#1012: I feel so bad to remove a cool feature from my game due to lack of time.
 ◈・ Altaꐟ#9999: when will the next jam be ?
 Snakey-Studios#6342: ok thx
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yeah you did, you didn't use premade 3rd party assets
 Snakey-Studios#6342: so i say that i made it
 Shadow the Dragon#6927: Just finished my Jam game and woo I feel good. *Now to go to slep cause it's 3:30 in the morning.*
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yep
 Snakey-Studios#6342: hey guys, on the subbmittions it says to choose if you made the vast majority of the art, my game is made of mostly default square assets, so do i say i made it or not?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: 1 week
 Giga chad#0085: How long will be voting time
 sendhelpidfk#6700: so tomorrow i have like 3-6 hours tops
 qxt2019#6669: uff
 sendhelpidfk#6700: i'm in pst and i still need actual content for my game
 Giga chad#0085: is anyone done and has time to playtest my game with me?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: they are a safety net for emergencies, don't rely on them
 Snage#1337: oh yea last 2 r for submitting only
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: 9 hours not 11
 Snage#1337: 11hrs
 qxt2019#6669: i mean u still have a whole day left
 sendhelpidfk#6700: despite all inheriting from the exact same parent, one of my structure entities refuses to function properly
 qxt2019#6669: whats the problem ?
 sendhelpidfk#6700: gah i was making actual progress for so long and then the main thing the game needs to function gave up entirely
 qxt2019#6669: what colors are up, left, right  and stop?
 qxt2019#6669: i have a question
 Tornado#0975: OH RIGHT AHHH I SHOULDNT HAVE RASTERIZED IT
 WolfHound#8804: So uhh.... how's everyone commenting been
 MrBen#0001: my game is finished now it's sound time.
 MrBen#0001: yep
 Sappir#7051: oh np, honestly that makes sense
 NoFace#5304: Hey BP!
 Soup#3034: i tried to answer this in a good way, but the truth is, i dont have good ideas for enemies so i dont base either after the other, i just want to do level design last bc its easier
 caibi#5324: unity shader cursed, yeah, let’s make a purple game
 nekotheasparagus#0809: Assume you won’t have the last couple hours, but be glad if you do
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yeah don't plan to upload it at the last second, give yourself time to test it works
 snares#8483: thanks! will use for reference when i inevitably publish last second
 Sappir#7051: creating level based on enemies vs creating enemies based on level designed? Maybe its a matter of preference? How is it for you?
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: the only right you sign off by entering the jam is the right for mark to include the game in his video. other than that it completely belongs to you, do whatever
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: If anyone is struggling to put their game on itch
Cheat sheet about launching a game on itch but also super importantly the last step of adding the game to the game jam
 Soup#3034: yeah
 sendhelpidfk#6700: debugging speedrun any% so that i can actually make content
 skejeton#5788: oh wait nevermind had to set the game to HTML instead of Executable
 skejeton#5788: nope, there's just no way to tell it to use the browser embed, no checkbox like there used to be
 Pixstatic#3464: it's your game, do what you want!
 Phoenix Indie#9754: Nice! I liked the idea I came up with, and I don’t want it going to waste
 Sappir#7051: You make enemies before level design?
 Giga chad#0085: is it Unity?
 Lunar#4998: nice nice
 williamdoro#8857: yeak absolutely
 skejeton#5788: uhh why does itch not allow me to publish a browser game
 Giga chad#0085: Guys I finnaly got Unity working with Webgl
 Soup#3034: i like it because ive already done the hard part by then
 Lunar#4998: okayy i was just curious
 Redline#7370: is there a rule against it? no
 Sappir#7051: Level design scares me.
 Lukey#6052: yes
 Lunar#4998: soo quick question, are we allowed to make a sequel of these games? like after the game jam ends
 williamdoro#8857: tis python, but ill see if its possible
 WorkingJoe#4433: Good morning again people
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: thats sort of the point, those more or less come out even
 Soup#3034: level design is the best part
 caibi#5324: oh wait, I a blind, I can still do it, lmao
 Redline#7370: there's still 9 hours to go bruh
 Pixstatic#3464: can you do a webgl build?
 Pixstatic#3464: :(
 GarroGa#5418: is not even close to being playable
 Pixstatic#3464: you have 11 hours still
 GarroGa#5418: I'm not going to make it
 Redline#7370: maybe, but which one is better? some bad music you put together in an hour, wasting precious time on it instead of polishing your game further, or using a good sounding music from online, and you get more time polishing your game, which might result in higher gameplay scores?
 gnarbro#1627: That works too! I just wanted to put more effort into the mechanics/gameplay than the music.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: If you are putting music/sounds in your game please add a mute button on a volume slider, it helps a lot of people out and often allows them to play your game for longer
 Lukey#6052: I'm currently waiting for unity to make a test build so I can see what I'm working with and make sure my itch.io page is working (perhaps I can convince someone to playtest) and then I'll make some tweaks and adjustments and then sleep :D
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: awesome
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: sometimes its better to have no music than music that it really out of place
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: actually people usually give higher ratings on music made within the jam, same with art
 Phoenix Indie#9754: nice
 gnarbro#1627: Mine doesn't have any music, so you're doing better than me 🤷‍♂️
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Oh I thought that maybe if you put in the description that you made it yourself then people would know that you put more effort into it and give you a higher rating
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: im gonna be going to bed now, im tired, good night
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: thx
 Redline#7370: *people don't care about who made it, people care about how it sounds*
 Sappir#7051: How does this work?
 Soup#3034: congrats
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: The fact that you made it yourself will also get you better ratings probably
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: i submitted my project 🙂 (finally)
 Redline#7370: I don't really have time to make music so I just go there and pick something that fits the game
 Phoenix Indie#9754: Well frick
I hope that the crappy music I made can cut it 😐
 Soup#3034: almost done
 BadPiggy#5202: Ah aight
I'ma see then. If I really can't make some decent dubstep or something then I'ma use it
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Well it's my first time participating so
 Redline#7370: there's a "copy and paste" thing in the description of the videos paste that
 BadPiggy#5202: So in my itch page I just have to say " music taken from " and then link the vid or something ?
 Redline#7370: those are all royalty free my man, just need to give credit
 hatoving#4710: good luck!
 BadPiggy#5202: Wait really ?
We can ?
 nekotheasparagus#0809: My goal is to make a better game than I did last year
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: I'm not even gonna bother with that
My goal is to be in the top 90% lmao
 Sappir#7051: Ah my unity crashed xD
 hatoving#4710: thanks guys! now I know what it's like to rush through the evening to make 10 levels playable lmfao
 Lemon#7606: I hope to be able to say the same thing in the next 11 hours
 BadPiggy#5202: Aight. I'm done with everything for the game
Now comes the hardest part
***Audio and music*** :eyes:
 Redline#7370: noice
 Sappir#7051: Grats!
 Amelia-chan#4996: Woo!!!
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Nice!
 hatoving#4710: just released my first ever game (and game jam game) lol
 Redline#7370: at least make it all CAPS like the rest of the text
 Tornado#0975: 
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Does anyone know what 7d impressions and CTR are ?
 Jemmeh#7117: Don't forget to give yourself time to fix build errors folks
Heading to sleep good luck everyone! 🙂
 Lemon#7606: Then there you go lol. Bosses are definitely the better route if you aren't in a time pinch
 Tornado#0975: thats smart
 birdstone#3073: i mean i've already made a boss sooo
 iwonek101#1251: let's get this boys
 LOPSTERu#3902: Alright all the level are done, now i just need to make all the art...
 Lemon#7606: Having the difficulty scale quickly and infinitely would be a good way to avoid having to code a boss and should keep it from getting boring
 iwonek101#1251: hi!
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: good morning everyone
 birdstone#3073: oh that's actually smart, ty for the input
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: also just psychologically it's going to turn out way better for you if people finish the game thinking 'that was a neat boss' and not 'i guess the game just goes on forever? this is getting boring i'm going to stop now'
 Sub  Zero#0830: Ik but keeping the same team would be hard af let's see
 Pixstatic#3464: my game looks fantastic but I still gotta make a ton of shit
 Lemon#7606: I am making sure mine doesn't lol
 birdstone#3073: 👍
 Sub  Zero#0830: Roll a dice to take over bodies and play in behalf on them-- it just dropped to one lol
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: i'd go with the latter if you think you can handle it. people usually play a jam game for like 5 minutes you don't need infinite replayability
 DaforLynx#0296: Gee, I wonder what proportion of titles will have the word "dice/die" in them
 adrenalyzed#5024: the dice was prob added in post
 birdstone#3073: for example would it be better to have infinite waves or have set waves that build up towards a boss? the latter would have a shorter experience but it would be more interesting
 Tornado#0975: the letters are probably font not the dice tho
 Lemon#7606: hey you can always expand your game outside of the jam
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: i'm not sure that's even a font
 birdstone#3073: does game play time matter?
 Tornado#0975: same
 Redline#7370: It's probably not a free font
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: what's the cool idea?
 ◈・ Altaꐟ#9999: i posted progress picture. i think it about in 1 minutes because im afraid
 SLiV#5820: I'm afraid I'll be giving every game that does this incorrectly an automatic F 😈
 Sappir#7051: When I chop my ideas, they're almost always platformers ._.
 Lemon#7606: I tried to be organized but devolved into spaghetti a couple hours in
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: mines a platformer cross with a board game lol
 Sub  Zero#0830: I had *the* coolest idea buut I had to chop it down lol
 Lukey#6052: lmao nah I ate my own code
 Phoenix Indie#9754: I love me a good platformer, what can I say
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: you ate my code?
 NoFace#5304: ...I started with a platformer too lmaooooooo
 Lukey#6052: Phew, I had spaghetti, did the dishes, and now I'm going to spend the next however many hours polishing and adding other random features
 Phallo#3476: fun fact... that is so there is always the same amount of dots carved out and always giving it a somewhat similar center of gravity as to not increase the odds to get one or another number
 NoFace#5304: ...roll = rotate, dice = die. You can use synonyms, alternate spellings and the such to think of more ideas
 Sub  Zero#0830: My idea was a platformer too lol
 Phoenix Indie#9754: noice
 vicksonzero (Him | Web/Unity)#2295: taking dice and roll even more literal
 Sub  Zero#0830: My dude me too :))
 adrenalyzed#5024: good luck on that
 vicksonzero (Him | Web/Unity)#2295: you know what, i m stopping my failed dice game and try another one
 Lemon#7606: I mean the odds are the same regardless, that's just how they make them
 Phoenix Indie#9754: My game is a 2d platformer that has the active layer of the level change at each measure of the music, with that layer being dependent on the roll of the dice
I have to painfully make six layers for each of the six levels and I’m regretting my idea
 Sub  Zero#0830: Oof
 SleepyJeff#9492: 11h40min
 adrenalyzed#5024: well now i gotta redo my uvs ._.
 Fraserfatt#1021: I’m too old to have this realization. Oh my lmao
 Phallo#3476: roughly 10
 Sub  Zero#0830: How many hours left?
 NoFace#5304: Havin a dice irl is a really great reference
 adrenalyzed#5024: ohhh crap
 Yaw#9721: this helps
 Lemon#7606: Opposite sides always equal 7 (6 is opposite 1, etc) Other than that I'm not sure if placement matters or not
 nekotheasparagus#0809: Would an unfolded 6 sided die help? Easy to find online
 adrenalyzed#5024: search up a dice roller online
 NoFace#5304: I have a dice on me
 Yaw#9721: is there a guide that tells explains if you move a dice in a given direction what side it will face? i don't have any dice on me at the moment.
 nekotheasparagus#0809: Honestly I’m kinda digging the look of my placeholder cubes… might keep them at least for the “board”
 NoFace#5304: ...Noice
 adrenalyzed#5024: my game is in "you have a game but you still needa add 30 things until its playable"
 Ragh#5984: mine is still on the "it looks like a game" phase
 LOPSTERu#3902: my game is a platformer where a dice decides what mechanic you have lol
 Fraserfatt#1021: throwing and recalling dice was real fun to make. I just ran out of time for good *content*
 NoFace#5304: Yay! my game's still in "brain-cells-processing" phase
 CrazyTurtle2000#3954: My game is less of a game and more of just a digital dice roller lol.. i had a much cooler idea in mind at the start but the scope was way too big.. 😦
 Fraserfatt#1021: my game is room-by-room eliminating enemies by whipping floating dice at them. Every hit plays a random particle effect. Didn’t have enough time to make actual gameplay effects 😂
 adrenalyzed#5024: yoo
 Lemon#7606: I'm almost to that point
 nekotheasparagus#0809: My game finally has reached “well it’s technically a game” so yay
 NoFace#5304: Cool, my dice roll is more voluntary however
 Fusoy#6101: I hope someone made a game where the dice is playing rock'n'roll
 adrenalyzed#5024: mine is a dice that rolls every 10 seconds and you get a different ability every time you roll
 NoFace#5304: huh
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: already seen one like this
 Sappir#7051: Hmm nice thanks
 Jolomoju#6021: 2 submission??? I can barely make 1 x_x
 adrenalyzed#5024: mine is very similar to that
 NoFace#5304: Since like 25% of people have posted their games or are asleep, I will share my idea. I'm making a topdown rougelike shooter and you have a roll move and every time you roll, your gun type changes
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: yes, there's nothing to stop you
 vicksonzero (Him | Web/Unity)#2295: just finished setting up socket.io and phaser, and now the game just is laggy as hell to even start.
hint: i still haven't coded the gameplay  a bit
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: *vibes*
 nekotheasparagus#0809: It could be a VN about someone losing all his lunch money betting on marble games
 adrenalyzed#5024: oh my bad
 Sappir#7051: Wait can we make two submissions, I kinda want to make a katamari game now...
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: to be clear you don't need to have literal dice rolling in the game for it to fit the theme. Please don't tell people that they are restricted to this mechanic as it's fluid it could mean randomness or gambling or dicing something or taking risks etc.
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: and this is why we removed 'adherence to the theme' as a ranking category for the jam, it rewarded obvious takes on the theme over more clever stuff
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Morning everyone!
 VinRzR#6204: if you have barely anything for your first game its already a win
 Fraserfatt#1021: gotta flex them design brains
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: I wish more people took the theme metaphorically, it’s literally just dice everywhere (mine included)
 redseiko#0001: We literally went from... a bunch of game ideas about dice to... "stonks punch things simulator" in one line. So IDK.
 Sappir#7051: Oh no, there is going to be a katamari game with a dice...
 Haagenmeister#7220: I like the theme cause it forced me to make a different game from the one I had in mind before the jam.
 Tob#1798: oof hope you get it quick
 Fraserfatt#1021: people takin the theme like a school assignment. Gotta put less pressure on yourselves!
 ◈・ Altaꐟ#9999: gamejam finishes in 6 or 7 hours later. and i just have a menu and character controls. this is my first game. and now i need to do codes and 3 parts of game.
 Tob#1798: just barely got by with my game, its pretty bare bones but hopefully you guys like it
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: 'roll of the dice' could even be something risky that isn't necessarily random
 DevByMarc#7784: bruh haha
 voithos#0258: I'm really excited to see what people came up with! 😄
 Phoenix Indie#9754: Uh oh
We woke up the big man
 redseiko#0001: I need to see how we went from the theme to our current game idea. Cause it was kind of a haze and then we got on the meme train and it went from there.
 Mark Brown#6982: you can take the theme however you want - focus on the word dice, or roll, or use another definition of the word dice
 Phallo#3476: get out
 Cearáj#9556: mine are mostly the opposite so I had a hard time thinking about it
 Sappir#7051: I love the amount of youtube videos talking about level design.
 Jolomoju#6021: I didn't like the theme at first. But then I realized this would be the perfect theme to make my first 3D game 😄
 Mark Brown#6982: "Your game should follow the theme, and you will be asked how your game fits the theme on the itch.io submission page. That being said, you will not be disqualified from the jam if your game doesn't adequately fit the theme. "
 quantum#0043: but  can the dice hold a minor role
 Mark Brown#6982: it's a weird superpower but i'll take it
 Phallo#3476: i really like the theme... just mildly disappointed how many games took it 100% literal 😛
 Tob#1798: lol, yea, guess I just had trouble with it
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: mark, how do you feel having summoned thousands of games about dice
 nekotheasparagus#0809: I like the theme 🎲 - gave me a bunch of ideas and had many interpretations
 quantum#0043:  hahahaha
 Cearáj#9556: always hated that guy in cuphead >:(
 VinRzR#6204: I loved the theme
 Amelia-chan#4996: the theme is very good imo
 Mark Brown#6982: people telling me they don't like the theme
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yeah, you don't even need to have dice in your game, you can inperpret the theme however you want and you get to justify it when you link your game so don't worry
 nekotheasparagus#0809: Not particularly- the theme can be applied to the story, so a game about someone who’s luck took a turn could be made to fit and Dangit now I have an idea I wish I had at the start of a character who has bad luck and the puzzle is using his bad luck
 vicksonzero (Him | Web/Unity)#2295: who said making a smooth io game in the jam is fun?
 quantum#0043: ok
 Amelia-chan#4996: yes, interpret the theme however you want
 Cearáj#9556: the pain of getting a two
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: lots of my favourite games use randomness as a key concept so i like the theme!
 redseiko#0001: With more time, we would've had a dice mechanic but didn't even get that far so.
 Tob#1798: thats why I hated this theme its so hard to make a fair game with
 quantum#0043:  same
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: we interpreted the theme as ‘role of the dice’ with our dnd concept
 dave_ja#4419: To quote Kurt Cobain: "I hate myself and I want two die" 🎲🎲
 Phallo#3476: mine doesnt even have anything to do with dice 😂
 Redline#7370: *I have many dice here*
 nekotheasparagus#0809: You don’t need litteral dice, the theme doesn’t have to be taken literally, just be part of the game
 Sappir#7051: I can't figure out how to make the dice innovated or more meaningful. I just roll the dice for stage difficulty.
 adrenalyzed#5024: the theme is roll the dice so sorta
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: idk I appreciate it when games incorporate the theme more meaningfully 
 quantum#0043: is it necessary? 
 adrenalyzed#5024: as long as that dice rolls
 quantum#0043: can the game actually fit the theme if the dice has a minor role?
 Artem#0069: 12 hours to go yay
 Phallo#3476: just in general, unity is really well made and documented... you dont often come across that in other languages
 redseiko#0001: I finished making the one and only dice in our game roll for one action so it fits the theme so yay. zzz
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Also unity ftw 100% if you don't look at unreal and instantly die from 9000m things being crashed into the same place, and the window layout looking horrible, then you are done kind of freak of nature with super powers
 Firepixel85#0733: good night
 redseiko#0001: Calling it for tonight. We got some stuff done pretty surprised on how much we actually made lol. Good luck everyone.
 Firepixel85#0733: unity
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Well it depends on what you mean by easier. Easier to make big well... *Games*, or easier to understand
 Cearáj#9556: godo
 9bitmax#3119: gdevelop
 voithos#0258: Thanks! 🙏
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: Unity
 Kapcpa#2087: Sounds like a lot of pain
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Lol
 Skirlez#5521: the html5 export is extremely broken btw. oh you have an asset that's scaled up too big? say goodbye to the entire game rendering for some reason
 Casterra#7763: Godot
 adrenalyzed#5024: unity
 Iron_Lemon#6223: unity, for ease of googling. Lots of resources
 Skirlez#5521: gamemaker
 Kapcpa#2087: Python + pygame
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: Pico-8 but I don't talk about it much
 Sappir#7051: Unity
 LM#4371: What engine do you guys used btw? Just curious
I used Clickteam Fusion 2.5
 wren#0640: someone commented on my submission page with some really good feedback and im currently rushing to get implemented lol
 9bitmax#3119: I used gdevelop
 Firepixel85#0733: ok good luck
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Amateur
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: I think... I think my games finally done :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
just one more play-test and ill make a build
 Omniclause#4760: good morning! it's almost 2am here in Tennessee about to crash.   Good luck finishing your game.  I think I like where mine is but might work on it some in the am.
 9bitmax#3119: yea
 Naemless#8596: i wasted all the time up to now should i just stop
 Firepixel85#0733: lol
 Sappir#7051: I swear this person has like 10 crashes in the last hour.
 Zayn#4390: I am used to it
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: heyo :D
 Kapcpa#2087: Lol i woke up with the same exact thoughts
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: You'll get used to it
 Fusoy#6101: You might want to post in 
 Firepixel85#0733: btw good morning
 Firepixel85#0733: second day 10 more hours of pain
 9bitmax#3119: i am almost finished i need to add a collision with enemies and a leaderborad
 Fusoy#6101: Working on a better thumbnail right after submitting is a must. It's the one thing that will make people download your game
 Kapcpa#2087: Am i the only one that constantly switches between thinking that "my game is good and almost even finished" and "this is horrible half of the, stuff still isnt done!"?
 Mark Brown#6982: Yes, you can (and yes, it is!)
 Zayn#4390: ik bruh
 dardasaba#9759: I think you can still edit the theme after the submission period ends yeah, although I'm not 100% sure
 Sappir#7051: Good luck!
 Sappir#7051: That is a lot of crashes.
 Snickerzilla#4948: Oh alr, ty
 9bitmax#3119: i am making a top down shooter game
 Zayn#4390: unity crash
 wren#0640: the jam ends in 12 hours
 Sappir#7051: Yep Same.
 Snickerzilla#4948: Does the jam end today or Monday? :/
 voithos#0258: Apologies if this is covered in the jam rules, but I couldn't find it anywhere. After the submission period ends, can we still edit the itch.io jam page itself (like add more screenshots, edit description, etc) or will that be locked?
 Moloch#1312: You're in similar company then
 9bitmax#3119: hello i am trying to finshing a game in one day
 Omniclause#4760: misread as you asking
 artydagr8#9791: Goodnight y'all thanks and good luck to everyone!
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: yep!
 Omniclause#4760: This is addressed in the jam rules and you can delete your game after submission period ends and if you do you are out of luck and there is no resubmitting.
 artydagr8#9791: yeah, I was worried regarding filling the little questionnaire stuff afterwards i retested after linking my build and found something wrong. So I deleted the files and put in new ones.. I'm sure it just links to the game page in general though.
 wren#0640: yeah thats fair
 Merus#7019: there's a strong chance, if you try to work while tired, all your work will just make your game worse
 Subwoofer#0066: unfortunately our project was a little too big for us to me and we wont fully make it in time
 Merus#7019: if you're in the polish phase, I'd get some sleep and look at it fresh in the morning
 wren#0640: ive got 9 levels and im pretty happy with most of them but idk i feel like i should have more content
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: it is possible to _delete_ your game after the submission period, just not to upload a new one. i can't believe i have to say this, but please don't delete your game this somehow happens to dozens of people every time
 wren#0640: im torn between just sleeping or adding more to my game
 Jeker#3389: FINAL STRETCH
 Redline#7370: the only thing that can't be changed are the game files right?
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: all other stuff on the page (including adding additional contributors) is changable after that point
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: you're fine to change the submission on the page until the submission time ends in 12 hours
 adrenalyzed#5024: when is submission time
 artydagr8#9791: okay cool, was lowkey freaking out thinking i'd have to resubmit. thanks 
 Zayn#4390: Alright time to add 1 more enemy variant n then I will make the main menu and make a tutorial level
 wren#0640: just changing the files on your submission is fine
 Zayn#4390: nothing lmfao, I just added some sound effects
 artydagr8#9791: Hey everyone. First game jam in a long time.. I uploaded and submitted, then went back to submit a newer version of my game... do i have to try and resubmit or should I be clear?
 Redline#7370: zayn, what are you doing that unity keeps crashing???
 Giga chad#0085: if u want it to be related just swap out the player with a dice or something or add a dice mechanic
 Sappir#7051: Unify your game assets style using shaders and materials
 Zayn#4390: Unity crashed again AAH
 wren#0640: this does though
 JJfriends#3686: Bruh
 Sappir#7051: Find game assets online :D?
 Omniclause#4760: I personally think it would be kind of dishonest and against the spirit of the jam to submit then.  Either way if your game doesn't do something interesting with the theme it likely won't fare very well anyways
 Jupiter_Butts#3521: sigh ok 😦
  yea is it ok? 😦 im sorry
 wren#0640: technically not using the theme doesnt disqualify you
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: are you asking if you can just upload a completely unrelated game to the jam
 LM#4371: You cant upload it then i guess
 Jupiter_Butts#3521: i started before the jam 😔
 Omniclause#4760: Did you start working on it before the jam or in a way unrelated to the jam?
 JJfriends#3686: Go solo
 MonkeyLiu#8573: Yes
 Jupiter_Butts#3521: Hi sorry, i created a game but it's not related to the theme. can i still upload it? 😦
 Redline#7370: *reasons why I don't team up for jams*
 Omniclause#4760: start grabbing art assets off of itch asap.  you likely won't be hearing from them again.
 BatYaggy#3015: Spam them?
 Redline#7370: hi guys time to pain
 Tornado#0975: guys my artist havent came online. and idk what to do
 JJfriends#3686: dude its so good idk how i made it like decent anyways gn i need sleep
 Giga chad#0085: btw I kinda said am but most of them I meant pm
 JJfriends#3686: DUDE JUST FINISHED MY GAME AND ITS SO GOOD
 artydagr8#9791: so I submitted my game.. re-tested found a bug, and re-uploaded a new version of the build... does this automatically keep my submission in for the game jam?
 Giga chad#0085: bruh I dont, I take like 30min breaks and eat
 BatYaggy#3015: Sounds unpleasant
 Valkyrrii#3264: I had to manually code in location restraints, but the byproduct movement actually looks cool.
 Wolfenrahd#3061: i know what you meant, but its funny to think that you dev for 23 hours straight
 BatYaggy#3015: 12 hours
 Lemon#7606: I spent 5 minutes, then gave up and did a workaround
 Giga chad#0085: at least u learned something right
 Pixelan#2176: 😎 *dice*
 Sappir#7051: I spent a hour trying to figure out how eular angles work T_T
 Wolfenrahd#3061: these games are looking pretty dice
 Giga chad#0085: my keyboard has to charge so I am gonna have to type with my old keyboard so I guess I'll just get the page ready
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: im so close to finishing my game. Im gonna try to build it in the next half hour
 Giga chad#0085: not bad
 PL_MoChi#2170: how's everyone doing?
 Veqsa#8120: This is my first jam i finish and i have time left, even tho i always do 3-4day game jams… so thats weird
 Veqsa#8120: Oh cool! Thanks :)
 Giga chad#0085: I mean I get enough sleep honestly, I just wake up at 6AM and work till like 5PM then eat and go outside then Come back at 6:30PM ish then just work till 12:30PM then sleep and thats the cycle
 Crusher48#2092: When you have card mechanics in your dice game and the only reason it isn't a deckbuilder is because you can't actually edit the deck
 Casper#6361: There's still 11+ hours
 Veqsa#8120: Yea its a puzzlegame
 RomketMan#0055: Alot of people sign up but submit as a group, so 3 sign ups could be for 1 submission
 Fusoy#6101: There was a math game in the top 20 last year, you should be good !
 Lemon#7606: Yeah I've already learned so much in the past 36 hours. I'll be a little upset if I don't finish or do well but this has already been awesome
 Chris10EMX#5180: Mathematically that is difficult but hopefully.
 Casper#6361: Hm what do you mean
 Sappir#7051: Wow the lack of submissions is worrying
 Merus#7019: expecting a particular ranking position before you can say it was "worth" it is madness
 GeoStarGames#8750: oh no i didn't even made more than halff and my game is full of bugs
 Veqsa#8120: I hope people dont rate my game bad because they suck at math, my main mechanic is based on basic math
 davidnjihiahere#6326: the power of lack of sleep
 RomketMan#0055: Last year had 22k sign ups and around 5k games submitted, this year seems to have similar amount of sign ups so expecting around 5/6k submitted games this year
 Chris10EMX#5180: fair point
 Merus#7019: honestly if you manage to submit something fun at _all_ you should count it as a win
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: 12.5 hours :/
 wren#0640: youtubers get a ton of medium reviews rather than a few great ones which causes them to be a bit lower in the rankings than youd expect
 Giga chad#0085: yeah exactly
 davidnjihiahere#6326: apparently my character sprites have turned to among us
 Omniclause#4760: hard agree
 Veqsa#8120: I was kidding btw
 GeoStarGames#8750: does anybody know how much time left?
 Lemon#7606: my goal is top 100, but this is my first jam so I don't have any expectations
 Giga chad#0085: I just care if I am in the top 5K or 3K
 Chris10EMX#5180: My biggest concern are huge youtube channels that would get tons of plays and great reviews
 wren#0640: i doubt over a quarter will submit
 Veqsa#8120: 20k games also means more then 20k people… because people are in teams, and play more the 1 game, should be good
 Giga chad#0085: yeserday I had 1 thing left and today I have 5 cuz I am keep getting ideas that I have time for
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: yea i dont think my game will even be seen 😐
 Veqsa#8120: I hope i get atleast in the top 10, otherwise it was all for nothing
 Sappir#7051: The closest jam number I seen is like 1k on itch.io jam page
 Chris10EMX#5180: Damn
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: like over 20K people
 Crusher48#2092: It might still get extended because of unprecedented circumstances but don't count on that
 yumaikas#3530: So many
 Giga chad#0085: How to check ur position after the jam?
 Lemon#7606: Fair enough. Gotta get my game to a submit-able state first though lol
 Chris10EMX#5180: How many people are competing?
 Fraserfatt#1021: Finished. so happy this duct taped mess is off my shoulders.  I could *Not* get sound implemented and I have no time left personally 😭
 Giga chad#0085: Idk
 Sappir#7051: You can check your position? How do you do that?
 nekotheasparagus#0809: Uninstall it as a threat /j
 zyugyzarc#0314: just finished my game, feeling confident
 Giga chad#0085: u can just say like 1000 people are in front of u and ur just better then ALL of them
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: Unity crashed so many times, I want to crash it.
But if I do, I will have no computer.
 Lemon#7606: I've never actually finished and built a game in unity so I hope I don't run into any issues there lol
 Delphine Noel#1196: Good morning
 Chris10EMX#5180: Lol
 Veqsa#8120: My fear is that unity doesnt manage to build in time 💀
 Crusher48#2092: Better to miss out on some polishing and submit at 2 PM than to try to submit at 2:55 and run into unexpected issues
 davidnjihiahere#6326: I did that many times
 Tob#1798: got mine just good enough, but it's still terrible 😂
 Giga chad#0085: guys if ur not even in the top 19K lets say ur at 20690 place ok dont be sad cuz it means that ur better than 1000 other people
 Lemon#7606: I did that once and slept through an exam.  Not fun
 Crusher48#2092: Honestly I would not recommend last-minute submitting because there's no buffer window for submission afterwards
 Chris10EMX#5180: I hope I can just get my project to the point where I am happy with it.
 Veqsa#8120: Its already 8am for me, been working al night
 Giga chad#0085: ***Dont try this at home kids*** "Lemme just snooze my alarm thats set at 6AM" if I snooze it I cant stop snoozing it
 Scolon#4218: Im going to submit at around 4-5 hours pre-deadline and then do hourly submissions
 Chienaun#0846: 'night y'all
 Lemon#7606: I don't plan on sleeping until after I submit, probably 5 minutes before the deadline. so almost 3pm my time
 Veqsa#8120: Im scared of laying down because ill prob fall asleep for the rest of the jam 💀
 davidnjihiahere#6326: the player disappears while scaling a wall. It's super annoying
 Chienaun#0846: same
 Giga chad#0085: well I ***dont***
 Lemon#7606: sleep is for the weak
 Scolon#4218: Well i have a few things to do in the morning, shouldn't take too much time hopefully
Time for sleep
 Giga chad#0085: does anyone have time to playtest my game
 davidnjihiahere#6326: my mechanics are still super broken
 Sappir#7051: This is what I'm doing rn. I just spent 3 hours fine tuning my dice roll.
 Giga chad#0085: Lol The giga chad never sleeps
 Lemon#7606: I have too much caffeine in my system to sleep
 Chris10EMX#5180: The Giga chad unfazed by the pressure
 Giga chad#0085: Idk why but even if I submit I would still not sleep cuz I just don't feel like lol
 Lemon#7606: I spent all day on dice physics instead of making enemy AI 🙃
 Endorth#5797: Yeaaayy I submited my game! Now I can sleep 😁😁😁😁
 davidnjihiahere#6326: the problem with depth is that it's more difficult to teach the player
 Zayn#4390: holy
 Giga chad#0085: bruh thats literaly me in everygame my previous game I addd multiplayer fps and I forgot to add jumping
 Chris10EMX#5180: Nice, deeper not wider.
 Shooby#1860: relatable
 yumaikas#3530: _doesn't have any levels yet, but has 6 enemy types, and 6 gadgets for defending them_
 Lukey#6052: I'm very hungry. Actually so hungry in fact that I'm losing productivity by procrastinating in the discord server. Hopefully my spaghetti will hurry up and get cooked.
 Giga chad#0085: yeah I thought that first I didnt realy wanted to but like if I didnt my game would be gone and Thsi is my first GMTK game jam and its my 3rd game jam of all time so I am prety glad i did
 davidnjihiahere#6326: not even a single level yet but I'm getting close
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: im very tired rn lol
 Lemon#7606: Imagine being responsible and making backups, couldn't be me
 Sappir#7051: I wonder if someone is going to make a casino game.
 Giga chad#0085: it costed 30 to find where I put that backup I made yesterday
 Lemon#7606: I had the same thing happen to me. Thankfully scripts and other assets aren't saved by unity. Only cost me an hour or so
 Giga chad#0085: damn its 8AM for me lol
 NoFace#5304: I deadass saw the word dice in the game names and I said, "Oh... Dice~"
 NoFace#5304: I just saw 2 games from 2 devs I follow on itch and I guessed quickly they're in the jam lmao
 Chris10EMX#5180: Sorry bro, when the jam started UE5 crashed every time I created a new project for like half an hour. Can be pretty annoying.
 Lukey#6052: Oh no!
 Zayn#4390: Unity Crashed.
 Chris10EMX#5180: Nice, I m almost done as well completed the menu maybe some more polish. Build and Upload.
 Lukey#6052: Going great! Game is kinda finished, just needs a lotttt of polish and some extra small features. Panicking a little but I should be okay after dinner (spaghetti!).
 Ahat#0842: its 11 pm for me
 Cearáj#9556: timezones moment
 Chris10EMX#5180: Hey everyone, how's it going
 BadPiggy#5202: Damn
 dardasaba#9759: 9 am for me
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: goodmorning chat
 Dat_WeirdPerson#3654: 2 am
 Cearáj#9556: 3 am
 Lukey#6052: Ha its 6pm for me
 BatYaggy#3015: Ha its 11pm for me
 CodingLord#1012: Well its almost afternoon but still morning so, Good Morning! Good Luck!
 Moloch#1312: Oh god it is morning. oh GOD
 Sappir#7051: Morning!
 dardasaba#9759: Good morning!
Excited to get working on day 2!
 Jasper#7906: Good morning jammers!
 GameDude#3494: I actually made a 2d platformer with a NON-random dice
 Sappir#7051: That's good, its kinda scary being the odd one out. (Like you're missing something)
 Capybara#8868: ye ive 100% seen a good couple of those
 Moloch#1312: FPS here, too
 Crusher48#2092: I made a 3D board game roguelike in Unity and I don't do 3D in Unity like ever
 BadPiggy#5202: Pretty sure you ain't the only one
There are a few other peeps doing FPS's
 Arleycht#7791: that would advantageously make your entry unique 👀
 Sappir#7051: I feel like I'm the only person who made a 3d fps dice  shooting game ._.
 quantum#0043: lol xd
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: I would definitely be confused by 'cells' with no context
 Selviam#7268: yeah im not finishing this im time i gotta wake up early tomorrow and i get 0 time to work on it tomorrow
 BadPiggy#5202: Dots it is then kek
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: or dots
 BadPiggy#5202: Lol. Though calling them points should definitely be universally understood
 quantum#0043: hahahahaha]
 Moloch#1312:  like this
 Viola_Buddy#6763: If we submitted an earlier version of the game to the jam, and then updated the game, do we have to do anything to update the submission, or will it point to the newest version of the game?
 Moloch#1312: I say use "points" and tell 'em they're called pips after
 Zayn#4390: Good luck to u too 🙂
 Mr Craft(Ron)#5112: thanks
 BatYaggy#3015: I use zips. Just package however available and then ya submit the zip file.
 BadPiggy#5202: If I refer to the pips of the die as cells, do you think most people would understand it ?
Cus I'm pretty sure most peeps may not know about the term " pips " lol
 ccsrgamer01#2711: just asking how do we submit the game through itch.io?
do we zip it?
 Camsoh#7358: Hey yall, good morning! Good luck with your game today 😀
 Zayn#4390: Awesome! thanks 😄
 Sappir#7051: Good luck Mr craft
 Mr Craft(Ron)#5112: re-writing the whole game because of too many unknown bugs :(
 RK#2024: Nope!
 StuartXYZ#1675: oki
 Zayn#4390: ah okay, thanks 🙂 so do I need to give them credit ?
 Moloch#1312: "Stomp the points on the die (fun fact, they're called pips!)"
 RK#2024: Generally speaking for most professional music products, they are licensed for you to make your own music with. You are not allowed to redistribute the original beats as-is, but can freely use them in your creations
 Ahat#0842: think its freeuse
 Zayn#4390: what is the license?
 Jolly Ask#0856: Argh no there’s so much wordplay potential there, can’t believe I’m only finding that out 32 hours in
 BadPiggy#5202: Do you think people will understand if I say it though kek
The tutorial in my game is " stomp the pips on the die " basically
 M_Raven#4076: Google says they’re called pips
 RK#2024: Pips
 Ahat#0842: wdym?
 Sappir#7051: Game jam progress pictures
 BadPiggy#5202: Guys, what do you call the dots on a die ?
 Zayn#4390: license?
 Ahat#0842: yup
 StuartXYZ#1675: where can i post a gif of my game
 ZorroTamalito#0956: I did have fun tho
 ZorroTamalito#0956: indeed. If I'm going to quit at least the game should have some more content
is funny because everything I built can be used for designing levels right away
 Zayn#4390: this is free right??
 Sappir#7051: Think of a idea --> strip it of all the excess ideas --> It becomes a platformer
 ZorroTamalito#0956: 😭
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: Well, it should be good enough as it is
Ites defenitely an improvment from the first build you shown us 🙂
 JesusSVasquez#1009: Tu puedes Tamalito
 ZorroTamalito#0956: yeah, I won't finish this game in time
 Zayn#4390: Anyone know any good websites where I can get good audio ?
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: You're quitting?
 Ahat#0842: mods in the 2 extra hours to upload can i still work on my game?
 Danny Dan Dan#6699: Holy crap let me make sure I at least hit save before I shut down my pc 😰
 Iron_Lemon#6223: Link me please :0
 Ahat#0842: i still need to make some texttures too. tommorow im gonna do the finishing touches
 Zayn#4390: good good, just dying inside
 Lukey#6052: yeah I'm gonna make music too.
 Ahat#0842: im looking at some free lofi music kits to quickly make some background music
 Lemon#7606: Yeah the goal should just be to have something playable. Doesn't have to be exactly how you wanted it
 Iron_Lemon#6223: Lord audio. I need audio. Gonna go download random sound effects and get splicing.
 belzimbub#1594: Hello there! How r u?
 Zayn#4390: imma go make some audio tracks in music maker
 Lukey#6052: True!
 RomketMan#0055: I have been rewatching gmtk's developing series while jamming, and its reassuring to se that his prototype of the magnet guy took 30 days, in which the scope, design, art and changed massively. We are trying the same task in 48 hours, so having something 100% perfect is unlikely, so it's best to have fun and enjoy the learning process
 Zayn#4390: hang in there brother!
 williamdoro#8857: building alpha v0.4
 Ahat#0842: man, i dont know if im gonna finish my game
 Zayn#4390: Making a Game for a game jam is like working on a farm all day on a sunny day 🤣
 Moloch#1312: Also something to note, you don't have to stop once the jam is over. If you got a good idea, keep going after and flesh it out more. Could be that you get a nice bit of itch.io fame or get your product picked up by some content creators.
 Danny Dan Dan#6699: Personally I'm gonna try to get a good sleep, then do my best to crank out something playable in the morning
 Lemon#7606: That's every game jam game though
 Phoenix Indie#9754: Mine is just a glorified prototype
 Jeker#3389: there are 13 hours left, and i dont think i've done enough progress. Time to push this out
 Iron_Lemon#6223: Everybody is going to end up with something between 0% and 100% complete, I think everybody should be proud that they are taking part, learning, and not watching youtube.
 SomeTingOdd#8346: yeah same :) i was worried i was behind because i spent some time today doing chores and napping but it seems a lot of people are at the same spot as me
 Phoenix Indie#9754: Same
 Danny Dan Dan#6699: Honestly seeing people in this chat talking about not finishing or having something barebones is very reassuring to me
 Sappir#7051: I'm still trying to figure out my concept
 Kapcpa#2087: Well i didnt know i could do as many little stupid bugs as i did
 SomeTingOdd#8346: same here! i think just completing a decent game within a 48 hour period is still a huge accomplishment :) mine's not very great but im happy just to be taking part in this
 CodingLord#1012: I barely have a game
 grong dong bongle#6426: bloody mood, i learned that i forgot half of gdscript about 30 minutes into the jam
 M_Raven#4076: I’m not even finishing lmao
 CodingLord#1012: I was just checking the attitude you guys have. You should not care about winning but rather have fun.
 Kapcpa#2087: Just wanna end a game thats somewhat fun for everyone at this point lol, i thought i was prepared for it
 grong dong bongle#6426: i'm just here to figure out where my weak spots are so i can figure out how to patch them up. i think my biggest is. uh. ui/ux. i am not good with those.
 Iron_Lemon#6223: 100% can't lose. Just gotta finish the last 95% of my game and get playtested before 2:30 tmrw.
 Lemon#7606: I'm just rolling the dice 🙃
 iofractorg#6427: Yeah naaahhh lol but idc
 adrenalyzed#5024: i dont care about winning that much i just wanna have fun
 CodingLord#1012: How confident are you all that you will win this Game Jam?
 Kapcpa#2087: Well thats what i learned, i think that if i tweak some think here and there it will be okay again, because, i think my base concept is pretty good
 Iron_Lemon#6223: Not to mention teammates, reusable code, or custom assets
 grong dong bongle#6426: arguably that's not the 48 hours they had, but the hundreds upon hundreds of hours of practice beforehand
 Iron_Lemon#6223: Bloat can kill your concept real quick
 Kapcpa#2087: Well my game dont have that many bugs i think but the problem is that the core game play is vanishing as im adding new stuff
 Iron_Lemon#6223: Besides competent people who aren't you obviously smh
 FryDev#0372: *ahem* past gmtk winners
 adrenalyzed#5024: whats a good way to post a mp4 file without compressing it
 grong dong bongle#6426: i have been trying to get aiming working for a few hours now. it's not good. but it's aiming where you look. perhaps once i wake i may finish up enemy logic, make a simply crappy level, build and submit.
 Iron_Lemon#6223: As long as you learned from making it you're golden. Nobody creates gold in 48 hours.
 FryDev#0372: which is disappointing, since I did sort of like my idea
 FryDev#0372: I think I'm just going to submit a buggy mess. I don't really care about my game anymore, and even if I stay up to work on it, it's still not going to be good. I just want to be able to rate the other games
 Kapcpa#2087: Damn just woke up, 11,5h left on clock!
 Snage#1337: or just let them choose/have multiple things happen if they land on a 6
 Danny Dan Dan#6699: Personally I'm hoping I can at least get a working proof of concept submitted by the deadline so I can get some eyes on it. I think my concept is pretty interesting but this is my first jam and I severely underestimated how productive I can be in such a short amount of time lol
 Cyanberry#3882: I can say I can submit now yay!
 Selviam#7268: or would it be a good idea to make it so only 3 sides of the dice can make a move so the player would have to move the dice in a way to line up its next attack
 Kurutte#3765: I can finally say I actually almost have a game now lol
 nekotheasparagus#0809: If people like the idea I might, I’m not sure if my gameplay is fun (can’t really judge it well myself becuase I’ve been staring at the dang thing for hours)
 Snage#1337: Crit?, or another turn?
 Boiman Prime#7677: Movement option maybe?
 Quinnster#8573: I just plan on refining whatever buggy mess I have by the end of it into something a bit more playable
 Cyanberry#3882: Special attack?
 MaryStrawberry#4672: raise your hand if it's midnight for someone here
 Ahnaf30e#3408: if it does good-ish... imma work on it after za jam
if not... SIDE PROJECT TIME BABYEEEEEE
 Selviam#7268: in my game so far i have 5 moves for each side, attack 1, attack 2, heal 3, heal 4, and defending and i just need ooooone more easy to code move for the 6th side any suggestions?
 Boiman Prime#7677: we might, but this is our first time doing a jam, and most of our first times even touching game dev
 Danny Dan Dan#6699: I'm curious, how many people are planning to keep working on their game after the jam is over?
 Boiman Prime#7677: mood
 Quinnster#8573: I reaaaally should go to bed buuuuut...
 mrCamelCase#2782: to anyone who's still up: reminder to stay hydrated!
 Iron_Lemon#6223: amen
 FryDev#0372: my game is going to be barely playable
 Sappir#7051: Finishing something is something to be proud of 🙂
 wren#0640: just use the basic tenets of squash and stretch and youll be fine
 Quinnster#8573: Same situation lol
 Iron_Lemon#6223: Never done any animation before and I'm god awful at art but my goal was solely to finish something, not to be proud of it
 Iron_Lemon#6223: game is going alright gameplay is hammered out mostly, gotta start cramming in levels and polish asap
 wren#0640: im at a point where if i slept past the deadline id still have pretty full game  submitted so pretty well
 Cyanberry#3882: theres a problem with one level so I'll have to build again
 Iron_Lemon#6223: Just joined the disc while I update my unity version for render features, never done a game jam before and likely aint gonna be sleeping much
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: And really you should give credit anyway even if it's not required. Can't hurt
 Valkyrrii#3264: How are y'all's games going atm?
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: Yes. Make sure you're meeting any crediting requirements
 wren#0640: my end screen tells you overall how many level resets you had to use >:)
 Sappir#7051: We're allowed to use purchased assets right?
 BatYaggy#3015: Together we can make people cooler around the globe
 Cyanberry#3882: 
 BatYaggy#3015: Sure
 gnarbro#1627: Is anyone interested in playing my trash game and providing some feedback?
 M_Raven#4076: Tbh I’m kinda ok with it now, it’s gonna make me feel upset but if we don’t finish I’m planning on reusing the concept for a personal project
 Ahnaf30e#3408: hippity hoppity ur endscreen sentence is now my property
 BatYaggy#3015: Ah ty
 MetalGearSamus#0001: Okay, thank you!
 BatYaggy#3015: Ha my ending is just the words "ur cool"
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: There are no limits before the submission period ends. Upload a new build every twenty minutes if you want to
 M_Raven#4076: You can upload multiple times, I’m talking about after the deadline
 BatYaggy#3015: You can only upload once?
 M_Raven#4076: I don’t think my team’s finishing, we have only the core concept done and no levels or polishing at all
 MetalGearSamus#0001: So we can upload updated versions if there's still time left? Or we can't?
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: Yes
 Jhunter#4054: Cool. In that case gotta hit the hay before I die lol
 BarioIDL#2522: all i have r player and cubes
 M_Raven#4076: I believe the only thing you won’t be able to change is the game upload itself
 BatYaggy#3015: Nooooooooooooooooo
 Jhunter#4054: If I submit the game tonight can I still change the itch page itself tomorrow even after the deadline? Like image, gifs, description?
 BarioIDL#2522: sad
 katiepotatoes#1609: I’m so freaking sad and i need to vent. My game is done and i was about to upload it but my laptop turned off and won’t turn back on. i’m gonna cry i worked so hard and now i won’t get to enter it :((
 BatYaggy#3015: Ya I'm too bad to make cutscenes
 GameDude#3494: I'm new to animation so stuff like that would probably take multiple days for me. GMTK jams have some of the tightest time restrictions out of all the jams that I entered. 48 hours is really hard to work with, especially if you have things going on in life.
 ZorroTamalito#0956: lol
 BatYaggy#3015: To do that correctly, he must fire the lead designer
 Sappir#7051: People put in cutscenes?
 ZorroTamalito#0956: the MGSV Third Act treatment, I see
 Ahnaf30e#3408: cutscenes for me should only take about... 2 hours so i am gud to go :D))
 GameDude#3494: I'm skipping cutscenes entirely, I'm just putting story & mechanics in description. Way too much to do.
 Ahnaf30e#3408: ouch
 FryDev#0372: my mechanic is completely broken
 Ahnaf30e#3408: ok my friend allowed me to use his music :D
i can make cutscenes then since almost all of my game is pretty much done
 GameDude#3494: Thankfully there's a ton of free music/art available, otherwise it would have been an insane time-drain for me to make all these by myself, along with coding, designing & debugging the entire game
 wren#0640: its just claire redfield with groucho marx glasses
 Cyanberry#3882: finally i can build
 Merus#7019: Good edit
 Giga chad#0085: but now my project is called 0.2 lol
 adrenalyzed#5024: congrats! mods dont like it when u use caps alot so dont do that pls
 Giga chad#0085: bruh I was so scared but finaly i didn't lose *any* progress at all
 Giga chad#0085: Omg les go i just realized I made a backup yesterday
 Zayn#4390: ye same bro
 adrenalyzed#5024: i think there are tutorials on how to find backups but idk
 Sappir#7051: Maybe you could give her different clothes?
 Giga chad#0085: I might be able to open a olp backup tho but I still would lose all my progress from yesterday
 Giga chad#0085: bruh my pinky and middlefinger are just **glued** to ctrl + s
 Jupiter_Butts#3521: i know because you guys said stolen assets not allowed. so i created one from scratch an exact replica of claire redfield. is it still ok? 😦
 Merus#7019: That's not what you were telling us yesterday
 adrenalyzed#5024: it auto saves when u press the play button
 nekotheasparagus#0809: If you didn’t save the scene before the crash it might be gone
 adrenalyzed#5024: check your recycle bin
 Giga chad#0085: not realy but my game scene just ***de exist now idk why I am so scared***
 nekotheasparagus#0809: That’s the worst part about code. It does EXACTLY what you tell it to
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: Actually youre right, since the code can just can just tell you "no" and throw a million errors at you. Just like a toddler
 Cyanberry#3882: did you make a script instantiate itself
 R4zorcl4w77#9100: dude none of my previous jam gsmes had sfx or music due to running out of time, i feel ya
 Giga chad#0085: bruh my unity crashed
 nekotheasparagus#0809: “Why aren’t you working?????”
*told code to loop through all children and not check if they were even what I wanted*
 Lukey#6052: I'm honestly stressing a little bit. But so far I've got the bare minimum (bare bare minimum), so I'll use these last few hours to make it better! More polish, more juice, and - oh oh no. Just as writing this I realised I have zero sound effects or music.
 adrenalyzed#5024: doesnt feel like it tho
 nekotheasparagus#0809: Sometimes I forget that code is a toddler really keen on doing exactly what you tell it to
 Zayn#4390: lukey welcome back from sleep
 Giga chad#0085: das crazy
 Sappir#7051: I just started a couple hours ago...
 CookiesRiot#2732: yeah loving that i had to work all day yesterday and then, you know, sleep like a normal human...
 Lukey#6052: ooooooooooooooooooooooooo 14 hours to gooo oh noooo
 clay#7015: Awesome, I just had some last minute jitters, I was worried I missed some window or something. Ty :)
 Cyanberry#3882: just submit whenever ya want before the deadline and after the jam starts
 clay#7015: Wait did we need to enter the game jam on itchio earlier or can we just submit when we’re ready
 Super#7038: Im giving up for tonight.
 Jupiter_Butts#3521: its not like i steal any assets, i just created one looks like her
 krisis in a jar#0904: i'll scream if the windows build doens't work
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: Nice lol
 krisis in a jar#0904: I CAN FINALLY GO TO SLEEP, THANK GOD!!!
 Zayn#4390: Congrats
 Jupiter_Butts#3521: hi im just wondering, i created a model looks just like claire redfield. It is ok right?
 krisis in a jar#0904: Just uploaded my game!
 Zayn#4390: ?
 Cyanberry#3882: ..............
 Zayn#4390: Unity lmao
 FryDev#0372: same
 GameDude#3494: Still lots of stuff to do. Guess bed is not for me today.
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: No, im using Unity, what are you using?
 Zayn#4390:  are u using scratch?
 Scolon#4218: Well, taking a step back I just need to add a few small things I could call this game complete...
Still need a music track and a few small pieces of content to flesh out the ideas present..
I'll have like, 5 or 6 hours to dev in the morning
 Ceding Tree#1081: to be fair, I'm just here for to get better at making games and hopefully make some new friends 😄
 gnarbro#1627: I'm in the same spot for my game lol - good job getting something in! Are we allowed to share the itch.io links to our games on here for feedback?
 TheChronicPhenix#1205: Well it's submitted, it's not a game yet, but, there's at least there's some gameplay you can mess around with that conveys the concept for the jam, hopefully I can make it actually something before this thing wraps up
 Ceding Tree#1081: Just posted what I've got so far on the game jam progress picture channel if y'all want to see a preview video! I could use help thinking of a title
 Alai#0673: maybe i will start over
 Cyanberry#3882: Anyone have a final puzzle level idea?
 9bitmax#3119: hello i am 9bitmax i just started make the game  like 4 hours ago
 nicompany#4718: thanks!
 ZorroTamalito#0956: in 14 hours, 43 minutes and 25 seconds aprox.
 Zayn#4390: nice nice
 Ceding Tree#1081: I ended up just making an overlay for the title and shop in my game that I set active or inactive. Really just cause I didnt want to deal with scene management
 katiepotatoes#1609: lol just a seperate scene for the title
 Ceding Tree#1081: you have more than one scene? 🤣  thats better than I've got lol
 katiepotatoes#1609: My game is done, but the build looks bad >.< one scene is more zoomed in than the rest
 clay#7015: Basic functionality done, just need ui! The game is playable through text at this point (it’s turnbased)
 CoolRyan#6539: kinda just want to be able to poke around in the channels over time and see how things came to gether for people - progress media chan is really interesting for me - don't want to lose it 😭
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: pretty good, im working on my final level rn 🙂
 Zayn#4390: How's everyones game going?
 Beeg scarf#3571: what resolution do you guys use for your game
 clay#7015: Wait really? That’s 2 hours earlier than I thought
 nicompany#4718: thanks!
 BurgerWizard#8683: Ok guys, gonna start making the game
 EmeraldAlkemist#4601: 
 clay#7015: That’s a really tough skill. I wrote an article once and it took me like 3 weeks just to get it to a point where it made sense
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: tomorrow at 2pm CST
 LOPSTERu#3902: in 13 hours
 nicompany#4718: hi guys! When will jam end? I cant open ichio to look(
 davidnjihiahere#6326: yeah. I wrote a few. I feel like it comes down to making words be interesting without confusing people. And I like to be abstract with words
 clay#7015: Books plural? That’s awesome
 davidnjihiahere#6326: I feel this. I've written books. But when it comes to games, I feel very unsure
 Yollie#2239: On the bright side though my musician finished his music track and it’s an absolute banger
 ZorroTamalito#0956: the changes will be deployed soon after Gitlab CI/CD finishes
 clay#7015: If you like writing dialogue, I have a story mod I’m working on for Outer Wilds (not part of this game jam) I have the whole story done but I can’t write dialogue to save my life. If you’re interested I’d love if you wanted to write a few conversations
 ZorroTamalito#0956: cool I figured out for my game how to keep moving the hero while the direction key is pressed and held
 Alai#0673: i think my games will be a failure cuz the mechanic is done but i don't have a clear goal
 jschwitzer#0421: Rip this is why I’m trying to stay up all night tonight
 quantum#0043: i cant finish my own games level
 Yollie#2239: Well it happened to me 💀
My alarm didn’t work today
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: ouch. Thats the #1 thing im worried about in this jam.
 davidnjihiahere#6326: reminds me of a game I saw in the pico 8. It was called seinfield simulator I believe, one of the most unique games I've seen. I like these kinds of games
 Jackcats0#4141: It’s a bit more shallow than I want it to be though cause I only had time for two suspects. It was fun to write the dialogue though
 Alai#0673: i've never seen a game like that except la noire
 clay#7015: ooooh that's really interesting! that's a rare genre
 katiepotatoes#1609: Has anyone else had an issue with the screen zooming in weird when building unity webgl?
 Jackcats0#4141: Thanks! It’s an interrogation game where a dice roll tells you have suspicious your suspect is of you. If they’re too suspicious you can’t ask them any more questions. At the end you have to use the information you got from the interrogations to figure out who the culprit of the crime was
 Yollie#2239: I somehow woke up at 2pm today 💀 I have like no time for the jam
 clay#7015: early! nice job! what's the game about
 ZorroTamalito#0956: indeed
 ZorroTamalito#0956: thank you! I had to read about easing funcitons 😬  and chose the best
 Jackcats0#4141: I finally finished my game!!!
 sendhelpidfk#6700: sounds cool, but polishing before you have an MVP makes it hard to judge how well the game works in practice
 ZorroTamalito#0956: thank you!
 clay#7015: idk about the discord, sorry. I'd say make sure to grab anything you for sure need after you submit your game
 ZorroTamalito#0956: I'm struggling to figure how to keep moving on echoing keys, I'll add that as soon as I can figure that out
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: damn that movement is smooth, the the transitions are nice too, good job 😄
 CoolRyan#6539: and the discord game jam stuff will be closed but viewable to read thereafter? thx!
 clay#7015: the videos are my favorite part of the jam tbh
 grong dong bongle#6426: where might i rant about the game idea i came up with so that i can get the ideas out of my mind and clear my head for actual designing?
 ZorroTamalito#0956: thank you! is an asset from Kenney (1-Bit Pack from Kenney Assets 3)
 clay#7015: around a week or two usually I think. maybe three? around that
 davidnjihiahere#6326: Mark usually plays the games before posting a video usually livestreams
 Mystical_Pidgeon#1588: Just submitted - need to playtest more tomorrow but I think it's solid 🤞
 ZorroTamalito#0956: The game is going to be about you invoking good luck or bad luck to help you traverse a scenerio
 Zayn#4390: 15 Hours left in my time zone 😮
 clay#7015: I'd like to be able to hold down the arrow keys to keep moving is the only thing I'd say
 CoolRyan#6539: how long after the deadline does the youtube jam video take to usually come out?
 Zayn#4390: Good Morning/Night (morning for me) everybody, hows everybodys game going?
 davidnjihiahere#6326: impressive
 clay#7015: nice transition effect! the level design is also really intuitive, I knew where the door was immediately even though it looks very similar to the walls. the style kinda reminds me of baba is you
 sendhelpidfk#6700: seems polished, but what's your game's elevator pitch?
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: for me, not that much, but im becoming less motivated
 jschwitzer#0421: Over use of caffeine? Or just going hard in the paint?
 CodingLord#1012: Its a brand new day for me, the final day. I have so much to do :(
 ZorroTamalito#0956: Thank you!
 Wames#8409: dude i am so tired
 Quinnster#8573: Movement feels great!
 ZorroTamalito#0956: ayyy noooo
 Chazi b#4006: Same here, 50/50 really
 clay#7015: good luck!
 FryDev#0372: I hope that even with staying up all night I can still finish
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: i love how on the first day a jam starts, everyones excited and then the next day, everyones stressed out and having problems (myself included lol)
no core mechanics yet, because I realise how inexperienced I am for doing games
 Chazi b#4006: Not if your key mechanic is to slow down time 😉
 Tapu#9161: post jam bug fixing
 clay#7015: it's midnight here and I just got my team's game to a fully working gameplay loop! I've finally earned the right to sleep
 Aiminer357#8033: that will be impressive considering its another 15 hours
 davidnjihiahere#6326: I feel like I'll pull a 24 hour today
 Chazi b#4006: aaaahhhh unity keeps crashing 😭
 FryDev#0372: now all I have to do is stay up all night and finish my list
 Aiminer357#8033: this is your reminder to drink water
 Scolon#4218: Are you guys staying hydrated?
 davidnjihiahere#6326: I'm also moving fairly well
 sendhelpidfk#6700: i have traded in my caffeine for sugar, hopefully i can finish mvp tonight and polish tomorrow
 FryDev#0372: I got the mechanic working!!!!! hooray
 Soup#3034: plus i want extra time to make my itch page good
 Soup#3034: i hope i can finish in time
 FryDev#0372: I'm so close to getting it working yet so far away
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: why is Twinkle Twinkle Little star stuck in my head? >_<
 wren#0640: ive learned from past jams that i do *not* do physics based mechanics well under a time limit
 MikeHazeJr#6582: This was me yesterday. Spent most of the day making a physically-based mechanic, and then totally changed the whole idea. I still think I'll be better off though, at least. Good luck!
 Unclouded#9240: too bad i had to restart too many times
 Tapu#9161: I'm drinking coffee rn ☕
 Unclouded#9240: i made it farther then in the last jam
 CoolRyan#6539: what's a decent pin board for game jam teams - a space to gather stuff from all over the net as well as assets screen grabs media etc? i can think of pinterest . . . tia!
 BadPiggy#5202: Reminds me, I need some coffee
 Ceding Tree#1081: "caffeine" ;D
 Wames#8409: Dude the amount of caffeine I'm on right now . . .
 FryDev#0372: I've spent 5 hours on this mechanic, and I think I'll have to scrap it. joy
 gnarbro#1627: Thank you everyone! 🙂
I had a blast, and will be participating in the GMTK jam next year as well... hopefully with a lot more skills by then haha.
I'll be looking to do a couple other contests this year before then too! This lit a fire under me to get some stuff done which was exactly what I needed!
 Minus#1843: alright, seems my head deciding to crash with keyboard is quite good indiciation I need at least 3-4 hours of sleep, that will make things easier after some sleep. Cause now I am going to make much more mistakes than really needed things. So I'm going to collide with bed for some time. cya later.
 RiverDog#8199: im stoked to see all the cool games
 Ceding Tree#1081: ~12 hours left folks! Good luck to everyone!
 Veqsa#8120: Thanks! Great to see that you liked it :)
 Minus#1843: Good to hear, Keep up your work! And remember to take part in other jams in future, it is amazing way to test your skills and hone your abilities
 Veqsa#8120: Ah nice 💀
 RiverDog#8199: cool, mines building now.  its not finished, but thats ok i gained some skills and some appreciation for what some folks can do.  also first solo gamejam
 Minus#1843: yeah, I had few hours of looking why character was going out of axis it was supposed to walk on. Turns out I forgot that only reference point I had was slowly drifting away by physics, and character was snapped on axis all this time :V
 gnarbro#1627: Hey everyone, just wanted to share that this is my first game jam and I just submitted my game online! Was super nervous to try this out because I only just started making games at the start of the Summer, but I figured this would be a great learning experience and fun! I'm super happy that I took part of this and will be participating in more jams in the future! Thank you to everyone that's helped me on here the past day or so, and good luck with your games!
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: alright, *finally* onto the last level of my game. HOPEFULLY i wont need to type anymore code
 Veqsa#8120: read this
💀
 Minus#1843: This one maneuver will cost us 40 years
 RiverDog#8199: gg
 Pixstatic#3464: goodbye library folder, you will be missed
 Minus#1843: or maybe it leaved party 2 years ago? Dunno, kinda empty sound when hitting head, so yeah, maybe I annihilated it a long time ago, and didn't even noticed '-'
 Veqsa#8120: same 💀
 Minus#1843: me, but as you can see my brain decided to leave party like 2 hours ago, and well... you see result
 RiverDog#8199: thats great, its like a thumnail sketch but for game ideation
 Veqsa#8120: Anyone from europe still up?
 Minus#1843: I might have more interesting ideas, some of them are not well suited for general public tho, so not sharing them here :>
 RiverDog#8199: OK I learned a lot in a short time.  Thats cool
 Minus#1843: And remember! Integral from burger is cow + c
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: happy birthday 🙂
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Yea yea dw I'll take another four hours of sleep. Maybe if I'm lucky I can playtest some more games before my guests arrive.
 Ceding Tree#1081: just posted my progress in game jam progress pictures. Someone should check it out and give me some feedback plz!
 Minus#1843: also  happy bday, now go sleep. Or drink more water, or drink more water and sleep? or maybe drink water squared and then make square root of sleep?
 Lukey#6052: 10
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: -5 /s
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Good luck on the games! I've playtested some amazing ones yesterday. Everyone made such great things so I'm sure yours will be good too!
 Tapu#9161: Oo happy birthday 
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: *vibes in bday* hello and bye cus its 5 am and i just went down for a glass of water I need more sleep Xd
 Minus#1843: like you know I once tried to use 🥚 on 🪴... but that does not result in 🍆 ... false advertising or something
 Tapu#9161: I still have no clue what art style to use
 Mike_7926#2285: triple for a bruise
 UniversalAsshole#4809: 🤓
 Minus#1843: does 🍆  counts?
 WorkingJoe#4433: Anyone wants to try to make *plant*?
 adrenalyzed#5024: ok ty
 Minus#1843: most people would go with dark is not available probably, but you can do something different
 Quinnster#8573: I think lighter would be better
 Minus#1843: go with whatever you like, and add some explanation in form of some text ingame what is walkable and what not I guess
 adrenalyzed#5024: should the darker parts or the lighter parts of my map be walkable bc idk which one is confusing or not
 Minus#1843: you can finish it, I believe in you, and all other people who are close but have doubts, **you can do it!!**
 Alai#0673: same
 The Mayday Man#8467: ive only made four levels and im trying to do ten but im already in "it's basically done" mental mode
 Minus#1843: and if someone sleeps it is perfectly fine to draw weird stuff on their faces, no mercy for traitors
 Minus#1843: remember that bonus points are also credited if you get natural 20 on tongue
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: rofl
 Phoenix Indie#9754: Bonus points
 9bitmax#3119: hello
 Minus#1843: hope you can, with amount of stuff that is missing it would be a miracle if our game is going to be in working order xD
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: what if you accidentally throw it in their mouth?
 Dat_WeirdPerson#3654: We’ve decided to make our game more story based since we’ve had multiple program issues. So we’re going pretty good actually, we just might make it.
 Phoenix Indie#9754: Chuck a die at their face to remind them what’s the priority at the moment
 Mike_7926#2285: also a good excuse to punch them awake
 clay#7015: bonus: if your teammate goes off to sleep or goes AWOL you can find and shake them
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: lol
 Minus#1843: So far I had to translate GDD from drunken polish into something readable and edit models, cause 3d artists kinda borked scaling, and I had to figure out what exactly is "2-3 - enemies attack, medium heal, 3 gates" that's all I had and I had to give working elements of game logic to create that :V
 Mike_7926#2285: my team is my brother. The problem with game jamming with siblings is that you ocassionally have the urge to murder eachother
 GM637 the LEGEND#4457: Demotivation...... ight people i guess ill pull out a 12 hour run
 vanilla#0006: man this jam is making me unbelievably stressed out 😭
 GM637 the LEGEND#4457: Oh god my worst nightmare...
 Dat_WeirdPerson#3654: Our team is a hard-working yet clueless game designer and me, a script writer who wants to help but doesn’t know anything about the program 😂
 Minus#1843: our game is either going to be finished and playable, or it is going to end as a huge mess with random parts  thrown everywhere, like supersonic gates that are not slowing down, cause I added waypoint as a child of gate.... yeah gate was constantly chasing it's destination :V
 Valkyrrii#3264: they do- I _hard_ failed the last one.
 Minus#1843: if it is launching itself and not causing immediate crashes and/or other weird things to happens then yeah! That should be enough 😄
 Phoenix Indie#9754: I hope they accept glorified prototypes, because this is also my first game jam
 Minus#1843: Our team is basically: Hopeless 3D Artists, Hopeless Game Designer, who cannot even stay up for 24 hours, and me, a Hopeless Programmer who has to somehow join together ideas and models thrown around and make it to complete game, I love game jams 🙃
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: Im in "playing Rain World" mood right now, but i wanna finish my game first lol
 KaineShadory#1612: first jammers lezgo!! 🙋
 Quinnster#8573: same, this is my first jam and I just started basically
 clay#7015: my first jam was last years GMTK I think? I had a centipede enemy that I got working after 6 hours. spent most of the jam on that dang centipede
 TwoWholeWorms#8078: Englandland.
 Mike_7926#2285: Random question, is GMTK based in britain or america
 KaineShadory#1612: I've left the jam but just gonna continue working on it hopefully at least get something out yaknow, better than sitting on my butt working on this big thing I have in mind
 Minus#1843: I made dice rolling work... as it is quite important part, but there's no levels, no triggers, no events, no enemies, cause everything I did was so far: "Alright I need to program this thing, then spend next 3 hours working with my code to create assets that would use this code, and then I can maybe create yet another script that will test these assets"
 adrenalyzed#5024: i can finally add my main mechanic to my game
 Arleycht#7791: i can attest to that
 clay#7015: the first jam is always rough, especially if you're going solo
 KaineShadory#1612: I haven't even started on the dice rolling part lul facing problems left and right as a new beginner haha
 b1n4ry#5112: its 6 am right now
 Minus#1843: for me it might be both tbh xD it is already quite bright outside, and I didnt sleep yet :>
 Ceding Tree#1081: Sleep tight!
 Minus#1843: I wouldn't say stressful but can be a little bit... interesting when everything you worked on starts to collapse because one stupid mistake is making everything fall apart :V
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: relatable
 b1n4ry#5112: im in sleeping mood, goodnight everyone, or maybe good morning i dunno
 Ceding Tree#1081: I know that feeling, I'm solo as well! Got something pretty decent working though. (at least decent by solo dev with 48 hours standards) lol
 FryDev#0372: crud, my mechanic isn't working
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: honestly im doing doing kinda fine doing this jam on my own
but yea solo jams are stressful as heck lol
 clay#7015: Awesome I’ll dm you so I don’t lose your discord :)
 Arleycht#7791: yeah sure, im currently still in the programming mood ^^
 clay#7015: lol rookie mistake, expecting other people to do things
 BadPiggy#5202: I mean, you're not wrong lol
Even worse is that you sometimes have no one to bounce ideas off of
 Wames#8409: dude solo jams are HARRRRRRD
 Minus#1843: meanwhile me: 3 person team, once again I am left alone to figure out everything...
My options: sleep for few hours to have fresher mind later, or crunch through this night and try to finish all stuff before rest of team is awake and we can work on other stuff '-'
 clay#7015: want to join our team after the jam is over? I'll have to ask the rest of my team (who are asleep right now) but we have a new idea I want to work on (I'm waiting for them to wake up to pitch it to them, idk if they're interested yet)
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: By assigning them to other people. Lol.
 clay#7015: woah, how'd you end up with so many responsibilities
 clay#7015: :o are you the only one on your team?
 fibοηezrα#0727: bosca ceoil is giving me amiga vibes and i love it
 clay#7015: everyone should make a team of stragglers, turns out they're awesome
 clay#7015: Haha we got really lucky with our team, I messaged a bunch of people in  and they almost all joined the team and hadn't even been messaged by anyone else, which really surprised me
 fibοηezrα#0727: that's clever, having people in different timezones! or even just taking breaks at different times
 nekotheasparagus#0809: I’m still mad at myself for being stuck with an infinite loop for a few hours
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: make sure you take breaks and get rest when needed
 Wames#8409: Scratch is mostly for art and some audio stuff, because for some reason my usaully applications aren't working.
 clay#7015: We’ve got people on both sides of the world, I got tagged in to finish the rough prototype tonight
Speaking of which I should get back to that
 Wames#8409: unity, VS code,  scratch, and Bosa Ceol, or how ever you spell it.
 Super#7038: Im not sleeping till my game is done.
 clay#7015: They’re all asleep right now so I won’t be able to ask until tomorrow.
We’re using Unity. We have a pixel artist, a musician, and two programmers 
 fibοηezrα#0727: sure! what tools are you guys using primarily?
 nekotheasparagus#0809: Ah, it’s more a cost benefit analysis of if I should keep the dice mascot essentially. The game never relied on dice, just the randomness to stick to the theme, the dice character was a sort of idea I came up with after hearing the theme and free attached to him, unsure if I benefit more by removing him or keeping him if that makes sense
 clay#7015: Ooh I like that idea! After the jam is over would you want to join our team? I’ll have to ask the other people if you’re interested :)
 fibοηezrα#0727: also it drains over time so you have to beat the boss quickly
 fibοηezrα#0727: that's a great idea, what if you had a luck bar that determines your crits and misses, which you need to max before going into the final boss fight. you can fight the final boss at any time, but if your luck is low it will be a slog
 clay#7015: I mean pretty much every past jam had a winner that didn’t explicitly adhere to the theme. I think as long as you’ve got randomness you’re good
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Bye
 nekotheasparagus#0809: I’m debating a mild change to my idea where I remove all the literal dice references but I’m not sure if it will ruin my chances of ranking at all if I remove them
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Hi
 clay#7015: ;-; at least it’s not just me. Hopefully my team wants to work on the new idea after the jam is over, they’re awesome
The new idea is all about spending luck like it’s a currency. It would be a deckbuilder roguelike where every card involves rolling dice. When you get bad rolls, you gain “luck”  and when you get bad rolls you lose luck. You can spend luck to use special abilities like “lucky dodge” (guaranteed your opponent’s next attack misses). You can also spend luck at shops to buy items. Also at shops, you can play a gambling minigame to affect your luck stat. If you’ve got bad luck, you can gamble away money to get rid of it
 Unclouded#9240: i had to start a new game
 Mukhavertolet#2243: ok i'm going to sleep. see you all 👋
 wyrm_slayr#7477: I have figurative dice for sfx recording
 Arleycht#7791: being dice that are trying not to fall off the edge of a table sounds like a great party game to me right now...
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: what are you using for the sfx?
 williamdoro#8857: i have literal dice for sfx recording
 fibοηezrα#0727: what's your new idea?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: if you are asking that then the answer is almost definitely yes 
 Scolon#4218: But yeah this has been really fun so far, can't wait to see what you guys have made
 clay#7015: Anyone else ever come up with an idea halfway through the jam that they wish they thought of at the start?
 Wames#8409: yeah pretty much same here
 DerpiestDude#2247: it's like 10:30 pm for me I will be up much longer
 fibοηezrα#0727: being force to do something is different from being driven to do something 😛
 Lawn#1538: Sleep is glorious.
 Lawn#1538: Last slog to the finish line! Woo
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Please don't make jokes etc about missing sleep/food/ etc for the jam. game crunch is a real problem in the games inductry and we don't want to encourage that
 fibοηezrα#0727: grinddd
 Mukhavertolet#2243: I have to make enemy ai and then just polish until it looks good
 Wames#8409: yep burning the midnight fuel
 DerpiestDude#2247: I think my game has potential (if I can finish)
 Scolon#4218: I have a ton of stuff in "Nice to Have" category though, I'm probably only going to be able to do a few them
Realistically speaking I have about 7-ish hours of dev left
 Wames#8409:  yeah my idea changed like half way through
 Scolon#4218: As for me, I have 7 things left on my trello board
 Wames#8409: I'm hoping to finish on time, but i don't know how well it'll fit the theme.
 Ceding Tree#1081: I love that I made an idea board for the first 2 hours of the gamejam, and have barely looked at as I've worked and ended up with a different "cooler" concept
 Wames#8409: nice
 b1n4ry#5112: ok thanks
 Z2D#3320: also figured out my favorite part of gamedev is the coding part
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Yes you are allowed to use the GMTK jam logo that is given freely on the itch page. You can't use Mark's face or pfp etc
 Ceding Tree#1081: There was something about that on the gamejam page
 Indigu#6862: Yes, read the FAQ on the itch.io page
 Z2D#3320: i wont be able to finish in time, but i will finish the game
 b1n4ry#5112: trying to figure out am i allowed to use GMTK logo, do i have legal rights to use it
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: they did
 williamdoro#8857: i woke up
 Leon the Artist#6349: Okay thank you
 Ceding Tree#1081: Even Hollow Knights game jam version was quite simple. Definitely something interesting to look into if you like that sorta stuff
 Scolon#4218: So how are you guys doing
 Indigu#6862: I think something that helps with the idea process is that it doesn't need to be perfect. You're probably not making a hit title that's going to match the likes of hollow knight and Celeste, and most of the time your goal is to just learn and gain new skills, not win the game jam. Go with whatever idea that works and can be executed in the time you have left, and there's less than a day left so your scope's got to be pretty small
 Ceding Tree#1081: Its not really my theme, I'm doing a turn based battler where players roll dice into an arena in the middle. I am trying to grab another video here after I get the shop mechanic finished!
 Leon the Artist#6349: I have that on my idea Pad! Lol.
 Veqsa#8120: Everything is going great this jam,
i never actually succeeded to stay calm while jamming
 Leon the Artist#6349: I am at a point of, will it be fun. I have a couple of ideas I could do still but they don't seem fun
 Indigu#6862: I commend you for your creativity
 b1n4ry#5112: guys genuine question, am i allowed to use GMTK logo in my game
 Ceding Tree#1081: No, my secret theme is revealed! 🤣
 Mukhavertolet#2243: someone did
 Indigu#6862: I'm surprised no one made a game about dicing vegetables yet
 Ceding Tree#1081: The best things in life are hard! But if its feeling like too much, ease up on yourself a little and check your scope. Are the things you are trying to do reasonable for the amount of time you have to work on them?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: you can interpret the theme how you want, it doesn't have to include dice
 Leon the Artist#6349: I'm still at the drawing board. Why is this so hard
 Kaybug#2122: We forgot about the dice part but hey that's okay 😅
 Ceding Tree#1081: lol, ok you win 🤣
 DerpiestDude#2247: there's a little less than a third of the jam left .-.
 Thombis Falafel#5224: in pico 8, its all in lowercase, and uppercase is represented with emojis. Its got a weird learning curve to say the least 😂
 Cyanberry#3882: eh, also thought it may have been malbolge
 Kaybug#2122: Just added a highly dynamic weather system based on real life weather forecasts and satellite pictures to our game 😎
 Veqsa#8120: Oh okay, yea cool i like them
 WorkingJoe#4433: Presumably mark just likes the Zelda games \:p
 Veqsa#8120: What is it with all the link emojis?
did i miss something 😅
 Thombis Falafel#5224: Ooooo close! Im storing my sprites as strings to save storage. Its just the binary of the sprite bitmap, turned into denary, than it grabs the character for that number in ascii code
 Cyanberry#3882: does it use base 3
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: yea i know, i was joking lol
 Thombis Falafel#5224: Pico 8 superset of lua
 Cyanberry#3882: brainf### uses only +-[]| : if i remember correctly lol
 Thombis Falafel#5224: 😂
 Mukhavertolet#2243: uuhhhh
 Cyanberry#3882: what programming language is that
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: what is that, brainfreck?

 Soup#3034: my code is clean, a little too clean...
 FryDev#0372: whoops wrong channel
 Ceding Tree#1081: I dont care so much, but its getting hard to navigate around and find where I should be changing things lol
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: yea i dont really care that much if my code is sloppy or ugle either. I just care if it works at the slightest lol
 Ceding Tree#1081: Man, my code is looking ugly at this point. But hey, it works so....... 😛
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: if in double choose roguelite
 Thombis Falafel#5224: I LOVE roguelikes!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Im pretty sure if it doesn't have meta-progression then its a  rogue lite
 Crusher48#2092: Question: what definitions does itch.io use for "roguelike" and "roguelite", which tag should I use for my game? It doesn't have any meta-progression at the moment
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Do Not make jokes like this. Crunch is a huge issue in the games industry and we will not encourage that
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: you don't have to be made an admin if the help was just a small thing you can just put a link to their page in the description
 Veqsa#8120:  i love the head bobbin,
_dont know if i said that right_
looks sick!
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: absolutely if you worked on the game you should be credited
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: also Unitys CEO, John Ricitello or something said in an interview that devs who dont think about monetisation early on in development are "[freaking] idiots" 😐
 GameDude#3494: Yeah, they are pretty much half of the indie games market at this point. Unless they add some disastrous features or refuse to fix some insane bugs/glitches, it will stick around for a while unless other engines significantly outpace it in terms of updates and better features.
 Thombis Falafel#5224: np 😁 , ping me if u post ur art! im a bit nosy so i wna see 😅 😂
 Ceding Tree#1081: What buisness practices dont you like? I use Unity and think it's pretty fair that they don't charge you anything unless you make more than $100K. I think if you make more than that with a game you made using their free product, you should contribute something to them yaknow?
 Valkyrrii#3264: thanks thombis - might throw some pixel art around once I've finished then. :D
 GameDude#3494: I'm not a big fan of sleeping. This jam should hopefully not be that much of an issue.
 Phoenix Indie#9754: not yet, but it’s gonna hit me like a semi in a couple of hours
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: yea same
 Lukey#6052: I don't really like Unity's business practices but I've used the engine for too long and gotten too comfortable with it to switch I'm afraid.
 Thombis Falafel#5224: just checked. Ur able to be in multiple so dont worry
 Valkyrrii#3264: THIS this so much.
 b1n4ry#5112: i reeeally wanna sleep
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: Unity, but im sorta thinking about switching to Godot after they they merged with iron source
but ill most likely stay with unity
 defDrep#6794: ooh fun
 Phoenix Indie#9754: I use Unity, but I use its visual scripting feature because I can’t do regular line coding to save my life
 Ceding Tree#1081: man, anyone else feeling the time pressure? lol
 Omniclause#4760: Im on unity as well.  Godot seems cool but I would like to eventually get a job doing gamedev and unity seems like a more valuable engine to learn for that.
 Valkyrrii#3264: side note- are we allowed to be credited for multiple teams? planning to help with last minute pixel art but don't want to disqualify my own work.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: it helps if you tink about scenes as prefabs and nodes as components
 Thombis Falafel#5224: bro u gotta its so fun. It is a bit odd at first, but there is something very satisfying about cramming your code into restrictions, plus your game source code is only 40kb max!
 Wames#8409: it can be pretty wacky sometimes
 Lukey#6052: Yeah I've been using unity for so long that I opened godot once to try it and literally wasn't able to do anything. I thought they might be similar but apparently not.
 Wames#8409: yeah i use unity. it works great. until it decides to behave.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: That is untrue. You can rate games if you haven't submitted one you just have to to rate some randomly selected ones before you can choose what games you want to play and rate
 defDrep#6794: I need to try out pico 8 some day
 ShatteredReality#7834: Yum yum nodes
 Thombis Falafel#5224: 😂
 Valkyrrii#3264: I just heard "node system" and perked up. _Very_ interested now.
 Thombis Falafel#5224: im using pico 8, its interesting 😂 . ive always wanted to try unity, but it looks too complicated. Godot also looks good, but that node system gives a shiver down my spine
 FryDev#0372: no, Godot is completely free
 defDrep#6794: Game Maker Studio
 ShatteredReality#7834: 🤣
 Soup#3034: godot is paid?
 FryDev#0372: my favorite paid opensource engine
 Snage#1337: ^^^^^THIS
 ShatteredReality#7834: Unidot
 Valkyrrii#3264: Unity but I'm seriously considering Godot for the future.
 Snage#1337: ^
 Soup#3034: unity
 FryDev#0372: Godot
 Thombis Falafel#5224: I'm just procrastinating rn 😅 , out of interest what game engines are you guys using?
 BlahBlahBlue#4023: Yeah lol
 FryDev#0372: do you mean comment on games? because you can’t rate games unless you submit
 Valkyrrii#3264: I already did :p
 BlahBlahBlue#4023: I might have to leave this jam I don't have enough time to complete my game because this weekend was quite busy for me. I hope all of you have good luck with your games and I'll be rating them!
 AlolanRaichu#2768: lmao me and my friend just named it dicemazing
 Pooooooooopppp#0524: simple idea just publish a game where you roll one die and thats it 👍
 FryDev#0372: I think I’ll need to incorporate “snake eyes” into my name
 .everyone#7591: ???
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Also remember when you upload your game to itch you must also link it to the game jam specifically
Cheat sheet about launching a game on itch but also super importantly the last step of adding the game to the game jam
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: the name i came up with for my game was Janitor's Roll
 defDrep#6794: slice n dice
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: remember to take breaks
 AlolanRaichu#2768: 🤣
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: *insert clever play on the words "dice" and "maze" here*
 Ber#3410: nvm itch already has a tag for gmtk lol
 GameDude#3494: This jam is breaking me down, literally. Lol. Just 12 more hours to grind through before the game is finished.
 AlolanRaichu#2768: what can i name my dice mazze game????
 Ber#3410: is there a tag for gmtk i put on my games tags?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: There's a reason we suggest uploading early and testing the builds on itch so that this sort of issue is avoided.
But many people post a post-jam version that fixes up some bugs etc  a few weeks after the jam, its super common
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Nope. You won't be able to add new files until the ratings are finished. Once the ratings are over you can do what you want with the page. the files, everything
 Minus#1843: Then, one question, if we find a quite big bug, fixed it, and we want to upload new fixed version... if we keep original version submitted and **clearly** state that that this other version is not for rating we can do that?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: You can change the page look and the written information at any time, you just can't change the files thats all
 xono#1000: ok thanks, just wondering to be sure
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yes, just not the files
 xono#1000: so i know you get 2 hours after deadline to upload you game, but can you update the art on the itch page past?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I wans't talking to you, I know you are
 Ber#3410: what
 poryphyr#2009: not saying anyone is, just looking for help if anyones got it
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: give it a rest, leave Ber alone
 Minus#1843: May I suggest to you to go to.... 😂
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yeah it is, but no one is obligated to help
 Ber#3410: dude stop ik what to do to god
 Minus#1843: I sometimes scan what is going on in help, but since we're quite close to the deadline here I am shifting my focus to actually finishing a game :>
 Ber#3410: it is true tho people dont always chat in them
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: that doesn't change the fact that this isn't the place for it. many people are active in tech help
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: nice
 Minus#1843: Yeah that's also same as "I'm not sure I need cat6a cable", then you don't need it, you'll know when you need cat6a xD
 poryphyr#2009: look i know its not orthodoxed but no one ever responds tp the ones in the other chat ok
 Ber#3410: yes ik what to do with turbowarp
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824:  
 Minus#1843: anyway time to use some black magic, also known as matrix and vector math to make my game work properly 😂
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I mean if you're gonna start a post with "I shouldn't ask this here..."
 Ber#3410: im putting DiceOut on itch rn it isnt done yet (obviously) but it works.. i think..?
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: Speaking of, are you making your game in scatch?
 Ber#3410: they're both website names 😭
 Veqsa#8120: No mine are worse 💀
some of them don't even have any sense,
`slot12132` 
`slot3434` 
and this 5 different times 😅
 Ber#3410: I KEEP SAYING SCRATCH INSTEAD OF ITCH WHY
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Cheat sheet about launching a game on itch but also super importantly the last step of adding the game to the game jam
 Ber#3410: i meant how do i add a game to itch
 Minus#1843: I think this is the options you are looking for 🙂
 The_Charmeleon#5954: turbowarp compiler
 Murten#0001: Who needs an array when you can:
```cs
public StickerSlot Top;
public StickerSlot Bottom;
public StickerSlot Left;
public StickerSlot Right;
public StickerSlot Front;
public StickerSlot Back;
```
 Ber#3410: how do i add a turbowarp game to itch
 Minus#1843: That's other settings - go to Project Settings -> Player -> Choose WebGL (you have to have WebGL module installed!) and under Resolution and Presentation there is an option to change look of player 🙂
 Omniclause#4760: Nice those look clean.  Unfortunately my game is pixel art style but I look forward to seeing these in some other games.  I like the pixel one from itch I just noticed it was literally the only one so I'm assuming it's gonna be used a lot.  Not that I have a problem with that but was just curious.
 belzimbub#1594: Good morning! I hope you are not loosing your souls)
 sendhelpidfk#6700: finally have the entire build system complete, i might be able to actually pull this off
 redseiko#0001: Ahhh didn't I post some messages earlier about variable names ahaha. This is why.
Yeap 4 hours ago.
 krisis in a jar#0904: i've no idea how i'm still awake, i've been awake the whole time of the jam
 Omniclause#4760: ohh dang I didn't even think to look there I am gonna check it out.
 Minus#1843: you can change design of it, but iirc cannot remove it entirely
 Murten#0001: kenny.nl has a pack with dice and playing cards.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I don't think its something unit does by default but maybe double check
 katiepotatoes#1609: yeah, i checked that, and it was unchecked and it’s still there :/ i’ll check the options again
 piguman3#4088: Hey what engine are you using?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I think if you take out the "include button for fullscreen" option. Its in the Embed details options somewhere
 Lukey#6052: well it's safe to say my game is pretty good. Just got my little sister to playtest it and she said it was 'very pog'
 coconut_orange#3725: Thank you!
 katiepotatoes#1609: anyone know how to get rid of the unity webgl banner at the bottom of the game? i resized the game window to hide it, but is there a way to remove it entirely?
 SpruceStudios#3210: Just hop over to the jam's page and hit submit project. Then just click your one when it pops up 🙂
 Veqsa#8120: OOH it feels so good that it finally works!
 FryDev#0372: oh there’s no time left
 Hero Tales#4824: thx
 coconut_orange#3725: How does submitting work? I have an itch page, signed up for the jam there. Is that all there is to it?
 Murten#0001: 
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: oh okay
thanks
 piguman3#4088: Hey how many people is using pico 8
 SaadTheGlad#9716: Our music/sfx guy baled on us though so that's a thing
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yeah sorry
 SaadTheGlad#9716: Fantastic, we're also putting everything together but taking a break to sleep now, hopefully we get it done by tomorrow
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: ohh its only for patrons?
 Murten#0001: You don't. The mods think that allowing people to add reactions will result in anarchy.
 Hero Tales#4824: does anyone know where I can ask for some help or advice for Unity C#? One of those moments where I know C# unity must have this kind of code, but I don't know what it is
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: pay Mark
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: how do i add reactions to messages here
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: We're putting all of the mechanics together as we speak! Just got the last of it done. Just checking to see how well they all talk to eachother! Hbu?
 Veqsa#8120: Why did i even call my variables
`slots1`
`slots2`
`slots3`
`slots4`
`slots5`
💀
 SaadTheGlad#9716: What's up Shadow! Progress going strong?
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: **ouch**
 coconut_orange#3725: That is literally what we're doing
 SaadTheGlad#9716: Who uttered dnd
 Veqsa#8120: **I fucking hate myself**,
i have been debugging for 2 hours straight now...
just to find out i used the wrong variable
😮‍💨 i was at the point of just giving up and quitting the jam...
 Klemp#9694: does anyone know have any dice roll sound effects?
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: top 10 anime betrayals (but i do fell kinda bad lol)
 redseiko#0001: *rip* I guess... the dice didn't roll in your favor. *badumtish*
 coconut_orange#3725: You have 16 hours left!
 Soup#3034: the jam ends tomorrow
 MrRoboman#9804: Better get started Shadow 😉
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 Soup#3034: the theme is roll the dice
 Soup#3034: this is day 2 of the jam
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: ***What?!***
 dullboomhoom#0378: it already did
 dullboomhoom#0378: I'm not making it though so if anyone can't think of an idea, DM me
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: there's also resources pinned here and in the sound help, plus you can ask in 
 MrRoboman#9804: Just spent the last 32 hours prototyping and making art. Now to get down to coding... what could go wrong 😅
 Soup#3034: sfxr sfx arent perfect, but theyre better than nothing
 dullboomhoom#0378: that theme! it fits my Idea!
 Sapient#3138: Use some free audio , some sources are given on the jam page
 Soup#3034: use sfxr
 NalaFala38290#9305: add a sound effect
 Klemp#9694: I need some audio
 Soup#3034: does your game have audio? audio instantly makes games more fun
 Klemp#9694: I swear the only real problem I have are the constant crashings and the game actually being fun
 Soup#3034: haha yeah
 Unclouded#9240: whats that
 bagel03#7025: weirdest thing, I was gonna do the jam, then after the theme came out, I thought of a game that I already know is way to big and has absolutely nothing to do with the them, but I want to make it right instead of on a grind
 Unclouded#9240: i use fusion
but my fusion wont work because its the free version
 SeanSS#0892: Cyberpunk on PS4 be like:
 Mukhavertolet#2243: PowerPoint >>> any engine
 BirdLogic#0828: I made a Scratch to Pygame converter
 NobodyCreator#9803: Scratch >>> unity
 Snage#1337: anyone feel like they lost time because they simply hadnt watched a tutorial before? and now has spent a bunch of time on tutorials?
 Unclouded#9240: does anyone here know scratch
 BirdLogic#0828: I'm going to try to submit something even if it isn't done yet.
 FryDev#0372: I want to make a lasso mechanic, which means I have to have a beam shooting out from the player to a hoop shaped rope and a bunch of little technical things that are just aaa
 BBB#7952: lol me neither but imma try
 Freaky Aguilar#4641: welp, I've lost complete faith. it was a good attempt but i'm not smart enough to finish my concept
 BirdLogic#0828: I just used Kenney.nl graphics and they actually look good but I'm still trying to figure out the game part.
 Wames#8409: And i've spend an embarrassing amount of times on Brackeys
 Wames#8409: yeah my art is absolute garbage, but the game is decent
 Capybara#8868: yikes, what happened with the mechanic
 froeg#0757: im having the opposite problem lol
 BBB#7952: i put way too much effor into the art and now i have to figure out how to do the game part
 Mukhavertolet#2243: 🙂
 SeanSS#0892: Its about the friends we made along the way
 FryDev#0372: welp, I’ve just dug myself into a hole by making my game depend on a complex mechanic that is difficult to make
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: people generally play them long enough to get the idea then they give feedback
 Mukhavertolet#2243: well gamejams are not about winning so that doesn't matter that much. At least i'm happy
 Veqsa#8120: 
yes i know that,
thats the problem 💀
U have to get as close to the correct answer
but u have to choose wisely
 Yru2kind#0605: I try and play em for longer, but if it doesnt stick or not intutitive then im on to the next
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: there are people who play for longer and games that get played for longer but generally people move through them quick
 Mukhavertolet#2243: my game is probably a bit too complex for 3 minutes. sad
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I'm not saying this to put anyone off but generally when playing and rating people will play your game for less than 3 minutes. A taster is what you are going for
 redve#6507: But then i won't make it challenging ;_;
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: so put the game on itch and don't touch it again then
 Yru2kind#0605: You all got this guys
 Lukey#6052: phew im back time to finish my entire game
 SeanSS#0892: There's always a place for them and that place is *everywhere*
 redve#6507: Well, i cannot in next 17 hours.
And my code is so shitty, i won't want touch it ever again XD
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: 16:9 is what aspect most people's screens are. I usually go with 1280 x 720
 redve#6507: I have no place for them
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I wouldn't worry about that, you're just showing off the mechanic as a tatster so if its done and the mechanic is playable then get it built and get it on itch, you can tweak it after
 ado#6044: what's the recommended resolution for itch.io webgl game?
 SeanSS#0892: Simple really, add spikes, lots of them
 redve#6507: I don't think i have enough time to add enemies, as i don't know how to actually add them ;_;
 redve#6507: Ugh, i created a game. It has some mechanics, some graphics, sounds etc.
But i have no idea how to make it challenging
 SeanSS#0892: Unless its something that litterally makes you unable to test the game, I suggest moving on for now and come back to it later lol
 ShaggyMuffin23#0326: i've spent the last hour and a half trying to figure out a collision glitch
i feel like i'm losing my mind
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: you only have to link it once so once its done it's done even if you update the files so its worth doing early just to cross it off the list  of tasks
 SeanSS#0892: Yea
 wumpus#3512: ~~top of where? the game page?~~ found it! yep its submitted
 SeanSS#0892: There should be a thing at the top that says it got submitted
 wumpus#3512: im 99% sure i did, how do i check?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Remember everyone uploading the game it itch is not enough, you **MUST** link your game on itch GMTK jam page for it to count as a submission to the jam
Cheat sheet about launching a game on itch but also super importantly the last step of adding the game to the game jam
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I mean its hard to accidentally upload it but yes you can, although I would advise you to leave it up and just replace the files when you have a more current build to put up
 hehe boi#3720: Thank you so much! :)
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yeah its your game you can do what you want with it, the restrictions are only in plave until the jam ends then its yours to do what you want with
 hehe boi#3720: Hey! Could I publish my game to another website aswell as the itch.io jam thingy
 CookiesRiot#2732: the game uploads will be digitally locked so you won't be allowed to change the files or add new ones. the text and stuff works.
 SeanSS#0892: Ah icic
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: uploading new files won't work, itch just won't allow it
 Phallo#3476: thank you for answering that... i was just wondering if you would be allowed to edit the itch page after the submission time!
 CookiesRiot#2732: doesn't work for me. i live far enough north that "day" is about 19 hours this time of year.
 SeanSS#0892: How are you able to check if they only changed the text or not?
 krisis in a jar#0904: if i accidentally upload my submission, can i delete it?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: you can upload new versions of the game until the jam ends, after this you can't change the files until the voting ends although you will be able to edit the look and the text of the page at any time
 Jhunter#4054: Yeah I had to cut so much and get the minimum viable product but it’s gonna be so much better because of that
 SeanSS#0892: 1 day and 2 fourthknights
 Phallo#3476: I just did my first test build... my unity webgl build is currently 17mb
 CookiesRiot#2732: correct. no edits to the game.
you can report the time in GMT/UDT/Zulu/whatever the kids are calling it these days
 E0115F 101#2073: I was gonna say the time but then I realised timezones exist
 krisis in a jar#0904: so i can't upload new builds of the game to the itch page, right? (oh ok)
 akaBl4ck#7384: i managed to finish all my mechanics for my game! (by like cutting the scope by half!)
i just have to make 5 more levels because yes
 CookiesRiot#2732: Yeah you can change anything about the itch.io page except the actual uploaded game files once submissions are due
[no more file uploads]
 SeanSS#0892: Specifically a couple hours of tommorrow
 krisis in a jar#0904: can i edit the game page after uploading, can i also add new files?
 E0115F 101#2073: Tomorrow
 Omniclause#4760: There's still a good bit of time! Cut some of the scope and features and I bet you can finish something.  If I remember correctly you can edit and update the visuals of your actual page after the jam is over.
 arcade#9284: When does the jam end
 Murten#0001: Probably just a framework.
 Professor Pickles#8498: wtf what engine are you using
 Shadow the Dragon#6927: Doing final gameplay tweaks before moving onto art, sound, levels, play-testing, and minor things. Yay.
 swarm#1128: What's your executable size? Mine is 60 MB 😶
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: remember to link the game to the jam don't just make a page for it
 Brando#7162: I keep entering jams and never finishing, pretty sure I'm not going to finish this one, but this may be the first time I finish the game after the Jam.
 fiendfire#3466: Hargensnargle
 Jhunter#4054: Thanks for the tip
 Murten#0001: Yet we have to wait half a minute to send a message.
 wumpus#3512: yeah, everybody is like halfway through dev and not talking lmao
 Murten#0001: Slow mode seems a bit excessive for the activity rn.
 Niilyx#5895: just try Sonic CD's OST
 Murten#0001: I'll just have someone on my team do that.
 wumpus#3512: anyways to the point, everybody should make one - even if you know you wont finish
 Murten#0001: This song while writing code at 2:00AM = 👌
 GuyWithTime#7852: uhhh its 2am I think im gonna head to bed
Goodnight everyone! 👋
 Luna | Wuffli [she/her]#0001: im very happy and calm rn
 Luna | Wuffli [she/her]#0001: Imagine i have a working alpha but i cant build it :)
 ZedDev#4726: I can hardcode stuff as much as I want knowing nobody other than me will have to deal with it
 BirdLogic#0828: When you realize your spaghetti code is at a point where you can't continue without a refactor.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: woo get it up on itch link it and then you can relax knowing its up and done
 ZedDev#4726: So I'll actually complete my first jam
 ZedDev#4726: So if it works now, i can go rest. I'll only have the leveling system to add until it's done
 Scolon#4218: Oh yeah I do need to do the title screen and stuff too
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: rip
 ZedDev#4726: I was wondering why the heck my enemies weren't getting deleted when they had 0 health for 10 minutes but it was just me that called the wrong function
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: good choice
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: The public channels get closed a few days after Mark's video goes out. You'll still be part of the server but you won't be able to see or interact with any channels, its patrons only
 krisis in a jar#0904: now i'm just going to change the font, build it to windows and make the itch page
 Dances with Runebears#6674: Does this server get dissolved at the end of every jam?
 krisis in a jar#0904: i finally finished my game!
 ZedDev#4726: Tbh the only pretty lookibg thing in my game is the menu
 ZedDev#4726: I completely scrapped rooms cause i would have had to make sprites for the tiles and stuff, so now its a roguelike wave based top down shooter
 Scolon#4218: I have to add a lot of rooms for my roguelike, but that's the easy part and will only take about an hour or so
 ZedDev#4726: My player is just a white square
 syelan34#3258: but those take like 10 minutes, mostly the art is the problem because right now my player is a flat square with a number instead of a die
 ZedDev#4726: I'm gonna go sleep (or at least lurk on youtube) after i make sure my AI doesn't break with one last test cause its currently 11 PM
 Pixel#9717: r u looking for a co.?
 syelan34#3258: plus i have like 2-4 more levels to make
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: thats great, get it up on itch before you start the polish then you have a safety net
 syelan34#3258: I still have like 90% of my art to do, at least it's mostly small tile textures
 .everyone#7591: Anyone have recommendations for where to find a more long term group of developers?
 JuliusCube#8501: aight i think im done with everything in my game except the menu and (maybe) a bit extra polishing
but thatll be for tomorrow since its 1:30 am for me
im going to sleep
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Its a jam game, people expect there to be missing stuff, everyone knows to look in the description for the controls and for known issues
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yeah thats fine
 FryDev#0372: eh, a lot of people might not read the description because they’re in a rush to play games
 NalaFala38290#9305: is it ok to put the how to play in the description instead of in the game
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yeah possibly, I can suggest it for next year. They are much harder to moderate though so it probably won't happen this year but I'll mention it in the mod rooms
 ryan123#4605: lmao the dice in my game was too hard to program for me so i just removed it and made a bloxorz spinoff
 Luna | Wuffli [she/her]#0001: It would make the help channels a bit better, i think, if it would be possible to create threads ^^
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: no because sometimes people were playing games early and then not bothering to replay them and actually rate them, or were going back and rating them based on the earlier version not the final upload etc so now its all hidden
 Scolon#4218: Oh you can't see early submissions anymore? nice
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: when the jam is finished there will be a tab with all the games and yo'll be able to search them and sort through them
 Mukhavertolet#2243: roll of the cat
 AsleepInSpace#4793: Alright i figured but i though asking is better then just assuming!
 FryDev#0372: in some jams you have to wait to view the submissions until the end of the submission period
 AsleepInSpace#4793: How can i checkout the games once the jam is over. Im confused because i dont see any place for the gm2k games. (Im new to itch.io)
 FryDev#0372: is the table okay
 Minus#1843: Did that cat want to become dice itself 🤔
 Mukhavertolet#2243: my cat just fell of the table
 Veqsa#8120: Me too! For the first time,
even tho other jams i tried i had way more time haha
 kablouser#4232: Please end my suffering!
 Unclouded#9240: does anyone use scratch /s
 Beeg scarf#3571: im gonna make it
 Minus#1843: My game turned into forest of random rays used to debug stuff...
 Veqsa#8120: okay thanks!
Oh yea and i didnt think about the browser,
so thank u
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: Rules state you only need a Windows or browser build and 90% of people are playing on Windows so I wouldn't bother
 wren#0640: 20 hours left and just starting, bold tbh
 Scolon#4218: Yeah I think I'm gonna have to cut one thing
I'm gonna finish my game's polish and see how much time is left
 Beeg scarf#3571: i finally got a baller idea lets start baby lets go
 Veqsa#8120: ⚠️ help please :)
How do i test my game on Linux and Mac?
and should i even upload those
Dont want to create a virtual machine ect.
but, does it work if it works on windows?
never builded using those
 Sapient#3138: That's great
 Jellogramming#4653: all I need to do now is polish my game
 MikeHazeJr#6582: Probably about 25% done with the total plan. Not super complicated but I am building it with extension in mind so I don't need to refactor later.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: sadly teams falling apart is a risk you take during game jams. You might be able to find someone else or you might be able to work around it.
Get what you have so far uploaded and linked up then start to tackle the next problem
 MikeHazeJr#6582: Probably not going to get a full game-loop implemented in time for submission, but the foundation is built for a pretty great puzzle game
 Unclouded#9240: im going to sign up with GitHub
 Jellogramming#4653: you might be able to get someone to replace them in 
 Scolon#4218: Heard a lot of teams falling apart...
 SlingingPlant145#5532: It feels great when someone signs up for a certain team role and then vanishes during the jam. 🥲
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: you need an itch account to use itch
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Yes
 wyrm_slayr#7477: I tried just using a nice color palette with simple shapes, and it looks pretty good.
 Unclouded#9240: (wait, do you have to make a itch account to download games?)
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: So? If it thinks you did you could see what happens
 Unclouded#9240: i never made a account before
 Ahat#0842: i tried godot, and its working out ok
 Jellogramming#4653: having the camera scroll between rooms instead of instant transitions
 Mukhavertolet#2243: first 3d game. rotating objects is kinda hard for some reason
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: maybe it is try saying you forgot your password see what happens
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: Who here has attempted some new technique they wanted to try this game jam? How did it go?
 Ahat#0842: wish i did more work yesterday, but there is literally no time to dwell on the past
 Unclouded#9240: why does itch.io says my email is already taken?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: with 18 hours to I would fully recommend anyone who hasn't put their game up in itch yet get a version online and linked up to the jam. You can still update and change the files as much as you want up until the submission deadline
 Balrajjjjjj#8760: will do!
 1Am2Good4You#4414: Apologies if my message doesn't fit in here but it really is a question for overall game design not specific to a category
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Cheat sheet about launching a game on itch but also super importantly the last step of adding the game to the game jam
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I would try building it now and put it up, that way you can test it and you have time to get it working if something is wrong
 1Am2Good4You#4414: My game contains lots of minigames (all packaged in their own kind of object). For now I have everything finished except multiplayer (and a lack of other minigames). Do you guys think I should first work on getting multiplayer working and then focus on other minigames or the other way around?
 Ahat#0842: tommorow for me will be probably uploading, i wake up at the time the jam ends, before th e 2 hours for uploading starts
 SparkerXof#3127: I think I need to cut some ideas. Making even this primitive game was a bit hard for me, and I spent too much time for stuff like graphics.
 Balrajjjjjj#8760: ty!! that's reassuring
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: fantastic
 softmagic#9999: looks like Sunday will be polish and possible gameplay diversifiers
 softmagic#9999: alright, i'm almost finished with everything i wanted to put in the game
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Yeah pretty much you just need to choose webGL as your options, make sure you select you fill in the size you want the game etc and press export same as you would for web. Then you need to zip all the files together just the same
 Balrajjjjjj#8760: unity and no 😅 I've built to exe in Unity before, is it pretty much the same thing just with targeting web?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: what engine are you using have you got it exported?
 Ahat#0842: im doing it! its coming together now! need to make a couple more tiles, some characters, then some code and level is done!
 Scolon#4218: I think i have about 10-12-ish hours of development time left accounting for sleep and food breaks
I'm really close to being done, trying to finish everything today and have tomorrow morning be for wrapping things up, bugfixing and testing
 Balrajjjjjj#8760: would you know a decent resource for building for itch? I'm a bit nervous about that bit
 arcade#9284: When does it end
 GuyWithTime#7852: thats a good point might do that
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: How are people getting on, have you managed to put a version up online yet, its worth getting it uploaded and linked to the jam so that you have a version ready to do just in case
 Veqsa#8120: Oh sorry, ur about me and pfp
 Jellogramming#4653: 
 Mr.Boda#3589: how to make text appear out of the canvas in unity anyone help plz
 just_plenesar#1999: gn
 sbubby#4885: gn!
 iwonek101#1251: Gn everyone, need to get some sleep
 just_plenesar#1999: you can color this yellow man so easyly
 sbubby#4885: anyone fixing bugs rn? cause we are trying to
 Pydude#7379: not this line, mine is yellow
 Pydude#7379: okay, thx
 ChipmunkDev#1808: so do a
 Pydude#7379: b (the thin one)
 ChipmunkDev#1808: which one's uglier
 GuyWithTime#7852: Goodnight!
 FryDev#0372: I need to focus and get stuff done
 iwonek101#1251: same looks like a garbage but it's slowly becoming a game in case of functionality
 GuyWithTime#7852: Nice to know thanks!
 Cunnah#9270: Right good night guys, hopefully I will have something by the end of tomorrow 😄
 Pydude#7379: I have to choose: a) the line is ugly b) the line is very very thin
 Cxly#2812: every time i'm just like "huh. you can do that? if i knew that a week ago i would have saved 2 hours"
 kr0tyara#6639: 19 hours left and my game is still looks and works like garbage
 39#6748: yeah, its really easy to pick up and when you get used to it, you have so much more control over everything. also its really convenient that there is a way now to compile pygame to wasm
 just_plenesar#1999: i dont know any engine so im starting with unity
 Cxly#2812: ive got work all day tomorrow so i don't think my game willl be done but it's amazing regardless how much i learn about scripting every time i start a new project
 iwonek101#1251: half of my game is working i don't know how but i won't touch anything
 39#6748: 💪 🐍
 Niilyx#5895: unity was the only engine we knew, we kinda had to pick it
 GuyWithTime#7852: I also plan on learning it sometime soon since I've heard many good things about it
 Scolon#4218: check the itch page
 Pydude#7379: same for me
 JOJO#9627: When is the dead line ?
 39#6748: never really liked it, the only engines i really enjoyed were godot and gdevelop when i wasnt coding a long time ago, now im learning pygame with this jam and i fell in love with it lol
 just_plenesar#1999: same for you man
 iwonek101#1251: great, hope you finish soon
 Valkyrrii#3264: it's working but. anything else would be working in a fifth of the time.
 Niilyx#5895: HAH well, at least, you're sparing yourself, we're going Unity 3D crap
 just_plenesar#1999: finely dont with the tiles after a day of working the last few hours would be codeing even the first level
 Valkyrrii#3264: I need to remind myself next time I *think* about trying an accurate perspective top down game that the math is a _nightmare_.
 39#6748: haha, trust me, pygame it is
 GuyWithTime#7852: Prolly same
 Kapcpa#2087: * Slowly falling into never ending bug fixing nightmare because of game mechanic and spagetti code * 😂
 iwonek101#1251: Same, GN!
 SquidGeneral10#4090: amen to that lol
 just_plenesar#1999: yea code platformer ez pz but i do 6 levels at one
 Niilyx#5895: nah for me it was long as hell because of these stupid tposing humans refusing to raycast towards me
 Hederlunden#3231: Good night everyone, gonna wake up pretty early tomorrow, got a LOT to do
 FryDev#0372: puzzle games where you roll a dice around on a grid to get on a certain spot with a certain number seem pretty common
 iwonek101#1251: i think they are a bit easier in some things but puzzle games are sometimes more creative in my opinion
 Spartiality#1145: I’ve ever code it so…
 sendhelpidfk#6700: ok there's some minor bugs where you can build on top of yourself and imprison yourself because i haven't implemented removing things but _miiiiiiiinor detail_
 just_plenesar#1999: i do a platformer and its not easy
 iwonek101#1251: haha well i am not dutch but yeah
 39#6748: that means you can forget ur day tomorrow lol, literally today was so weird, it feels like i just got up and suddenly its night again
 Delphine Noel#1196: It's too late I think I should sleep I did say my scope is small
 just_plenesar#1999: i did just that but with the opisite
 Spartiality#1145: Ngl, platformer would be easier
 Veqsa#8120: A fellow dutchie among us
 Kapcpa#2087: Nice, keep pushing!
 Danny Dan Dan#6699: Hey! I've also been struggling immensely with a building mechanic lol
 Scolon#4218: Alright im on break now
 Delphine Noel#1196: Oh there will be tons of those
 iwonek101#1251: i just looked at my to do list and i was like: Wow i might actually do this it's about 50-60%
 sendhelpidfk#6700: i finally finished the building mechanic for my game
now to make the buildable structures actually do something aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
 Veqsa#8120: 😬 i wish u good luck
 Niilyx#5895: not really, i feel bad cos i really wanna finish it
 Spartiality#1145: Nope, some puzzle game
 Delphine Noel#1196: you're making a platformer?
 W4sD#5521: is there gamemaker html license available for this year?
 FryDev#0372: I don't have a core game loop done yet, but I have some art and animations done too, so probably 40% done
 Veqsa#8120: Same, somewhat around 75%… only things left is a score system and menus ect! So im good :)
 39#6748: lucky you
 Spartiality#1145: Literally me
 Danny Dan Dan#6699: I think I'm maybe around 60%? There's a few more mechanics I need to iron out and then it's stuff like graphics and levels
 Niilyx#5895: till now I've done """AI""" and we're about 65% done
 Delphine Noel#1196: I literally just started. but then again my scope is also very small
 Veqsa#8120: Top 100 will be almost impossible if it doesnt look finished…
 FryDev#0372: I just really hope my game is fun and good aaaaaaa
 just_plenesar#1999: nice gimick
 Niilyx#5895: haha and im in a team of 4, doing the less possible
 Kapcpa#2087: How much progress have ya all made already? I want to compare myself with others as i think i might have done around 65-75% (only easy and medium stuff left)!
 GuyWithTime#7852: No problem glad I could help
 JoeWantsABrew#4787: thankyou 🙏
 Niilyx#5895: fair
 FryDev#0372: if my game turns out to be fun, then I think I'll be good, even if I have to work into the night a bit
 nekotheasparagus#0809: To an extent, but you’ll have a better chance to get top 100 and a chance at being featured in the video if your game is more polished looking
 Delphine Noel#1196: it should  show in your dashboard?
 39#6748: until now i was struggling with algorithms which check if a tile fits into a grid (puzzle game) and that i finally did it i feel so good since i know the worst part is done
 GuyWithTime#7852: go to the itch.io page of your game and see if theres a little badge in the top right that says you submitted it to the gmtk 2022 gamejam
 JoeWantsABrew#4787: is there a way to see if my game has been submitted?
 Delphine Noel#1196: I'm seeing a new picture in  even though it's night time. That's right, keep it up boys
 nekotheasparagus#0809: A die that rolls itself to make something bad happen to the player
 FryDev#0372: from what I've seen, 90% of the games are probably going to feature literal dice
 Niilyx#5895: personally im struggling with animations
 BanananaMonke#3591: FRYDEV
 CFHM#9742: hundreds XD
 Danny Dan Dan#6699: Holy crap, I've found so many edge cases that break my game, I might just make it hard enough that most players won't get far enough to encounter them lmfao
 Delphine Noel#1196: I wonder if there will be any games which will literally be a rolling dice. Like a virtual dice
 Niilyx#5895: huh
 BanananaMonke#3591: Its so standard/ordinary and it doesn’t even have epic looks
 Delphine Noel#1196: people can say whatever they want but sub conscious mind will do its job
 Chazi b#4006: I've gotten to the point where I really should make some graphics and my inexperience shows 😦 I have no idea what look I want/can achieve
 BanananaMonke#3591: Just realized how bad my game is
 Niilyx#5895: do you think people are forgiving if the games LOOKS unfinished? (and prefer the gameplay/idea)
 KadDev#8100: ok, thanks for the advice!
 Delphine Noel#1196: I'm finally doing something boys
 Hederlunden#3231: YE- yesssss" I fixed the issue ive been stuck on for 5 hours. apparently, i had the wrong boolean hidden in my code which looks identical to another one for the other player in a 400+ long spaghetti code script. Now time for the other 70% of the cod- fuck
 KadDev#8100: oof, alright, i'll take that into consideration
 just_plenesar#1999: enemy idea?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Might be a good idea to check in on  and explain your issue there 🙂
 Niilyx#5895: damn it
 CFHM#9742: i only am able to give each game a few minutes. If I have to spend 3 of those minutes reading lore, I usually won't play more.... :/
Not to dump on cool lore, but without *something* to play, it's just a book and we're here for games.
 KadDev#8100: gives me even more hope lol
 Reptilian135#9436: unitys being anoying and giving me an error but i followed a full video totorial and they had no error what should i do
 8-Bit duck#4223: I do love a game with a great lore
 GuyWithTime#7852: Thats something
 KadDev#8100: even if I can't make a fun game, I will make a great lore...
 GuyWithTime#7852: Yeahhh that also happens
 FryDev#0372: the inventor of autosaving: Otto Savei
 CFHM#9742: It's the same for me except I come to this chat when I finish a feature then I forget to go back to start the next one
 GuyWithTime#7852: Thx for the reminder
 GuyWithTime#7852: I always stay in this chat when I'm having trouble coding something and while I chat I think of solutions and I gotta say that tactic has worked really well so far
 Zigordion#3748: i hope the person who invented autosaving is in a good place right now because it just saved me 2 hours of work...
remember to save people
 sendhelpidfk#6700: my game idea has underwent a lot of featurecreep in the name of interesting puzzles, this should be interesting
and by that i mean idk if i'll finish in time
 GuyWithTime#7852: Yeah I would say so
 Jasper#7906: Is the itch.io genre "card game" reasonable for a game that is a lot like a card game, but uses dice instead of cards?
 Zayed#7379: Same but very little
 RiverDog#8199: It is much  more difficult than i estimated*
 SandQuick#1920: Actually do you guys have some finished content? Me neither...
 Zayed#7379: no one said it was going to be ez
 GuyWithTime#7852: Its just nervous
 R2D2Vader#0693: watch me make the enemy in my game a big sweaty hand 👀
 FryDev#0372: especially sweaty hands
 GuyWithTime#7852: hehehe
 R2D2Vader#0693: i was thinking a coin before but a domino is good too....
 SandQuick#1920: a red one
 FryDev#0372: hands
 GuyWithTime#7852: Its trying to be a dice but its not quite there
 Freast#9278: a coin with 2 sides
 R2D2Vader#0693: oo
 GuyWithTime#7852: A domino piece
 Turquoise#2894: GMs
 R2D2Vader#0693: y'all real quick, what object the enemy of dice?
 SandQuick#1920: no
 Renard#3525: is there a hashtag for the jam on twitter?
 Danny Dan Dan#6699: Rotating complex shapes is more work than I thought lol
 Zayed#7379: yeah, its deep end programming
 Danny Dan Dan#6699: You know that moment when the more you try implementing your feature, the more complicated you realize it actually is, until you just give up and hope you've put in enough to make it functional and hope nobody hits your edge cases?
 Zayed#7379: thats sed
 JuliusCube#8501: no.
 Zayed#7379: A way to publicize my game, put a link to my game so I get more publicity
 CFHM#9742: restart scene :3
 GuyWithTime#7852: Im gonna start my work on it any second now..
 JuliusCube#8501: too much work to do either of those, ill just put a "thank you for playing" scene or something
 Zayed#7379: XD, literally everything I couldn't do
 Scolon#4218: finally starting work on my player sprite
 Zayed#7379: Definitely no
U will already give credits for everything in some desc for game jam
 Hederlunden#3231: boss fight / chase scene, always ends with credits, or maybe some big plot twist
 wumpus#3512: im making an endless type game, so for me its just a "try again"
 SandQuick#1920: Roll credits?
 FryDev#0372: a “you win” screen
 JuliusCube#8501: what are some good ways of ending a game jam game?
 Hederlunden#3231: *hollow knight community
 GuyWithTime#7852: A win for the clown cummunity
 wumpus#3512: i managed to find a way to fit clown music into my game, this is a win
 GuyWithTime#7852: can confirm
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Do what you gotta do 💪  just make sure you don't crash once the jam is over. Ain't no jam worth that
 sendhelpidfk#6700: i did wowie 3.0 by staying up until 2 am and i'll do it again ~~also more importantly i only work properly under absurd amounts of stress because of the whole 'no adhd meds' thing~~
 Z2D#3320: same here
 Herweins#2336: 21 hours left and my game is not looking like a game aaaaaah
 Vabenil#5485: Future me hates me as much as I hate past me
 sendhelpidfk#6700: entire thing of 5 hour energy extra strength
the consequences are a future me issue
 Ragh#5984: I just realized I have made 319 files already and I'm nor even near done
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: drink three cups of caffeine especially if you're under 16. give in to caffeine.
 Vabenil#5485: Careful with the caffeine it's not trust worthy
 qxt2019#6669: Tommorows gonna be so much work
 sendhelpidfk#6700: ok downing this much caffeine to substitute for a lack of adhd meds was a Not Great™️ idea i can no longer control my stimming
 MCCV#1542: good point
 1Am2Good4You#4414:  well if it is that complex, you might be better off using a tutorial to teach the player the info you put on the screen. Everything is about balancing
 Hobusu#5033: Think I saw someone doing that
 1Am2Good4You#4414: Or just get shot if you make use of the dice 😉
 MCCV#1542: yea but the concepts of my game a pretty complex and I just don't know how to make it intuitive
 sendhelpidfk#6700: for a jam yeah
 nuntio#3053: Do you guys think 5 levels is enough for a platformer?
 sendhelpidfk#6700: also wait a shoot to move rts game with friendly fire genuinely sounds interesting
 Hederlunden#3231: does anyone else really feel like giving up
 Mukhavertolet#2243: shoot to move rock paper scissors
 1Am2Good4You#4414:  well just strip down your game to the essentials. Do you NEED to pause? do you NEED to adjust volume from this part of the game? Do you NEED to be able to skip during dialogue? Those kind of questions help you narrow down the essential parts of UI you would need for the player. Of course your game might have specific stuff like health inventory etc but even those you can narrow down.
 Viola_Buddy#6763: That's actually normal chess. When you shoot someone, you get teleported over to where the bullet landed.
 Shimp#0064: 12 am for me, already going to sleep, i ain't here to show of, i graduated from school for a reason (to sleep before uni)
 sendhelpidfk#6700: shoot to move chess
 CodingLord#1012: I know most are joking but you guys should sleep and take care of yourself
 Shimp#0064: Thanks, its a win if i even finish an ok game, since it already looks terrible since i am no artist nor do i have one
 sendhelpidfk#6700: shoot to move: the rts god game
 Ell#3559: UNO with shoot to move
 MCCV#1542: I aminly have it with trying to make it intuitive
 Mukhavertolet#2243: turn based shoot to move
 gnarbro#1627: Best of luck!! I've spent a ton of time making as much random stuff as possible and now I just hope my levels won't be trash
 Hederlunden#3231: it's only when you actually do a game jam you realize how much you hate them
 Viatrix#3575: good luck to anyone who got things done. i'm dropping out of this year's jam because I wasn't feeling very well and slept through a decent portion of the time
 sendhelpidfk#6700: better idea: make the jam about shoehorning shoot to move into genres that should not have it whatsoever
 1Am2Good4You#4414:  depends on what you want to achieve, brackeys tutorials are simple enough
 Vabenil#5485: I'm pulling an all nighter today, sleep is for the weak (and the smart probably)
 MCCV#1542: I'm horrible at UI, I never know where to start 😦
 Shimp#0064: Also, haven't made settings ever yet(didn't make public games either) and im unsure if i should now, will take a lot of time, since i used audio source play one shot for sfx and appearently volume doesn't matter for it
 1Am2Good4You#4414: pfff 8 AM is when you really need to go sleep
 Vabenil#5485: Good night
 CodingLord#1012: Goodnight guys, Its 3 AM, see you all tomorrow
 gnarbro#1627: Thats where I'm at, have all of my tools but I still need to make levels and put on the finishing touches.
 1Am2Good4You#4414: Working with someone online is quite scary. Whilst I am writing all the code I am not even sure if there is gonna be art to make use of the code xD
 Vabenil#5485: I wish it was me
 The_Charmeleon#5954: i bet someones doing something like that
 Vabenil#5485: Why did I not come up with that idea yesterday 😂
 Shimp#0064: Btw, if i made all assets but didn't make levels/main menu yet, am i on pace still lol?
 The_Charmeleon#5954: wow i needed that idea at the start
 Vabenil#5485: Yeah, and the bullets wouldn't kill you they would just knock you back
 Zayed#7379: I actually gave up since I had to go on a vacation
This is the last thing I did
 Hobusu#5033: People would still make shoot to move even if that was the theme, lol
 The_Charmeleon#5954: wow theat could have been fun you have to doge arms swinging and things being set down changeing the shape of the area
 sendhelpidfk#6700: instead of recoil just make it about shooting the die to roll it, that way you can claim the shoot to move joke while still being tangentially related to the jam theme
 Vabenil#5485: Exactly
 Arleycht#7791: janky physics would add to both the fun and the theme lol
 Scolon#4218: Well... I'm getting close to completion but it looks like I won't be able to do any of my stretch goals, sad
 Mukhavertolet#2243: next years theme should be "Not shoot to move" i guess
 Vabenil#5485: That one sounds good, whoever went for "the don't roll out of the table" theme struck gold
 Hobusu#5033: It's totally fine if they did, to be clear! But at this point we've been getting shoot to move games for years now, haha
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: the first time i made shoot to move i genuinely thought it was clever… smh
 Shimp#0064: But what if it will fit the theme
 The_Charmeleon#5954: falling off a table and going missing forever
 sendhelpidfk#6700: just spam the draw box tool lol
 Vabenil#5485: I'm going public assets. No way I would be able to make my own art in 2 days and worst of all is I'm a perfectionist so I would spend the whole time just doing and redoing the art
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: mark really has incredible power, being able to summon thousands of games about dice out of the ether
 sendhelpidfk#6700: what about a deck of cards that's been stacked, or something from a zero-randomness game with perfect information like chess?
 Amelia-chan#4996: idk but I have heard about it
 Shimp#0064: Quick off topic question: did anyone make shoot to move lol?
 Ber#3410: who
 Viola_Buddy#6763: Other gaming implements could be the anti-dice, like playing cards or dominoes or chess pieces or, like, Minesweeper Mines or something, I don't know.
 Arleycht#7791: ahh that just gave me the idea of a game where you are a dice trying not to roll off a table
 sendhelpidfk#6700: probably the least random thing possible
 Ahat#0842: i have nothing
 Amelia-chan#4996: they have
 Michel#2879: yeah you won't be making a professional game in 48 hours.
 TwoWholeWorms#8078: Don't waste what you've already done, at least upload it to itch and make notes on what you've got done, how long it took, and what you could do differently next time to help offset the stress ^^
 BanananaMonke#3591: Yes hands i agree
 Vabenil#5485: I would say those are their greatest allies
 Michel#2879: you still have 22 hours tho
 Mukhavertolet#2243: hands
 Ahat#0842: or maybe ill use public assets
 BanananaMonke#3591: Players
 Vabenil#5485: Hmm, what is the natural enemy of dices?
 Ahat#0842: im leaving the jam, m too tired, stressed, and have no idea what im doing
 Michel#2879: perhabs something simple. What about small purple majical balls?
 sendhelpidfk#6700: named in honor of the vision processing code i wrote ~half a year ago where i solved the memory leak by just nulling out every local variable even though they should have only been instanced to the function itself so it shouldn't have been an issue aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
 nuntio#3053: game pieces would be fun
 The_Charmeleon#5954: ive seen somehing similar where it's " if i whould of had more time i whould have written a shorter letter"
 Lukey#6052: Personally I disagree, if I write out a variable quickly and it ends up five words, I shorten it. Even in a rush.
 Ber#3410: enimeis? what
 The_Charmeleon#5954: what should i have my games enimeis be? you play as a dice in a magic place
 Viola_Buddy#6763: There's that one quote from that one author "sorry for the long letter, but I didn't have the time to write a short letter." That's kind of how I feel with things like this. Don't think; you don't have time to think. Just start typing out whatever the variable is and if that happens to be five words long so be it.
 Lukey#6052: I think some people have
 Michel#2879: yeah an believe me it will get more attention than most actuall games
 sendhelpidfk#6700: it's just me implementing garbage collection for my particle emitter list because i do not trust myself to do it correctly otherwise
 Ber#3410: why has nobody made a joke gamejam game about dicing food since that is a term
 dusda#2996: My favorite (now obsolete) function is in System.Web.Security. ```FormsAuthentication.HashPasswordForStoringInConfigFile```
 The_Charmeleon#5954: no i mean like i name a variable the same thing as a function of soemthing dumb
 8-Bit duck#4223: thanks were actually doing that now
 redseiko#0001: ```
// here by dragons.
// idk why it works I wrote it at 3am idk
// just leave it it's fine
```
 Mukhavertolet#2243: i can forget what is rotationAngle in 10 minutes so no single letter names for me
 Viola_Buddy#6763: This is the kind of thing I'd do. I'm the exact opposite of Vabenil; I can't do single-letter variables. The more crunched for time I am the more the variable names become utter paragraphs describing in detail what it's doing.
 CALSYTHE#6648: Someone make a game that just says "No Dice"  when players click on anything that resembles a feature.
 Ber#3410: LOL
 sendhelpidfk#6700: i think my favorite function name i have in my jam game is `stop_yet_another_memory_leak_from_happening`
 Vabenil#5485: Disagree, based on the context you don't need that many words, also you can abbreviate obvious or repetitive stuff
 Amelia-chan#4996: no.
 redseiko#0001: `InternalFrameInternalFrameTitlePaneInternalFrameTitlePaneMaximizeButtonPainter`
 The_Charmeleon#5954: i spend to long nameing variables only to then get confused later becasue of bad variable nameing
 Lukey#6052: `public GameObject dice;`
`public Transform spawnPos;`
 CodingLord#1012: Its 2:34 AM, should I sleep?
 Jemmeh#7117: entire sentences 🤌
 Ber#3410: its annoying to code and have a mosquito bite
 Vabenil#5485: I will have to agree with you on that one
 wumpus#3512: Im very sorry guys, i too have boring variable names
 The_Charmeleon#5954: now im 50% done with the main mechanic
 Amelia-chan#4996: variables should be no longer than 3 words in my opinion
 Jemmeh#7117: 🤮
 redseiko#0001: IDK I can be boring and do this one:
```
public float onCollideAddRelativeForcePower = 300f;
public float onCollideAddUpwardsForcePower = 200f;
```
 BBB#7952: damni really overestimated my ebilities here
 Michel#2879: You can make a troll game. Since you have not much time
 Vabenil#5485: For a game jam you can just call variables a single letter like a, b, c. Pretty unmatinable for the long term but in 2 days I won't forget what each variable does
 Jemmeh#7117: telling our secret variable names
 BanananaMonke#3591: Same
 Ber#3410: i added dani in the milk bg random thing
 sendhelpidfk#6700: one of the nice things about keeping things closed source is that i never have to reveal how awful my conventions are
 redseiko#0001: Our stuff is called: `HittableThings` `WorldHurties` `JazzHands`, etc, whatever works.
 Viola_Buddy#6763: ~~I spent like 15 minutes looking up the correct romanization of dabbaaba for a variable name~~
 Lukey#6052: I'd say I usually give my variables good names.
 Amelia-chan#4996: if you can't decide pick a random key on your keyboard and press it
 8-Bit duck#4223: What does anyone think about starting a new project at this point our game is very broken?
 BanananaMonke#3591: I just call variables a and b lol
 Joe Mcdermott#9590: I spend way too long agonising over what to call variables.
 Michel#2879: I remember doing a chess game in java and i had variable names like
BlackPlayerSelectedPieceCordinatesX
 Lukey#6052: Game = Game
Game > Game
Game + Game = Game
 sendhelpidfk#6700: ***flawless***
 Danieru#9855: Not on my computer, it doesn't
 nuntio#3053: half mine are just called thingy
 The_Charmeleon#5954: you>gamplay>consept exicution>consept
 Vabenil#5485: Let's not start talking about naming conventions or things aren't going to be pretty
 sendhelpidfk#6700: i will name my variables by keysmashing and you can't stop me
 Lukey#6052: Game > Game * (0 / 0) - 3.141592653589
 Michel#2879: define Game before using it. Also it's good practice not to use capitals for variable names👀
 redseiko#0001: var Game = _ => TheGame?.YouJustLost();
Game = Game > Game ? Game : Game;
OK i'm gonna stop making sense now back to the C# unity.
 The_Charmeleon#5954: you>game
 Vabenil#5485: It does compile as false
 Amelia-chan#4996: real
 R4zorcl4w77#9100: damn, good on ya
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: ^ Game
 redseiko#0001: > Game > Game
Does not compile oh no.
 sendhelpidfk#6700: Game >
 Vabenil#5485: 24 hours without sleep won't kill me (don't take that as advice, it can seriously affect some people)
 Lukey#6052: Game > Game
 Michel#2879: Game > Health > Joe Biden
 redve#6507: Maybe my game looks like shit, but it also doesn't work well
 Amelia-chan#4996: Game > Health
 Michel#2879: but it isn't about jaming I was so actif to sleep
 The_Charmeleon#5954: yesterday i got nothing done cause i was to tired to work smarter
 Lukey#6052: Health > Game
 Amelia-chan#4996: awful game > no game
 Michel#2879: mental health? i've only slept for 2 hours in the last 36 hours
 Lukey#6052: no nsfw > nfsw
 The_Charmeleon#5954: phyisical+mental health>gameplay>other stuff
 MaryStrawberry#4672: lucky, you can drink in most countries and make wonderful things without knowing
 redseiko#0001: Energy levels lol. I need all of this jam's coding to be spaced out with a few meetings over the week.
 Vabenil#5485: But what does age have to do with it, less creativity?
 SandQuick#1920: I have to finish my game soon, See you in the next day.
 MaryStrawberry#4672: small good concept > large bad game
 Hederlunden#3231: i wish i didnt get stuck on that bug for so long, i still am. now i have so much to code, and i would die for some sleep, but i wouldnt not submit a gamejam game for sleep so yeah... fuck me
 redseiko#0001: idk, I'm 36 sooo code quality drops after a few hours ahaha.
 Lukey#6052: true
 Vabenil#5485: Nah, I'm pretty sure I'm on the older side for one of this
 JuliusCube#8501: okay guys we understand
good game > bad game
 Lukey#6052: staying well and drinking water, etc > everything else
 Michel#2879: bug free > fun gameplay > well represented > graphics quality
 JuliusCube#8501: i probably have just been in many game jams, I'm actually not that great in game dv and pacing.
 Vabenil#5485: I don't know what that means, am I too young(21)?
 Acu1000#5560: actually finishing the project > gameplay > quality > quantity
 Lukey#6052: quality gameplay > quality graphics
 SpeedWolfy#3389: +1
 MaryStrawberry#4672: how's it going gamersssssssssssssssssssssssss?
 The_Charmeleon#5954: guys guess what my main mechanic is now like 30% compleate ( got almost no progress yeasterday due to lack of sleep)
 Violent_Lava_Fish#0063: Nice! You are certainly better at pacing than I am..
 Michel#2879: gameplay > quality > quantity
 redseiko#0001: In hindsight, my teammate and I have learned that jams are for younger persons than us... D: D: D: I don't code this much per day for work lol.
 Lukey#6052: do remember: quality > quantity
 JuliusCube#8501: I think im done with all the levels that are in my game.
Im pretty sure the only things I still need to do are the boring/basic stuff like a menu, and an ending so that the game doesnt just end abruptly.
ive got a good amount of polish on my game right now so I don't think I need to really do more polishing.
 Michel#2879: it's ok guys. Don't stress yall. Gmtk games are always kinda badly-designed and it's understandable because of the time limitation
the idea and gameplay are much more important than quality
 Lukey#6052: Yeah yeah I'm bug hunting B)
 The_Charmeleon#5954: i sugest watching/rewatching mark browns video on puzzel design but yeah its still difficult
 Valkyrrii#3264: shhhhh it's not wasted it's. uh. hunting for bugs!
 Vabenil#5485: Yeah, that's why I don't touch level design, specially for puzzles
 Technically Insane#9013: I KNOW BRUH IVE BEEN STRUGGLING ALL DAY
 Lukey#6052: You know your game is good when you waste 20 minutes playing it
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: The issue is puzzle level design.... is hard
 The_Charmeleon#5954: i have a dice that moves
 Valkyrrii#3264: I have like... 25% of a game, but brightside the hardest part is over. we all believe in you!
 sendhelpidfk#6700: in dev hell
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: a bit messy but hopefully fine - controls are kind of cramped, you move with wasd, discard a dice roll with 1, 2, 3, enter a result with z, shoot with space, and strafe (like in touhou) with shift
 Vabenil#5485: You already have more than me
 Technically Insane#9013: if its a code issue, gimme a dm and i can try and help, im abt done with my game
 dangertimmy#8239: that sounds cool actually!
 Michel#2879: You can do it. I believe in you
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: Now that he's made a game
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: Do you think Mark will enter?
 Technically Insane#9013: ime too, with a stretch
 CodingLord#1012: I barely have a game, I am so frustrated
 Michel#2879: it's not about your luck it's about the computer taking a seed and dividing it by a number lmao
 Viola_Buddy#6763: Oh hey that describes my game too
 Technically Insane#9013: how are yalls games?
 nbnd#6973: 2D platformer where you can change your weapon after a cooldown, but the weapon is random
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: Mine is a puzzle game where your character is a dice, and rolls to move. If it's on a two it will move 2 squares, and then be on a6, 1, 3, 4 depending on how you moved it.
 dangertimmy#8239: so there's not much game to it hahaha
 dangertimmy#8239: basically you have to bridge a gap. you click to generate a new path piece, but it chooses randomly from 6 options (which have different entry/exit points if that makes sense). so you can subtly guide where it goes but that's it
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: You move different when the face is different
 Nagisa#0566: Die as fast as possible
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: Just out of curiosity, in the shortest description possible what's you game about?
 Jarmister#8896: who said roll of the dice means luck
 wren#0640: woo composer just dropped out so now im on my own
 Hederlunden#3231: i hate luck, dont haha
 dangertimmy#8239: ahh let's just combine our two games and it will zero out lol
 Spartiality#1145: It’s great
 Michel#2879: I think that's the point of the theme
 kcorb#6614: Wonder how many are still actively participating, probably like 2.5k ?
 dangertimmy#8239: so I just realized my game is almost entirely luck based, and that this probably isn't a good thing. I think I need to make some design updates :0
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: I heard this somewhere. "I started the day with 27 bugs, after a long day of coding i got it down to the low number of 31" very relatable
 Michel#2879: what things should be in the description?
 Ber#3410: is DiceOut a good name for my breakout game?
 David T#4434: Hi guys. I love you
 CodingLord#1012: My entire code got an error and I guess the code was all completely wrong and now I am redoing all the code :(
 CFHM#9742: go for it, but i'm a scatterbrain and might not see it immediately lol
 Ragh#5984: 21400
 Chopper#3119: mind if i dm you an updated version when its done?
 sqrt#9237: HES GONNA TAKE YOU BACK TO THE PAST
 CFHM#9742: maybe slightly, and make the extremes a bit less extreme. Make the smallest less small, the biggest less big, and maybe turn down the rotation a tad
 Ell#3559: 1
 Cunnah#9270: >1
 sqrt#9237: guys
 Neossir#4982: How many people entered the GameJam?
 Chopper#3119: do you think less scaling or rotation?
 CFHM#9742:  - your main menu lookin good. but maybe turn down the motion on the title. it's a little distracting/hard to read
 Ceding Tree#1081: for a 2D die, you can get away with one square sprite, and change it out to simulate a roll
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Why is this emoji called call me
 Ceding Tree#1081: hoping I can get a second area designed tomorrow, gonna roll with the one good level for now though. Hopefully the RNG makes the level more exciting!
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: 🤙 same
 The_Charmeleon#5954: thank you so much
 The_Charmeleon#5954: thats so much smarter than waht i was trying to do
 Ceding Tree#1081: So I decided instead of making a seperate scene for the shop mechanic in my game, I'm just going to make an overlay, set all the other stuff besides BG inactive, then when Im done with shop, set that whole overlay inactive. Hopefully that saves a bit of time lol
 wren#0640: i feel like theres a lot more 3d games than other years this year?
 Lukey#6052: I just woke up and now I know the best thing about going to sleep in a game jam is when you wake up you fix like 5 coding errors super easily because your mind is so fresh.
 Viola_Buddy#6763: In any position of the die, you have a top, bottom, left, right, front, and back face. Keep track of all of them. For any given roll, you will move the faces around predictably (front may become right, for example), as long as you keep track of all six faces to begin with. And there are only four rolls possible (forward backward left right), so you can do it manually by hand.
 Ahat#0842: i might use some free assets
 Ceding Tree#1081: got it all working though!
 Ceding Tree#1081: long code, I had to go back 3 times because I kept missing one or two variables or refereneces to said variables 😛
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: Why did I decide to make a puzzle game?
 gnarbro#1627: oooof that sounds very tedious haha
 Shroomax#3378: good luck all of y'all i am gonna drop my project
 Ber#3410: holy hell 💀 30 minutes just to rename all of them
 Ceding Tree#1081: I decided to rename one of my assets in the code, and just got all of them changed 30 minutes later. What a headache though lol
 Ber#3410: because i guess different engines have different ways of making things (duh)
 The_Charmeleon#5954: why does it matter?
 Lukey#6052: 
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: What engine
 gnarbro#1627: My character controller is in if statement purgatory... trying to randomly adjust gravity
 The_Charmeleon#5954: hey im trying to code a dice that moves by fliping onto its side the problem is im working in an engine that dosent suport 3d and i need some way of setting the side numbers you can see the top side and the front side of the cube and i can individually change the numbers. how to i fugure out what numbers should be on the cube after a movement? ive tried many things and drawing where you can get from where on paper but i can't figure it out
 Ber#3410: makes sense
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: Almost usually implies <50% done
 Ceding Tree#1081: almost = 50% lol
 Ber#3410: yes thats what i meant by almost done
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: Almost done? Isn't there another 24 hours left
 Ahat#0842: ive been working for a while, making assets
 wumpus#3512: i mean 24 hours left isnt almost done, its halfway
 Ber#3410: the level is more important-
also the jam is almost done are you just starting? or did you just join
 duck123acb#0699: First level, it’s better to at least get some game play down
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: You need to do both so which one do you want to do the most? Don't do that one. You'll need the motivation later
 Ahat#0842: im stuck, i dont know what do , should i make the title screen or the first level????? and how?
 sqrt#9237: slim shady
 Vabenil#5485: Great supreme venerable heavenly emperor of probability
 Hederlunden#3231: more like pipis am i right
 Lukey#6052: wooo I'm awake!
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: Pip it's an adorable name, and the dots on the dice are called pips
 Sherbert Lemon#8177: too long to fit, I will just do Grombol
 Galactum#6235: yeah thats fair thanks
 dardasaba#9759: Take a break then! It will only help, and then you could come back with a fresh mind!
Working when you're tired will often only damage your game :)
 Ber#3410: i forgot to send an image in the progress pictures and i have to wait 14 minutes now 😭
 Galactum#6235: Grombol, King of Probability
 Peewi#8572: That's a dangerous game to play
 Vabenil#5485: If your heart tells you it doesn't then it doesn't need it, if it feels good to you then that's all you need in my opinion
 Galactum#6235: its been like 4 hours
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: Work on it for an hour --> ten minutes to do something you want
 Galactum#6235: i dont feel like working on the game anymore right now but i also havent gotten much done what do i do
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: Do dice games **need** randomness?
 Cunnah#9270: My sleep schedual is going to be really off. I slept through the hot part of the day
 Mukhavertolet#2243: make a plan of things you need to do. helps a lot. alright going to continue struggling bye everyone
 Redline#7370: anyways time to go slep 😴 cya
 WorkingJoe#4433: You're right, get back to work guys!
 dangertimmy#8239: hahaha fair point
 wumpus#3512: no point in chatting in here then!
 dangertimmy#8239: well i think it could be fun but it needs so much more work to get there
 WorkingJoe#4433: Yeah I'm not worried. There sure are a lot of literal dice rolling games though in the progress pictures. \:))) I love the puzzle ones I've seen so far (where moving changes your top number and you match that to tiles, for instance)
 Vabenil#5485: I spent the first day learning Godot and Now I'm rushing the game, you still got time
 Mukhavertolet#2243: you still have time to change that. why isn't it fun?
 wumpus#3512: been there, done that - you realise its because you have been working on it for 4 hours straight, and not because the concept isnt fun
 dangertimmy#8239: oops
 dangertimmy#8239: lol i'm realizing that my game just.. isn't fun
 dardasaba#9759: ^
 wumpus#3512: thats fine assuming its another interpretation of the word
 Cyndaquil#2646: Jiraya sensei🙏
 Mukhavertolet#2243: i still need to do attacking which should be pretty easy. i'm worried about ai of opponent
and effects and stuff too
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Super happy. Playtested like 30 games today XD
 wumpus#3512: I have manged to work on everything except the main feature of the game
 Russian posh cat support ukraine#6575: 22 hours left... how is everyone doing?
 Redline#7370: only 400? bruh
 Mukhavertolet#2243: uh that's bad. It took me like 5 hours to figure out movement, never done anything like this. try taking a short break, it helped me at least
 Scolon#4218: Halfway through today's dev session. Things are looking good. Though I'm not sure if I'll be able to add all the originally planned content. We'll see how it goes. I haven't even created the main player's sprites yet.
Going to start work on world tilesets
 Hederlunden#3231: my code is 400 lines long
 Hederlunden#3231: been stuck on a bug for 3 hours, with spaghetti code
 Cunnah#9270: I have a player character and a mechanic which I think is cool but I think needs more than 48 hours to truely explore. Currently its a glorified random attack
 Vabenil#5485: I'm not nervous, just regretting my life choices
 Cunnah#9270: I'm not nervous. Its ok if I don't finish I kinda hope I do. I am just glad I managed to come out of my comfort zone. Never done anything 3rd person before
 Mukhavertolet#2243: how's everyone doing?
 SpeedWolfy#3389: Hugs!
 SpeedWolfy#3389: All the sad and nervous dudes and dudettes, this is for you:
Everything will be alright! You're doing great, and if you are here now - you are heroes already!
 ImionJay#5937: With the exception of the crunch part, that is what I am going into this thing with. First time competitor and literally learning a new game dev software just for this.
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: yeah probably
 WorkingJoe#4433: I had only one game idea I really liked but it ended up being challenging to implement for unforeseeable reasons (some engine details). So wasted a lot of time. Think I'm now on the right track though
 wyrm_slayr#7477: As a programmer myself, he's probably twice as nervous :P
 Vabenil#5485: The programmers are most likely even more nervous
 dangertimmy#8239: i'm almost done with the basic mechanics, but haven't even thought about art yet. lol
 wumpus#3512: i had to cut yesterday early due to feeling incredibly nauseas which sucks
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: this jam is basically out of my hands, I've done most of the art and now it's up to the programmer. makes me nervous
 WorkingJoe#4433: I think I'll crunch and see if I can at least get something playable, even if it's ugly \:)
 zeidXD#0210: same :(
 Casper#6361: Anyways I am heading to bed now, best of lock everyone!
 Selviam#7268: im not even done the movement script yet so idk if ill have enough time for the jam
 GameDude#3494: Good or bad, at least I am practicing to not procrastinate and finish lol
 Jul#5331: +
 Cunnah#9270:  this assumes I have a "game" lol
 WorkingJoe#4433: I'm still working on the main mechanics (oof)
 investus#9902: comparing to yourself yesterday, it gets worse?
 Casper#6361: My best advice is to just do the best you can and have fun, other people can be professional game developers or hobbyist with years of experience. Comparing your game to theirs will only bring you down.
 WorkingJoe#4433: Yeah the interface definitely makes a good chunk of a game's feel
 Cunnah#9270: Anyone else feel there game is make or break based on how the player character handles. I have a player character but I am now worried everything else is "bare bones"
 Casper#6361: Ahahah space that always happens
 Mrinin#2181: OH, thank you! Googling "open 8 sided dice" didn't result in anything while every other dice gave something.
 Space#0859: I-... How
 Space#0859: I just saw a guy streaming the game he is making for the jam-
 AromaticA#3738: i ate the glue
 Viola_Buddy#6763: Wait... there are plenty of ways to do that if I'm understanding you correctly. Google "octahedron net" and the top results are images of such paper cutouts
 Ceding Tree#1081: You and me both buddy
 MrBen#0001: I need to relax
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: heyoo
 investus#9902: 🪲 ☕
 MrBen#0001: oof the 11 hour straight session wasnt good for me ngl
 Mrinin#2181: I am making a game about making dice out of paper cutputs, but appearently there is no good way to make a paper cutout for 8 sided dice. you just have to combine two 4 sided dice. I feel kinda cheated honestly.
 investus#9902: why i liked the old pc, because a big amount of coffe break, compile, a big bug coffe
 Delphine Noel#1196: 🦧
 KadDev#8100: thanks for the motivation!
 investus#9902: can you stop your boss to see the progress of work, without quit, less work
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i need to find a way to improve at dev specifically
 ChipmunkDev#1808: really? here come my anxiety attack
 keb#6637: still got a bunch of time even if i sleep
 Casper#6361: Don't stress us out now
 absolutelyivy#3850: don't remind me 😭
 qxt2019#6669: Shit
 Teslobo#8274: Wow, we've passed the 24 hours remaining mark
 Casper#6361: Keep at it and I'm sure you'll finish! Gamedev is really challenging on it own, add trying to come up with good game design onto that, and you have a hellish task
 keb#6637: i have been working all day. time to take a 1 hour long break
 farkon00#0500: Just finished all 5 locations and 3 out of 5 bosses done. Gonna finish bosses tomorrow add some mechanics for locations. And add squishy animations and particles.
 qxt2019#6669: Im so behind lol
 icekiller158#1816: yea, it is quite a lot. those laid off were mostly in the AI and the engineering department, the important departments in improving the game engine
 Stormzy18#6158: all i have rn is player movement, player sprites, and background tiles w/ wall collision. I still gotta do ui, weapon, enemies, and music
 KadDev#8100: well, I was informed of how much I don't know about game maker studio, and how much I need to practice, I learned to not depend on others, and I learned game maker studio 2 needs an update (with their horrible rotation system) because I don't know who is happy with it, and I learned that I am bad at making games quickly, but I hope I can finish it knowing how many people have helped me in this game jam and because I didn't finish my last game jam...
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i'm missing the main boss, finishing up  the level, adding the losecon, and a main menu. then it's all gonna be refinements
 ChipmunkDev#1808: my game is basically done, i just have to make the game 😄
 Casper#6361: I still have to add a lot of content
 krisis in a jar#0904: my game is basically done, just gotta polish and balance the attack patterns
 Casper#6361: Oh that sounds like very good progress
 qxt2019#6669: I still have to finish the core gameply tommorow and art and music
 JanbluTheDerg#1018: Just gotta level design, make UI, small stuff and polish (oh crap... forgot about sounds lol)
 GAMERNINJASK#1503: i have all the gameplay and levels, all i need, is now just polish
 Casper#6361: Good to hear, I am almost done with my gameplay loop and I already snuck in some polish work
 investus#9902: this hundred of employees laid for more profit is wrong, for product what do you think?
 nekotheasparagus#0809: I’m doing well. I tackled the hardest part of my game first and I think it’s working
 JanbluTheDerg#1018: I'm about to get wrapped up for the day
 Casper#6361: How is everyone doing, I just wrapped up for the day
 investus#9902: 200 dev, thats a lot, they would need 256 new devs to fix bugs
 Casper#6361: Hello
 investus#9902: o no that would make it even bigger and slower and more bugs
 N8#2718: threejs the place to be ngl
 icekiller158#1816: unity is merging with ironSource, which is well known for installing PUPs and adware
2 weeks prior the merger announcement, unity laid off 200 employees
 ChipmunkDev#1808: expierence defenitly helps
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: what this jam made me realize is that i need to start looking up resources to make the jump from intermediate to a more advanced developer. some of my ideas weren't worked on because i just had very little idea on what i could do to realize them and i feel like i'm missing some kind of framework to get from idea in my head > set of systems that works for my idea
 sqrt#9237: why is everyone suddenly hating on unity
 Zag#6205: im hoping my game isnt too boring; i only have time to implement one kind of enemy, with a bigger and stronger variant.
 JoaoCupido#0225: Ok then. Thank you!
 JuliusCube#8501: nothings stopping you, so yes it can. Im not sure if many people would find the game interesting at first glance, but it's a name.
 JoaoCupido#0225: I have a question: can the name of my game be the same as the theme name?
 1Am2Good4You#4414: the one with progress in the literal channel name ? XD
 Saru#2186: Thank you 🙏🏾 I didn’t know where the best place was to post progress.
 investus#9902: dice has normal 6 faces, and i have already seen d20 with 20 faces dice
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: in my game, you have 3 dice slots. defeating enemies has a chance to drop a dice, and whenever you get 3 dice that follow a pattern (are ordered or ordered inversely, every dice is odd, every dice is even, every dice is equal) you get a different effect, and usually, a stronger armor. but also, you always get health back equals to the highest die in your pool. you can also discard dice if you're missing only one for a pattern you need
 Redline#7370: so true
 JuliusCube#8501: well there would have been more if you went with your first idea
 Beeg scarf#3571: neat
 Selviam#7268: after some panicking i figured out how to make my dice roll in a 2d game, well make it *seem* like it is
 dardasaba#9759: Basically you rotate yourself so that the dots match the pattern of the oncoming projectiles
 ^_^#9116: hello
 CodingLord#1012: I am just rethinking if it is worth it to spend time in the jam.
 dardasaba#9759: Yes it does contribute
 Beeg scarf#3571: does it being a dice contribute anything or is it just because
 dardasaba#9759: I mean it's not really a player, but it's the thing you control
 bigblind#5722: I'm just creating an online version of an existing dice game
 dardasaba#9759: In mine the die is the player character
 Mukhavertolet#2243: basically everything
 Vabenil#5485: In mine it will be randomness
 Beeg scarf#3571: What does the dice dictate in your games
 Vabenil#5485: Now that you mention it, it would have probably been a much better idea for me to make my game using JavaScript instead of learning Godot from zero fro my game 😅
Too late for that now
 bigblind#5722: I entered into this jam late, and I'm not gonna have much time this weekend because of family matters, so I'm making a relatively simple web game. I made these dice that only use a single `` and a bunch of CSS gradients to display them. Feel free to copy them if anyone has a use for these at this point in the jam.
 Jasper#7906: Just wrapped up a major feature that adds more depth to the combat. From here, the planned features focus less on combat itself and more on what happens between battles (including upgrading the arsenal of dice you use in the battle), and stuff like what dice your enemies get and how they use them. But first, time for some downtime.
 Redline#7370:  hello kind sir
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: I seem like an old person here!
 v.o.i.d#1122: HELLO
 Saru#2186: Hey guys this is my first #GMTKJam just posted a preview of what our team is working on via twitter
 investus#9902: no game of the year here
 Galactum#6235: the game is now technically playable, although not fun at all because the actual good part of the game isn't implemented yet
 ^_^#9116: wohoo very good
 Galactum#6235: lets go i got the core of the gameplay done
 MrBen#0001: lol in my game when you flip level you can clip into ground. thats why all levels with flipping level has flat ground
 GuyWithTime#7852: Thats the spirit!
 ^_^#9116: kill them
 Redline#7370: oh god so many bugs
 skejeton#5788: you can probably do it with a matrix
 MrBen#0001: I still need more sounds and some camera shakes
 ^_^#9116: you really did
Congrats
 skejeton#5788: i had the exact same problem, and i'm not sure if gamemaker has it, but i solved it by having an interpolated transform, and a target transform. interpolated transform just interpolates to the target transform, and the target transform uses rotation stacking, when you rotate the target transform and then assign it to itself, i don't know if gamemaker has it
 Ultimate-Chicken-Guy#7212: What a reunion :)
 GuyWithTime#7852: That moment when you have everything nearly done but still dont have a sprite for the main character
 Making Dragons (Hassan)#7112: oh wait I just checked our dms I remember you lol
 ^_^#9116: hello did you sleep good?
 Ahat#0842: im currently making my title screen, then gonna make the first level, then credits and music then dones
 MrBen#0001: YOU ARE MY FRIEND FROM LIKE 1 YEAR AGO
 Making Dragons (Hassan)#7112: BEN YOU ARE HERE TOO?
 MrBen#0001: HDRAGON!? YOU ARE HERE!!! 👀
 Mukhavertolet#2243: same, i would be done at this point i think
 Fusoy#6101: I see 404 error, is your page public ?
 Making Dragons (Hassan)#7112: 404 not found
 investus#9902: upgrade for new features, and stop for incompatible code, c# project off the wall
 BatYaggy#3015: Me too. I always put the UI off until the very end.
 Azurezero#4851: yes because the other axis get rotated too
 swarm#1128: also i have a feeling i could have made the same game in 2d in half the time but, oh well
 Shroomax#3378: and the worst part is, it crashes every 3 seconds
 Making Dragons (Hassan)#7112: you could always try to look at it differntly(roll a  real dice, rng etc)
 skejeton#5788: is your problem about rotating dice cube?
 KadDev#8100: i'm facing the same problems, it's actually annoying
 BatYaggy#3015: Ah, janky engine.
 Shroomax#3378: i was editing a text from my script it's supposed to be like 1 line of code.
unity didn't build one of the libraries, took me 30 minutes to figure it out
 investus#9902: .net framework library , mono was a clone
 swarm#1128: i hate UI design i hate UI design i hate UI design i hate UI design i hate UI design i hate UI design
 Azurezero#4851: if game maker werent stupid and was consistent with rotations i could make devil dice, but since it is stupid, i cannot
 Shroomax#3378: like OH MY GOD WHAT THE FUCK MAN UNITY FAILS BUILDING LIBRARIES EVERY 2 SECONDS
 BatYaggy#3015: No! You can do it!
 OrangeKingdom#9769: All kind of music that boost me up
I use spotify so it plays randomly
 Azurezero#4851: i've given up, i just cant make a good game with the theme
 Shroomax#3378: i am just gonna scrap my project
 OrangeKingdom#9769: And that's a talent
Watching a series while making games
 investus#9902: what kind of music, is it pop rock?
 Ultimate-Chicken-Guy#7212: Don't even get me started on unity tile map...
 BatYaggy#3015: I have covid and I'm still trying to make my game.
 Shroomax#3378: I HAVE SO MANY BUGS OH MY GOD AND IT'S NOT MY SCRIPTING PROBLEM
freaking unity tilemap collider moment
 Making Dragons (Hassan)#7112: nice gravity falls is amazing
 Ber#3410: what
 LM#4371: Im rewatching gravity falls while working on my game
 Shroomax#3378: yeah okay i am not gonna submit
 Azurezero#4851: i thought that was the lewd one
 OrangeKingdom#9769: I listen to songs while making games😜
 Ber#3410: i wonder if anybody has ever made an actual jam game for a gamejam like the food? jam
 Super#7038: 24 hour in and i havent written a single line of code.
 LM#4371: Good, Im almost done with 7 hours of work alone
 Acu1000#5560: xddd insomnia xddd deppression XD
 Ber#3410: strawberry jam
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: how is your jam going ?
 investus#9902: if you have 24 hours, the question how many devs
 Fusoy#6101: Don't make fun of people telling you to stay healthy during a gamejam...
 LM#4371: I’ve spent 7 hours on my game and its almost done
 OrangeKingdom#9769: Yes, But I think I have enough time
 Acu1000#5560: theres still 24 hours left
 JowelYudisi#4271: any tips for a  mario party like dice based movement?
 Super#7038: Read my bio
 Ber#3410: it ends tommorow doesnt it
 investus#9902: insomenia or sleeples waveheat i mean heatwave
 Ber#3410: people that dont sleep for days working on a game: 😂😂
 OrangeKingdom#9769: Hey friends
Just finished all movement and animations and enemy Ai
Going to add the dice mechanic tommorow
Now I need to sleep 😴
 LM#4371: “Umm, actually… not getting any sleep is bad for your health🤓🤓🤓”
 philipl#0307: damn, y'all have some seriously impressive stuff in 
 Delphine Noel#1196:  tell me bro, i'm really doing that
 BadPiggy#5202: Aight. More or less done with my entry
Posted in  kek
 Delphine Noel#1196: noodles? prolly
 Hederlunden#3231: true, overrated af
 Ultimate-Chicken-Guy#7212: Guys does anyone know what goes into a spring roll?
 ZedDev#4726: That slowmode tho
 KadDev#8100: did you reply to the wrong comment, i'm a little confused😅
 Delphine Noel#1196: can you tell me what kind of rolls you were talking about here. The first type of rolls that turns into dice
 LM#4371: Sleeping is so mid bro, me and my homies are only gamejamming
 investus#9902: i know it because of 3 GB ram
 ZedDev#4726: 64 bit, had 32 before because 64 could't fit on the dvd
 Acu1000#5560: Yes, I work more efficiently when I'm not struggling to stay awake
 Hederlunden#3231: nah, we are just doing a little trolling to our health
 LM#4371: Great, thank you
 Minus#1843: Sleep? You guys are sleeping?
 investus#9902: really, is that 32bit win7 that runs so fast 140fps are supported in my pc
 Hederlunden#3231: we didnt need that sleep anyway
 KadDev#8100: I will have to sacrifice all my sleep lol
 Vabenil#5485: Anyway, procastination stop for now, cya all later
 Hederlunden#3231: ohno im in danger, i havent even started on the mechanic that makes the game special, or anything
 Vabenil#5485: I think I will have to sacrifice a good deal of sleep if I want to even have a chance to finish in time
 Ultimate-Chicken-Guy#7212: I can 100% agree
 Delphine Noel#1196: 24 actually there's also 54 minutes
 Ultimate-Chicken-Guy#7212: 23 hours
 Hederlunden#3231: 24 hou-
 Vabenil#5485: The right one. I use Arch btw
 LM#4371: How much time left until the end again? Cant look up rn
 Ultimate-Chicken-Guy#7212: Which distro?
 Vabenil#5485: Probably, I'm using Linux which also works great. But I'm using Godot which is already pretty light so it might be because of that
 KadDev#8100: I don't know if I'll be able to finish the game before the jam is over 😦
 ZedDev#4726: I'm using unity 2020 (and 2021) on a 2007 Imac running windows 7 with 3 gigs of ram. And my game runs at 140 fps in editor
 investus#9902: do you think that it runs faster in macos m1, i like to ask a friend to rotate computers
 Vabenil#5485: Good thing I'm using Godot then
 Acu1000#5560: pure chaos and insanity but I love it
 MassedUp#8420: it includes most things like menus, animations, sounds etc
 Scolon#4218: So how's it going in here
 Vabenil#5485: That's the windows experience
 investus#9902: yes, if that was godot, but updated unity 2022 and its so big now, stats slow, that could need a new pc even its new but faster
 ZedDev#4726: Restarting my computer before it kills itself. Its starting to heat up a bit too much and slowing down for no reasons
 Ultimate-Chicken-Guy#7212: I've also constructed several towers of doom
 wyrm_slayr#7477: That's right about where my code is now
 Ber#3410: yes
 Acu1000#5560: well maybe you can shrink this project a bit then
 FryDev#0372: what
 wyrm_slayr#7477: So y'all know how sometimes in cartoons things get so gross and slimy and messy that they come alive?
 MassedUp#8420: every single one
 investus#9902: silent pc without fan are to slow, like slow motion (but even older pc get noisy with software of today, and gigabytes of game and code)
 Acu1000#5560: think which of them are necessary for the game to even work and start with those
 FryDev#0372: oof
 MassedUp#8420: ending the day with about 14 more big tasks 😩
 Vabenil#5485: In a way I think is better to develop in potato pc, because if it can run in mine it can run on everyone's
 FryDev#0372: hm. things are going well. how much time is lef- oh no
 Acu1000#5560: fast doesnt have to mean loud though
 wren#0640: i should add some particles tbh but idk im not that experienced with godots particle system and i dont trust myself to make good enough pixel art animated particles
 investus#9902: i thought with fast pc you can do more, but it is more noisy hard to focus
 JOJO#9627: Like on every dice roll : booom
 Vabenil#5485: You could have two dices instead of balls, and every time you hit a dice, or both every time you hit both dices something happens (I hate my phone's autocorrect)
 Delphine Noel#1196: cables and vines? that's very specific
 JOJO#9627: Add explosions
 Acu1000#5560: you can take a break if you feel burnt out
 Jellogramming#4653: if that happens I just say "wouldn't it be so cool if this game was polished"
 MrBen#0001: I have good idea how to make game better:
- add more bloom
- add more particles
- add more cables and vines
 Ber#3410: what can i do with a breakout game 🤔 should i make a randomly spawning dice where when the ball hits it something random happens?
 investus#9902: is there a way to polish games if you have no motivation to continue what started
 Redline#7370: hah good luck with that
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I'm so happy. I just found time to play more games. :3 Gonna play everything in  :D
 E0115F 101#2073: Yea, just doing level design rn, still need sounds too
 Jellogramming#4653: my code is becoming spagheti
 Delphine Noel#1196: That's amazing, I guess your game is coming together nicely
 wren#0640: idk more content is always good if its level based
 Fusoy#6101: A jam game better be too short than too long
 investus#9902: you might integrate few gaptcha to stop ai playing cheating game
 E0115F 101#2073: better than I thought I would be doing
 JuliusCube#8501: why does it matter?
 Vabenil#5485: I do that in my mind all the time
 Redline#7370: why is that a problem
 wren#0640: just to show what im referencing?
 Hobusu#5033: It's expected that Jam games are going to be really short, so it's probably best not to worry about that too much and instead focus on making sure the time players do spend with your game is enjoyable
 Delphine Noel#1196: why are you replying to yourself
 Vabenil#5485: My brain is not good enough to design puzzles
 wren#0640: if you work for like 10 minutes on 1 puzzle youre probably gonna wanna see it through
 Vabenil#5485: You can also make things pretty difficult to increase game time, of course at the risk of scaring away the player
 Delphine Noel#1196: great how are you
 E0115F 101#2073: how is everyone doing?
 wren#0640: i feel like puzzle games have the benefit of sunk cost though
 Delphine Noel#1196: unless it's a puzzle game and the entire hour was spent figuring out the game
 FryDev#0372: yep
 wren#0640: no one will play your game for more than like 10 minutes unless its *really* good
 MrBen#0001: 5 mins is good
 Vabenil#5485: Depends, if you are making something like a rougelike you have pretty much infinite replayability, though you are right for anything else it's too much, my bad
 FryDev#0372: an hour of gameplay is too much imo
 wren#0640: an hour of gameplay could literally be a full complete indie release
 investus#9902: if i launch a [unpaid] game jame, than it would have a mario-world to go to the developers room to play and score from their games.
 wren#0640: i feel like an hour of gameplay is optimistic for literally anyone in a game jam
 Fusoy#6101: I think we will have more role playing game this year, at least the battle part
 snares#8483: just starting to work on animations, spent all of day 1 on character movement 😅
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Try to keep that stuff to it's own channel, alright? No need to spread it around more than one channel 🙂
 Jellogramming#4653: very polished, great work
 MrBen#0001: oh thats mine. My game speedrunned is 1 min
 MrBen#0001: how do you like it?
 Ahat#0842: lets go! i got my character and its aniamtions to work!
 FryDev#0372: it’s better to leave people wanting more than for them to be bored by samey levels
 Vabenil#5485: Yeah, you are probably right
 ZedDev#4726: My game is built on replayability
 Jellogramming#4653: my game is very short then
 BanananaMonke#3591: FRYDEV
 FryDev#0372: really, the ideal length for a jam game is 5-10 minutes
 Ber#3410: 💀
 ZedDev#4726: 19, started last summer and i'm 17 now but considering my birthday it would be 2 years
 Delphine Noel#1196: GMTK always chooses a theme for puzzle games and then wonder why are there so many puzzle games
 Arkeon#9826: just realise that i'm not at home tommorow and I have to finish my game today (it's 8:45pm)
 Vabenil#5485: I think if you have an hour of gameplay you got more than enough
 investus#9902: how many levels did have space invaders ?
 Redline#7370: let's do the stretching thing
 BanananaMonke#3591: yea i know 50 is a bit overkill acttually something like 10-15/ the levels are quite short
 wyrm_slayr#7477: That reminds me, if you were to add the number of years you've been doing game jams to how old you were when you started, what would that number be?
 Ber#3410: i dont wanna perish
 JuliusCube#8501: 🍌 🦧
 wren#0640: im aiming for like 15 levels minimum?
 investus#9902: did someone use bundles in sepearate games in itch.io but loading shared
 nilsmunch#2823: Hey gang, hope you are faring well out there. Remember to take care of your **mental health**, no matter how well you fare.
If you need to have a talk, don't be afraid to reach out. I'm taking a break from my own project now and would love to playtest your games, or just listen to how you are faring out there. 🙂
And as the Danish national anthem goes : **Remember to drink water, or you will surely perish.**
 ZedDev#4726: levels are overrated, embrace procedural generation and randomness!
 Jellogramming#4653: you better have tons of level making tools ready if you are trying to do that
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Let's not spam emojis, aight?
 wren#0640: rn i only have 7 and like 3 of them are just to introduce mechanics 😬, trying to take my time with level design though dont wanna just add levels for the sake of bumping up a number
 Fusoy#6101: In a gamejam game, you probable want to make less level, but that all show the potential of your ideas. People are hardly gonna spend more than 5 minutes playing your game, keep it short !
 Delphine Noel#1196: Monke
 BanananaMonke#3591: 🦧
 Ber#3410: monk
 Delphine Noel#1196: 🦧
 wren#0640: i really need to add more levels
 investus#9902: everyone has special abilities, like in final fantasy, if you know more you are slower and meight make wrong decissions because of culture
 BanananaMonke#3591: it is a 3D puzzle game so.. yea
 Vabenil#5485: Anyway whether or not you are kid doesn't matter. Only the games matter for today
 Hobusu#5033: I'd suggest making the minimum number of levels you can to have a 'complete' experience, uploading that, then spending the remaining Jam time adding more levels and/or fixing bugs, that way you can rest easy knowing no matter what happens you'll have *something* submitted
 Delphine Noel#1196: Monke
 BanananaMonke#3591: i am 14
 ZedDev#4726: Unless its a Puzzle game or 3D, yeah
 Redline#7370: excuse me?
 Jellogramming#4653: can we stop this conversation, being a kid doesn't make you more or less capable
 BanananaMonke#3591: its quite easy :)
 CodingLord#1012: Can yall just stop the debate, No one is a kid, everyone is individual person with equal abilities
 Vabenil#5485: Yeah, but the older you get the longer you think in your head "Am I doing something dumb right now?" And when I was 14 I didn't even start making that question in my mind yet
 ZedDev#4726: Pain
 BanananaMonke#3591: les goo main game done, now just adding 50 levels
 Redline#7370: so true now let's move on
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Yeah let's not make any generalizations about how kids are, yeah?
 ZedDev#4726: Do you know how painful it is to draw an Icosahedron?
 epicman#3996: everyone younger than me is a kid at any point in time
 JuliusCube#8501: would you guys call an extremely mature 14 year old a kid or a teen?
how about an extremely mature 12 year old? or what about a 6 year old? You cant really anwser the question of who is a kid or a teen, there isnt really a hard boundary on "kid v teen" except anything greater than 13 is a teen.
 Delphine Noel#1196: Everyone Younger than you is a kid
 Redline#7370: everyone makes dumb mistakes sometimes so that's not true
 CodingLord#1012: Then why do I treated like one 💀
 thisisnotaustin#0005: i think people stop being kids in their early to mid twenties
 Delphine Noel#1196: I wouldn't really ask that from a 4 year old though, they will most likely say that they are kids
 Vabenil#5485: At that age they still do dumb mistakes and often fail to take rational desitions, depends on the person of course but it's true for most
 ZedDev#4726: Okay finished drawing 5 different dices in 2D, now i need upgrade icons, then i can start making the enemy ai
 sushiman#4823: Hi if anyone has a strange weapon idea he can give me in dm because I will sleep ^^
 investus#9902: instead going to school, it have been better to be a sport living legend or so
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: every kid believes their age is when you stop being a kid. you can literally ask a four year old and they'll say that
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: yeah, I’m the artist
 Delphine Noel#1196: you're in a team?
 Redline#7370: there's a certain point where you'd say that someone isn't a kid anymore around 14 when they start becoming more serious and polite
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: we have no gameplay yet but we do have a character creator lmao, we’ll get there though
 MinccinoLuna#0662: only goats can be kids
 thisisnotaustin#0005: 19 definitely, 20 debtably. depends on your perspective i guess.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: not even Technically, 14 is The Second Year of being a teen
 Hobusu#5033: Always nice to see someone recognize how valuable sound design is!
 BadPiggy#5202: Depends tbh lol ( referring to 19 and 20 year olds I mean )
 JuliusCube#8501: not technically, 14 is a teen.
 Itooh#5008: I'm satisfied with the concept I had, but there's still a lot to implement before it's operational. I'm afraid I won't have much time for art or sound-design (that last part being imho one crucial thing to produce a satisfying experience). 😅
 thisisnotaustin#0005: teens are kids. even 19 and 20 year olds are basically kids in my eyes
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i'd argue anyone 19 or below is a kid actually
 Delphine Noel#1196: everyone below *me* is a kid
 Vabenil#5485: Anyone under 18 is a kid
 JanbluTheDerg#1018: I remembered when someone (probably Mark) mentioned how people think it's more fair when the dice seems to have been rolled physically, so I made that the entire game
 investus#9902: happy c++ assember code
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: nah everything below 18 is a kid
 thisisnotaustin#0005: 14 is definitely a kid
 Ber#3410: 14 isnt a kid
everything under 12 is a kid
 JuliusCube#8501: im pretty much done with all the juice and polish, Im planning to add a couple more levels, and i need stuff like a main menu. I dont really know what else I need.
 BadPiggy#5202: I'm guessing Mark chose this theme because randomness from dice games is generally unfun
Our task is to actually find the fun lol
 dQw4w9WgXcQ#8475: Pc bluescreened making me lose progress and I called it quits lmao
 CodingLord#1012: I just wanted to know if I was the only kid here or something 😭  but now everyone hates me for asking
 Fusoy#6101: I'm not sure about my game. It's not *that* fun to play. I'm trying to fix that at the moment
 Ber#3410: i had a tetris idea i have 0 clue how to make it work so im making a breakout game now
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: ggj is really a bunch of smaller jams jammed together
 thisisnotaustin#0005: because it's an uncomfortable question to be asked
 BadPiggy#5202: I'm pretty much finished with my game
Just need to add SFX now
 CodingLord#1012: Selff satisfaction. Why care?
 Hobusu#5033: How's everyone's games coming along? Any fun ideas?
 Delphine Noel#1196: It's crazy how GMTK is so big even though there are no prizes for winners. The motivation is really just to have fun
 JuliusCube#8501: global game jam is bigger but its not online only iirc (except during the early pandemic)
 Redline#7370: god why am I so hungry
 thisisnotaustin#0005: nothing good. so why ask?
 BadPiggy#5202: Aliens after playing goat simulator :
Leave them. They have creatures far powerful than us among them
 CodingLord#1012: I dont have any dirty thoughts 💀  Besides what can I do by knowing if you are over 18
 investus#9902: i dont know what does age do with game, game is for everyone even aliens
 Redline#7370: I literally don't care what they do with that information, and it's public knowlege and can be found in a lot of places on my channel
 BadPiggy#5202: GMTK is probably the biggest tbh. Alongside global game jam
Unless GGJ is smaller ?
 CodingLord#1012: I am a kid or teen :(
 thisisnotaustin#0005: well, you shouldn't ask that, generally
 JuliusCube#8501: *online* jam
 CodingLord#1012: because I am 14 and I just wanted to know if you all are adults
 nekotheasparagus#0809: Advice: don’t answer the random person online asking your age
 Ber#3410: your not supposed to ask people their age 💀
 Delphine Noel#1196: why? can't kids make games
 thisisnotaustin#0005: why do you ask
 Redline#7370: no I'm literally 15
 investus#9902: i
 CodingLord#1012: By the way, are you all 18+ ? How many of you are over 18?
 Delphine Noel#1196: global game jam? ludum dare?
 nekotheasparagus#0809: If you want a simple way to implement the theme, use a randomizer and make the random element important
 Mavelan#6612: I'm submitting my project rn.
 Jellogramming#4653: the point of game jams is to learn something new and have fun doing it
 investus#9902: i played the old final fantasy, and it was more logical than random
 JuliusCube#8501: the GMTK jam really is the biggest online jam tho
 Delphine Noel#1196: Just make snakes and ladders
 Ceding Tree#1081: You can play test your own games, surely! Will it be a biased playtest? yeah for sure. But the point is to have fun right?
 thisisnotaustin#0005: tons of JRPGs use tons of randomness and still let you strategize around it
 MrBen#0001: thats how Mark described it. I just copied it
 Ceding Tree#1081: I think games like the orinal Final Fantasy werent really random, but more logical/strategy based.
 Delphine Noel#1196: What I meant was that in order to figure out what feels fun and what doesn't, you have to do some playtesting, which is not possible in a game jam
 Ber#3410: i meant like something i knew how to do
 MrBen#0001: to what?
 Redline#7370: the last sentence is kinda clickbait I'd change that
 thisisnotaustin#0005: game jam themes are never easy, you just gotta make something
 Ceding Tree#1081: True, but you can do both I think! I'm trying to be fair, but random at the same time. If you would like I could send you a link to my game when its playable? I could always use some feedback!
 Hederlunden#3231: do it then
 Jellogramming#4653: you still have 24 hours
 MrBen#0001: how do you like my game description:
Unexpected Shift is a simple, short and sweet puzzle platformer game which will mess with your mind.
Basics - The game itself has a really simple concept. You start in a room where you need to find and reach your destination point . First level seems pretty easy but everything changes when you encounter a dice that is too high to reach. Using special abilities you are able to: change gravity, flip levels, move platforms, stop the time and much more! This game does not only require platforming skills but also an ability of thinking logicly.
The game's style is based on LIMBO - a graphicly impressive platformer game. The game you are about to install was made in 48 hours during the biggest game making marathon - GMTK gamejam 2022.
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: don't say that,my idea is quit complicated but this time i did it and it works
 thisisnotaustin#0005: turn based combat almost *always* uses randomness doesn't it
 Ber#3410: wait i couldve done like a breakout type thing 😭 that would be easy
 investus#9902: Bart said at schoolday, pacman eat my code the letters on the board, do while testing
 Delphine Noel#1196: Point of games is to have fun, not fair.
 Ber#3410: like i waited a month for this theme which i cant do anything easy with
 Ceding Tree#1081: Who said random had to be fair? Is true randomness fair?
 Jellogramming#4653: I thought I overscoped, but I'm almost done already
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: yeah,the time is very slow,i finish 75% of my game
 Ber#3410: im just giving up
 Delphine Noel#1196: happens everytime
 [killcode3.0]#6580: this is taking longer than I thought, anyone else forced to drastically scope down due to time?
wish it was 3 or 4 days jam
 Redline#7370: so based
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: mute him like you muted me
 Jellogramming#4653: my code is becoming 🍝
 JJfriends#3686: fuck my dad is making me do chores shit
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: fixed !
 Delphine Noel#1196: The only reason I didn't do that is because of randomness it might seem unfair at times without a lot playtesting to see what level of  randomness is fun to play with.
 wumpus#3512: i used to use libresprite, didnt have onion skinning as far as i could see - pretty useful for pixel animation
 Jupiter_Butts#3521: Ok! Hahaha thanks! Kinda cheered me up abit
 investus#9902: you got it, the weather data of ballons can be usefull, and instead of rolling dice, use the tornados and heatwave
 thisisnotaustin#0005: anyway, good luck everyone
 Delphine Noel#1196: I'm using libre sprite
 Ceding Tree#1081: I was really leaning towards a turn based battler for my own sake, then the theme got introduced and seemed to fit in pretty well!
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Don't be hard on yourself! Try to get the distractions out of the way, then get cracking!
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: I just realised i inversed the 2 with the five ;-;
 Redline#7370: I'm a photoshop gamer 😎
 Jellogramming#4653: I'm using piskel
 Jupiter_Butts#3521: I keep... Procrastinating. Am I a dumbass loser???
 thisisnotaustin#0005: oh yeah, it was yesterday, lol. well i already resigned myself to not having enough time to work on anything unfortunately
 Delphine Noel#1196: How do I use webcam for sky? you mean the camera right?
 wumpus#3512: anybody else cheap and using compiled aesprite lmao
 Ceding Tree#1081: One scene called main menu, one scene called BattleScene lol
 Delphine Noel#1196: lol that was literally the first thing I thought originally, I guess first ideas aren't that original
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: 24 hours ago
 Galactum#6235: Yeah i probably should do that too, right now working on death screen though
 thisisnotaustin#0005: yes. the theme was only announced this morning, right? and i'm doing vacation-related stuff all day
 Jellogramming#4653: I renamed it to "Game" because I made a menu scene
 Ceding Tree#1081: Well, what I'm doing is a turn based battle game where dice rolls determine the outcome of the battle! if that helps with your ideas
 GuyWithTime#7852: Just a quick reminder for everyone to stay hydrated
 Galactum#6235: Random question to those working in Unity:
Is your scene still called SampleScene?
 investus#9902: heat-spectrum, red for nr 1, and very cloudy for 8
 Delphine Noel#1196: have you not even made the game? is that what yo're saying? or do you just need someone to publish your game
 thisisnotaustin#0005: will do, thanks!
 Delphine Noel#1196: ok I'll add that. Next Idea
 investus#9902: you could install a webcam for the sky and roll the dice by clouds
 thisisnotaustin#0005: wdym?
 Taccos#1054: i already got the main mechanic working perfectly, now time for the aim down sights
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Enjoy your vacation!
 Ceding Tree#1081: You could make rolls, that turn into dice, that roll, and turn into sweet rolls.
 Delphine Noel#1196: you can submit earlier?
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: the platforms rolls.
 thisisnotaustin#0005: hey guys i'm leaving for vacation tonight and i won't be at my computer to participate. does anyone want my idea for this jam?
 Ceding Tree#1081: The main character rolls?
 Delphine Noel#1196: what, how are things going to roll when there is only the main character yet
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I'm looking at . All those games that I haven't played yet looking at me.
 Delphine Noel#1196: My laptop runs fine,but I haven't really done any heavy 3D work yet in godot
 Ceding Tree#1081: ___ = Dice rain from the sky, and cause things to roll?
 investus#9902: well my computer gets noisy from head, of monday and tuesday
 Delphine Noel#1196: How about you guys help me with an idea,
It's a  platformer and everytime you press a button. A dice is rolled and __________________ happens
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Well best of luck!
 investus#9902: how do your computer do?
 Ceding Tree#1081: Asks: How are you doing? Responds:...........Nervous sweating, flips keyboard off of desk, throws ceramic bowl of chips against wall........"I'm fine!"
 investus#9902: godot sound fun with c# but in webgl i see not enough fast 3d to make a game
 xTacobaco#0200: ok
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: How are you all doing?
 Ceding Tree#1081: Well hi there!
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Hello!
 Ceding Tree#1081: I cant stop playing, and mine has no polish looooool
 Ceding Tree#1081: Thats a great sign lol
 Scolon#4218: Man I added a bit of polish now I can't stop playing lmao
 Delphine Noel#1196: godot works better with GD script. C# is just *another* way. I don't think random dice roll is that hard to do lol
 Ceding Tree#1081: Everyone works at their own pace!
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: so now I will make this challenge for me
finish the rest of the game SUPER UNPOLISHED in the next 3 hours so I get feedback for tommorow
 Basky#7894: they are 10 times better at this than me
 Delphine Noel#1196: The theme is mostly about randomness than rolling a dice
 investus#9902: well you could also use c# and i am shure there are a lot of scripts for random dice roll in 3d/2d
 CodingLord#1012: I know but still
 BurgerWizard#8683: guys, is it a good idea that im making a game with a wordplay on the theme? role instead of roll because it sounds the same
 Delphine Noel#1196: GD script  what kind of button hitbox? the default ones don't have hitbox
 TheGameShePlays#7762: So I think at this point I can say my game looks great and functions as it's supposed to, but it relies on a bit of a plot (and associated puzzling) and I'm just here trying to think very hard about the Romans 😂
 investus#9902: are you doing that with c# or with godot-basic-cppScript
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: How to make button hitbox invisble in godot ?
 Xurnt#2932: You shouldn't compare yourself to others, what matters is that you feel proud of what you've done, no matter how small.
 Delphine Noel#1196: like do I make the fights happen with dice or random attack with dice or maybe random level with dice. Godot I said that yesterday as well
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: what engine are you using ?
 Delphine Noel#1196: Oh that's cool, I would love to see that. I wanted to make a platformer but don't know where I'll add the dice
 CodingLord#1012: seeing   demotivates me by telling me how much progress people had made.
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: no,plateformer
 Delphine Noel#1196: puzzle game?
 arguingjaguar#5819: Yeah I’m getting a friend to animate
 Delphine Noel#1196: that's good
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: 75% done ! just need to finish the only level in the game and do some *finition*
 CodingLord#1012: The exams suddenly appeared but I really wanted to participate in the jam so here I am. I am big brain so exams dont worry me
 Ceding Tree#1081: So I decided to make a turn based battle system where the roll of the dice determines if you attack, heal, or something else. Trying to keep it simple with a battle mechanic and a shop mechanic to reward the player for battling lol. So far the battle system works like a charm, now I gotta figure out a whole new mechanic. In what, 23 hours? no problem............but really..........not anxious at all.............:P
 Maynu#4742: Hi from Thailand!
 Delphine Noel#1196: Unlucky
 CodingLord#1012: I have an exam on Monday
 Tapu#9161: Day 3 of Game Jam
 arguingjaguar#5819: Pvp/boss rush game inspired by cuphead and D&D
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: i finished my basic rpg mechanic
 Delphine Noel#1196: High five
 Redline#7370: obviously duh
 investus#9902: cool, tell us more about your idea in short
 TheDepressedGamer#3341: ahhh, my project seems to be the toughest to code
 Delphine Noel#1196: I meant the progress not the video
 arguingjaguar#5819: I’m going to not sleep for 24 hours to finish my idea
 Delphine Noel#1196: I don't have patience for this cooldown, it's giving me anxiety
 Redline#7370: that's not how that works *cough*
 Ceding Tree#1081: If I had the upload speed loool
 Delphine Noel#1196: Livestream it
 Ceding Tree#1081: I just screen recorded 2 minutes of what I have so far, its my first every attempt at Youtube too 😛
 Delphine Noel#1196: Agreed, I made physical devlogs of my first game
 CodingLord#1012: They are fun to watch and read but not fun to make
 Delphine Noel#1196: they are fun though I always read them
 CodingLord#1012: I dont have the time, skill, patience and energy to make a Devlog
 wumpus#3512: most people record and edit after the jam has ended
 Delphine Noel#1196: Dude people be making their game and making an entire video on it too all in jam time, like damn. It would take me two days just to edit
 CodingLord#1012: No, my concept doesnt need multiplayer. Its singleplayer
 MonkeyDLuffy#0620: wish i had friends how know about music
 Delphine Noel#1196: LUDO is a multiplayer game though, do you really think we all got friends to judge your game.
 Ceding Tree#1081: Thank you, sorry!
 Redline#7370: 
 Super#7038: Well atleast i have made 12 animations already. 🙂
 CodingLord#1012: I am so demotivated after finding everyone thought of LUDO.
 Phallo#3476: oof, wishing you luck! 🙂
 investus#9902: researched in Jupiter there are 30 hours a day
 MonkeyDLuffy#0620: oh my bad
 Lamster#5341: bro same
 MonkeyDLuffy#0620: same here🤣
 Delphine Noel#1196: lol I meant actual beatboxing not some software would be cool to see beatboxing in a game
 Shimp#0064: based
 MonkeyDLuffy#0620: oh its free??
 Ratonton#6819: i left i'm gonna play 3d among us
 CodingLord#1012: so my idea is not original and fun?
 Fusoy#6101: When is the first recorded dice in history ?
 BanananaMonke#3591: damn
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: we have a working character creator LETS GOOO
 Delphine Noel#1196: Ludo is literally the oldest idea with dice probably
 Redline#7370: FL studio or if I don't have time then *RoyaltyFreePlanet* on youtube
 gamedevperson#8448: i live on jupiter 😔
 Jasper#7906: music, what's that? 😉
 Ratonton#6819: there is no music in my games more simple
 Shimp#0064: hi king of the pirates, i ask my friend for his beats lol
 Delphine Noel#1196: beatbox
 CodingLord#1012: Bro I thought LUDO would be orignal idea, how has everyone thought of LUDO :((((
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Heyo.
 MonkeyDLuffy#0620: question, How do you guys create music for game??
 FryDev#0372: welp, I just finished my cowboy run animation, time for a break
 Ratonton#6819: CHAMPION
 Fusoy#6101: What if LUDO, but you have to search for the lost dice in the house in complete chaos ?
 Delphine Noel#1196: I'm proud of you son
 CrazyTurtle2000#3954: This Jam thing is relentless XD, I'm struggling so haarrrrd...
 CodingLord#1012: OMG My game is literally LUDO
 Shimp#0064: congratulate me guys, i managed to crash unity for the first time
 Delphine Noel#1196: Ludo is with gravity,  and I don't even know what the heck is LUDO driving, but chances are, very hard to do in one day
 Ratonton#6819: i will do my game on scratch personally
 investus#9902: i had same idea to use addressables, and just load a level, as one 1. game to load next 2. game stage (2 games bundles)
 wyrm_slayr#7477: That's LUDOcrous!
 kablouser#4232: What if a random game is chosen when the program starts
 Mark Brown#6982: what if LUDO but real-time, what if LUDO but driving, what if LUDO but rhythm-based, what if LUDO but with gravity, what if LUDO but...
 Delphine Noel#1196: I'm probably just gonna make some LUDO platformer type thingy
 Ratonton#6819: they look terrible i'm not an artist
 Jolly Ask#0856: the double jammy whammy
 wyrm_slayr#7477: Same except for that looking incredible part
 investus#9902: wow 2 games
 Delphine Noel#1196: Everytime I think of making a game with dice. I can't think of anything other than LUDO
 Ratonton#6819: i posted two game on itch theys look very bad
 Redline#7370: my game looks incredible but there's are a lot of features still missing and there are very few enemies
 investus#9902: on a friend tv, we used to restart the tv, because there was no sound for mtv
 Ratonton#6819: yeah but...
 wumpus#3512: still 24 hours!
 The Mayday Man#8467: the jam started yesterday
 Delphine Noel#1196: it's literally the start of the jam, I haven't even started yet
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: mark deliriously rants about games for eight hours without noticing the stream isn't on
 Ratonton#6819: me i'm gonna leave the jam i can't restart a game now
 investus#9902: sourcecode and assets are larger than the binary of game, so it needs some free traffic and fast and update, but not gihtub because no team only feature for free
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: also in those circumstances i dunno if you'll be even able to stream, like, cognitively
 Mr.Boda#3589: Same 
 Ratonton#6819: which version ?
 Mark Brown#6982: I might have to start streaming from Wednesday, rather than Mon/Tue - not really safe to sit a room full of computers presenting non-stop for hours
 BurgerWizard#8683: thanks :), as a jew, I couldn't do anything on Saturday and tomorrow there's a fast xD wish me luck
 Super#7038: I have been having to do all the art for my jam game on a phone and i havent event started the code all because i haven't had access to my pc, but luckily in and hour or so i should get access to it, so i guess im not sleeping tonight.
 Phallo#3476: with high levels of struggle but tbh... still really good quality/output
 Mr.Boda#3589:   yes  me too
 MrBen#0001: very good
 Ratonton#6819: ye
 (유)니티 좋음/나찰 니티#7281: You zip file it and send it using gmail or email
 Jellogramming#4653: how are you still deving
 Mr.Boda#3589: Am u ity
 investus#9902: in general
 MrBen#0001: best pfp ever
 BurgerWizard#8683: unity teams?
 investus#9902: in saturn there are 36 hours a day
 Phallo#3476: ive only slept 3 hours since the jam started and i dont plan on sleeping anytime soon... i will also prolly die when the jam is over 😛
 Jellogramming#4653: you still got about 25 hours
 investus#9902: how you share the code resources for the team only, but free not github and not limited to few users (previus ftp free traffic)?
 Ratonton#6819: oof
 BurgerWizard#8683: oh no, im starting the jam now xD
 Pixel#9717: dude same
 Ratonton#6819: ok
 Jellogramming#4653: Michigan, United States
 BanananaMonke#3591: like and supscribe if you live on earth!
 Ratonton#6819: where are you from ?
 BanananaMonke#3591: its 2022 here
 Jellogramming#4653: it's 1:46 pm here
 MrBen#0001: same to me
 Ratonton#6819: here it's 7:45 pm
 CodingLord#1012: Its 11:15 PM in my land, I will stay up for a few hours. Must Make Game
 redseiko#0001: Unity now defaults to YAML text serialization so it makes it pretty easy
 wumpus#3512: i guess im lucky, godot hasnt crashed once yet
 Ratonton#6819: i was closing unity to do a backup and a error message pop and when i reopen the project it was corrupt
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: yea my unity crashed once yesterday and i  was able to recover the scene
 Acu1000#5560: I need to start using github too
 redseiko#0001: Using github to sync between us, so we always have version control in case
 Acu1000#5560: do you have a backup?
 Redline#7370: how are you guys corrupting projects with crashing? I already crashed mine at least 5 times and nothing happened
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: RIP
 Ratonton#6819: unity just crashed project corrupt 😦
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Better to get something uploaded and improve it later than accidently run out of time perfecting things!
 Acu1000#5560: Ok my game's core systems are 95% done
 wumpus#3512: yeah, imma upload now - the game is "complete" but still requires some serious polish and an extra feature or 2 (oh and i need to make all the art - still programmer art)
 investus#9902: use batler to update, faster differencial and automaticaly it saves times for windows and of course WebGL html.zip n my page, is the script win10+
 foggles#9833: found something that i need to learn properly more than i need to finish this jam on time, so i'm tapping out
good luck everyone, looking forward to all the finished stuff 👍
 Acu1000#5560: hi mark
 Arihan10#7379: ah okay 👍
 OrangoMango#0973: lol
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: And yeah, in the likely event itch's servers go down, we'll probably extend the timer and let you know in 
 Mark Brown#6982: I mean you literally, physically cannot submit once the timer is over, so get it done in time!
 Acu1000#5560: 
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Yeah, just submit it early and you get to watch all the dumdums who didn't heed my ill portent of coming doom scrabble around and beg for special exemptions which they won't get
 Arihan10#7379: In case itch.io servers are down, will the timer be extended beyond the 50 hour limit?
 OrangoMango#0973: done?
 Acu1000#5560: Upload when game starts working, then you can keep uploading newer versions
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Submit on time. Ez pz.
 OrangoMango#0973: lol
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: doesn't get counted
 wumpus#3512: what happens if you are like, a couple minutes late
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: once the timer elapses, there is no grace period and your submission won't be counted
 Acu1000#5560: Yep, the last 2 hours are meant to be last resort if you fail
 Avadak#8772: no pun intended?
 JJfriends#3686: scam (joking)
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Which is to say you should submit your game at the 48 hour mark, not at the 50 hour mark
 Mark Brown#6982: (unless itch.io dies, in which case the timer will be extended)
 Avadak#8772: its been accounted for already, 50 hours, instead of 48
 Michel#2879: Java mentioned, michel summoned
 Arihan10#7379: Ah got it, thanks!
 Mark Brown#6982: after that, the jam ends
 Mark Brown#6982: Nope! The jam is 50 hours - two more than the usual 48 hours, so that is your submission time/grace period
 Arihan10#7379: One question- is there a grace period for submission at the end of the jam?
 Avadak#8772: try the Caribbean, this is a living furnace...
 investus#9902: therefore use c#  better than c++ pointer blue screen
 wumpus#3512: yep, being in the south of Britain kinda sucks rn lmao
 Mark Brown#6982: i'm doing some unity and the temp is causing my brain to make the dumbest mistakes
 Mark Brown#6982: i apologise to anyone who is having to make games in this heat
 investus#9902: so great they just use uefi shell, and load the game straight from bios efi: Doom 2
 JJfriends#3686: start menus are over rated we don't even need them
 TheSunCat#1007: I run Linux as an efi executable with efistub, I think.
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: no problem 🙂
 BanananaMonke#3591: free triggers my brain
 TheSunCat#1007: You get to work much more closely with what the computer is doing.
 Syton#9947: ooo I see. cool!
 OrangoMango#0973: yeah It's more challenging
 Syton#9947: Good idea! Thanks 🙂
 TheSunCat#1007: But it's fun!
 BanananaMonke#3591: what... thanks!
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: i would just post something about your game on Reddit, like r/Unity3D or r/playmygame
 OrangoMango#0973: try freesound.org
 Syton#9947: sure..
 Aiminer357#8033: so after the jam, there are gonna be a lot of people asking to "trade" reviews (me included). feel free to DM them for review and you review their game in return
 investus#9902: asembler booting operation system
 who-is-Ellie#8917: honestly own engine > unreal, unity, godot, etc.
If you're actually wanting to turn gamedev into a career then being able to have full control is a godsend
 BanananaMonke#3591: thanks!
 OrangoMango#0973: me too but in Java
 Ber#3410: same
 MrBen#0001: no need to make ur own engine lol
 who-is-Ellie#8917: people are better off not seeing mine tbh
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: i use sfxr to make 8-bit sound effect such as jumping,shooting,coin and it's randomly generated
 TheSunCat#1007: Yeah it's mainly just a nicely structured wrapper for OpenGL calls.
 BanananaMonke#3591: how do you guys make/find sound effects?
 Syton#9947: Say, you guys do anything to "marketize" your game? Like, there are so many jammers, how do I make sure people see my game?
 who-is-Ellie#8917: i mean a really basic engine is just an interface for a graphics API like DirectX, OpenGL or Vulkan.
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: i would like to know how you wrote your own engine
 GAMERNINJASK#1503: how, do you write your own engine?
 Ber#3410: doesnt it end tommorow
 TheSunCat#1007: It's C++. I wrote my own engine 😅
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: 0_0
is that even c#? 
 blarphblublub#9702: good night
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: bye
 TheSunCat#1007: I can't believe this game jam has led me to write code like this...```cpp
if) {
human.setAnimation;
Util::doLater { human.setAnimation("dead"); }, 300);
}```
 Frozen#7676: Until you realize you missed a single ;
 Khush#5581: I will figure out something tomorrow, Bye
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: yes
 Ber#3410: when ever you dont save or accidently delete something dont you ever just wanna stop development
 blarphblublub#9702: Edit: welcome to life
 Khush#5581: Edit : suffering for hours straight
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: yayyy!!!!11!11!
 Amelia-chan#4996: welcome to game dev, the world of debugging for hours straight
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: yea when that happens i uaually got to the comments and sort by new to see if anyone has the same problem im facimg
 Khush#5581: Well its night in my TZ
Goodnight
 blarphblublub#9702: Are you planning on making a tutorial screen or something of the like? took me a while to understand what was going on in those progress pics. You did a great job btw looks great! 
 Vubobinali#0059: i ewacfn
 Khush#5581: I literally copied the same code brakeys used in his tutorial
 MrRedShark77#2280: of course, all good
tbh i know
 ΒatmenzDW#1848: ^ lol
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: damn
When in doubt, binge-watch Brackeys
 blarphblublub#9702: haha I was wondering why I couldn't add reactions, just realized why rn
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: People are not obligated to give you feedback. You've posted in progress pics and that's great if people have feedback then they can give you it. You can refresh the image of gif you posted and mention that you posted it with a link to the message but please stop complaining about people not responding. It's unfortunate but people are busy
 Khush#5581: Really simple but im new to game dev
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: ikr
 Khush#5581: Yes
 Frozen#7676: I hate how you cant add reactions to progress pictures. I would love to show support for all of the people there
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: so it was aiming and shooting?
 Khush#5581: Whoops
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: what was the bug
 Khush#5581: Aiming and shooting
 Khush#5581: Shit
 GuyWithTime#7852: My levels are literally based around the dots of a die so level design wont be that hard
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: wait wha-
 Hederlunden#3231: thanks, and yeah, making levels must suck, i've decided to only have one board game round
 OrangoMango#0973: im on 60% maybe
 GuyWithTime#7852: hell yeah
 blarphblublub#9702: all the best man, hope you finish by the end!
 Aledrite#4274: for me it's like 15% because I have levels to do.
 MrRedShark77#2280: use search me in 
 Frozen#7676: make sure to add dead kids to add to the originality
 kylejramstad#0205: haven't been here since yesterday and several people mentioned tetris... oops
 Hederlunden#3231: same (only like 30% done)
 Taccos#1054: same
 Aledrite#4274: barely done with the gameplay loop D:
 Roof#6985: Trello is awesome, millanote too
 blarphblublub#9702: yo can you link the message then? would love to see what you did
 Hederlunden#3231: Only 26 hours left
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: i made a Trello account last night and i havent even used it
 MrRedShark77#2280: why you ignore my development in ? please be honest to support by thanks :(
that's why i like every development
 blarphblublub#9702: you're just giving million dollar ideas away!
 LambdaPyro#6782: Add me on discord, im going to do a thinking shower to get my day started lol
 Frozen#7676: make the game a indie horror where you play a unfinished game
 OrangoMango#0973: hidden sites that redirects to itch lol
 Shroomax#3378: and i think learning xna would be good for me since i want to get more experience in coding
 GuyWithTime#7852: omg no what is that never heard of it
 Ber#3410: well its not all bad i did get an image of an important code
 Augs#3262: I don't feel like my game is 50% done though....
 OrangoMango#0973: did you know about this? gmtkgamejam.com/
 blarphblublub#9702: yikes, and I thought getting into NFTs was the worst thing a company could do
 GuyWithTime#7852: oof ;-;
 Parallax#4821: if you are comfortable with 3d and looking for an artist, i would love to join
 Pygocentrus#8974: I just started learning how to make a game on unity sad they are going downhill
 LambdaPyro#6782: My plan toda is to just not sleep and get everything done, its like college lol
 Ber#3410: i closed scratch on accident and nothing saved
 GuyWithTime#7852: Idk why but it reminds me of thomas was alone
 LambdaPyro#6782: Yup, then i had to start from scratch
 Ber#3410: shit
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: oml yes, especialy after unity bought/merged with ironsource
 Shroomax#3378: like they partnered with a malware spreading company'
 Parallax#4821: did you start the jam?
 MrBen#0001: I am amazed how it progressed
 jonahhw#9743: they're *really* going downhill lately, so it's a good idea if you're using it to pay attention to the direction the company's going and be ready to bail
 TheChronicPhenix#1205: It's sad the way Unity is going
 Astral#7476: Yeah I think we wont submit in time
 LambdaPyro#6782: Im a solo dev without art skills if you still want to do the jam, fair warning i am struggling a bit with choosing an idea thats within scope lol
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: i mean, unity can be very, very stressful sometimes
 Shroomax#3378: no it's not bad as a engine, it's just the company is completely throwing its rep away
 Pygocentrus#8974: I like unity it is a good software
 GuyWithTime#7852: Happy to hear that from a lot of people! :D
 blarphblublub#9702: is unity that bad?
 Parallax#4821: just 3d modelling
 Shroomax#3378: i think i am gonna learn xna (monogame) after this jam.  i am gonna switch from unity after all this fuss
 FireSquid#8882: awesome
 LambdaPyro#6782: Whats your skillset?
 blarphblublub#9702: oh i just saw yours in  it looks amazing!
 Chazi b#4006: Yes, anything except the game files
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: yea i am 😄
 Parallax#4821: i cant code for shit. I have no chance of finishing this jam. And its a shame, because the idea was pretty solid too
 GuyWithTime#7852: It does
 OrangoMango#0973: yeah I did pretty good
 SleepingRaven#0604: YEAAAAAAA DICE MECHANIC IS DONE :))
 FireSquid#8882: just to double check, I am allowed to update the itch.io page (stuff like icon, keyart, description, etc.) after the jam, correct?
 Ahnaf30e#3408: ye
 Shroomax#3378: not really, have to do a ton more, but still possible nevertheless
 Chazi b#4006: I'm further than I thought I would be, but still behind
 BadPiggy#5202: Yup
 MrBen#0001: my games looks so sick ngl
 blarphblublub#9702: dont let sleep stop you from making the best goddamn game of your life
 OrangoMango#0973: I need to make all the levels and some polish
 GuyWithTime#7852: Are y'all happy with what you got done in a day?
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: only a day and 2 hours to go lol
 LambdaPyro#6782: This is when i get the least sleep
 Hederlunden#3231: yeah, you can always look up how to do things online
 OrangoMango#0973: yeah sadly
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: yep, were officially 24 hours in 😄
 GuyWithTime#7852: ohhhhh
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: continue alone
don't let them stop YOUR progress
 Augs#3262: end of day 1
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: wot
no
you late
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: rip
 Scolon#4218: I'm working on polish atm, things are still going smoothly
 GuyWithTime#7852: It started like a day ago
 Ber#3410: ?? it started at 1:00 pm yesterday
 blarphblublub#9702: I meant I realized 5 mins ago
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: really good 🙂 im working on levels right now, got the first one done
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: unity developer report: unity crashed for 9999999th time
 Scolon#4218: no it didnt
 Ber#3410: no it didnt
 blarphblublub#9702: Lmao, i just realized this game jam started like 5 mins ago (I REALIZED 5 MINS AGO)
 Shroomax#3378: halftime indeed
 GavRaz#6261: halftime!!!!
 Parallax#4821: na. My programming knowedge extends to "hello world" thats it
 Shroomax#3378: that sucks
 TheChronicPhenix#1205: Ya love to see it, planning on continuing on anyway?
 borboss#7877: i gotta do menus, score, spawning, sounds, upgrades
and i think i have to redo my animation system cause i tried something new and it, did not owrk
 Parallax#4821: the programmer and the composer had a fight. So they both left
 iofractorg#6427: Relatable but you’ll probably work better by sleeping unless it’s the last few hours you have in which case it’s up to you
 TheChronicPhenix#1205: Ooooooph why?
 Parallax#4821: my team abandoned the jam an hour ago. T_T
 Ahnaf30e#3408: good night, but ye pretty good actually :D
 Astral#7476: I have so many unfinished stuff
 TheChronicPhenix#1205: Mornin friends, how is everyone getting along in their projects?
 Ahnaf30e#3408: i want to watch anime
 Astral#7476: I, geniually feel like I will pass out, haha
 Jeker#3389: i made a screenshake library
 redseiko#0001: I made an explosion particle systsem and my teammate said "oooh nice little dirt sparks when it hits the ground" 😐
 iofractorg#6427: I’m not tired and could be working but I know it’s not a good idea and yet here I am just staring at chat lol
 GameDude#3494: 1000 lines of code and still going. There is no stopping.
 Ahnaf30e#3408: also sound but uhhh ye idfk how to do that lol
 Astral#7476: I am sooooo tired
 iofractorg#6427: I probably should go to sleep though as it’s almost 3am and I just came here because I couldn’t sleep
 Ahnaf30e#3408: i just need to add scores and a "luck" meter bar thingy
 ryan123#4605: i just need to implement scorekeeping, ui and random obstacle spawning
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I mean that's their choice, you can ask in 
 iofractorg#6427: I will probably just work on the game on the remainder of the day and if I still have energy I might keep going
 Ber#3410: ok goodbye im leaving they're not willing to help because "they arent in the gamejam" 😃
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: submit what you already have and see how it goes
 iofractorg#6427: I’m considering giving up given that I have other stuff to do tomorrow but other me just wants to work on the game after I finish my other stuff and crunch throughout the night. Neither are good options but idk I just really want to submit a game or something
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: they absolutely can help, you don't have to register before hand this is 100% allowed.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: thats rough I'm sorry look in  you might find someone who can help
 hello there#4536: I wanna cry
 Ceding Tree#1081: coming up on that 24 hour mark!
 Ber#3410: im asking help from my friends who are smarter then me at scratch and they're saying they cant help because they arent in the gamejam 😃 i have 0 clue how to do the mechanic
 hello there#4536: our artist just decided to quit
 Admeliora#3682: ty ill put it there
 Jellogramming#4653: 
 ZedDev#4726: i just got a dumb idea for later. Imagine Ultrakill Ricoshot but with a dice
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I have told you multiple times. You may NOT use assets that you do not own. It doesn't matter how dressed she is you can't use this asset.
Secondly to this you may NOT include nudity in your game. A sexualised woman in underwear is not acceptable for this game jam.
End of discussion
 Admeliora#3682: Hi I am trying to rotate my 3D cube and it is harder than expected.
Are their any resourced that talk about rotating cubes with respect to their current rotation? Thank you for the help. ❤️
 Jellogramming#4653: I just have to make a boss fight and dice switching, and then I can focus on polish
 ZedDev#4726: yeah
 Chazi b#4006: Me too lol
 gamedevperson#8448: and finetune tomorrow?
 FryDev#0372: I'm making an endless game and i still overscoped
 ZedDev#4726: I literally have 2 things left, if i push it i might finish today
 Yollie#2239: That’s true lol
 gamedevperson#8448: i scoped mine down by alot in 1 day
 Delphine Noel#1196: I'm here since the starting of the jam and I've yet to do anything. I can't even think of something
 Chazi b#4006: It's not a gamejam without overscoping 🙂
 Yollie#2239: Yeah I think I overscoped slightly maybe
 theChief#0001: definitely not allowed.
 Jupiter_Butts#3521: why no one accept my 3d character model??? i get u guys dont accept nudes but my model is just bra and panties. is that still not allowed???
 Yollie#2239: Things I gotta do on day 2:
1) enemies
2) sfx
3) music
4) upgrades
5) menus
6) some kind of score
7) enemy spawning
8) more shells
 FryDev#0372: efficiency
 ZedDev#4726: You know what? Since i scrapped the random room idea, pathfinding is kinda useless so less time to waste on enemy AI
 Chazi b#4006: Woohoo! Congrats!
 Ahat#0842: ive got player movement! yay
 Bullseye8841#5517: me , yesterday: Okay, make a simple game!
me, now: I'm gonna need about $100,000 in crowdfunding to get this done...
 MrBen#0001: YES! IM DONE! ONLY SOME CAMERA SHAKES AND SOUNDS!
 ZedDev#4726: same
 Chazi b#4006: I totally agree, it's not a good game without some kind of good art, even if it's simplistic. But I'd rather have a bad looking game than a non-functional game with some cool art, so unfortunately I have to prioritize art last
 ZedDev#4726: just posted a progress clip
 Sherbert Lemon#8177: I saw someone do something with the logo animation last time and I thought it would look cool to give it a go, I could rip it from the announcement video if that is ok, but it would be preferable to have the source material
 Acu1000#5560: that's the main point
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: ahh ok
 iwonek101#1251: well even if i won't finish my game i learned something
 theChief#0001: the animation is not! We don't have an animation this jam
 Sherbert Lemon#8177: they only seem to have pngs on there
 hehe boi#3720: Art I pretty important too, but the programing makes the actual game
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I'm pretty sure they are all on the itch page
 Acu1000#5560: yep, breaks work wonders
 Zayn#4390: Alright. let's call that a day and go to sleep 🙂
 iwonek101#1251: wow... i took like a hour long break swam in a swimming pool and now everything starts to work...
 Zayn#4390: I'd say programming and art are both equally important
 davidnjihiahere#6326: if you can do it, I encourage you to finish the game. Even if it's just a game from a tutorial
 hehe boi#3720: Programming is the most important
 Sherbert Lemon#8177: does anyone have the gmtk logo animation?
 PepperTroopa#4091: proud of u for giving it a go at least! it was a good learning experience
 Chazi b#4006: Oh, I don't have any art yet, I meant I'm just now programming the dice part
 KaineShadory#1612: yeah immaa call it quits too and gonna head to bed... learned quite abit though, will try again
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: my bro is so helpful he just came in and said he will take care of my sis while our parents are home for today
 hehe boi#3720: Some people have started with the most pointless thing to start with and now they're actually adding gameplay
 Zayn#4390: Alright guys alot of progress has been done today, time to get some sleep
 Mukhavertolet#2243: why coroutines are so weird tho
 theChief#0001: this is pretty much the standard game jam experience 😉 you'll get there 🙂
 just_plenesar#1999: i dont even complete the art
 Mukhavertolet#2243: thanks
 KaineShadory#1612: welp defo not cut out for this, nothing's working lul
 just_plenesar#1999: congars 
 PepperTroopa#4091: I think I might have to call it quits.. I'm not sure if I'm properly equipped to do a 48 hour solo project just yet... I just gotta hone my craft and give it a go next year
 Chazi b#4006: 24 hours in and I'm just now making the actual dice, oh boy
 Viatrix#3575: i wanted to make my game board-game influenced but i couldn't figure out how to make mine an. actually fun board game
 Mukhavertolet#2243: YEEEES IT WORKS
 just_plenesar#1999: i think i would be back to the game
 davidnjihiahere#6326: greetings
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: hey chat
 Chazi b#4006: The theme ended up being something to enable my main mechanism if that makes any sense. So not super centered around it
 skonn dinasir#9002: im using shapes and stock photos
 belzimbub#1594: I am going to sleep and that means I will have less than 15 hours to complete a game at max
I did not start programming yet but have a clear vision
RNJesus save my soul
 hehe boi#3720: I have had the longest day and I'm dying to sleep rn yet it is 6 in the afternoon
 Amelia-chan#4996: imagine having more than 4 hours of sleep
 Snory#4231: huh, just finished the main concept and it is god damn boring.., but it sounded interesting in my head
 Cyndaquil#2646: No bragging please
 iofractorg#6427: I’m gonna do a completely unplayable mess lol
 belzimbub#1594: Well, I took an interesting way with it) still close enough
 Ahat#0842: im doing a demo
 iofractorg#6427: also barely done anything and have to do other stuff tomorrow so I’m probably not going to get a proper game done
 Pygocentrus#8974: I slept great
 Cyndaquil#2646: Its what keeps grown man up at night😂
 iofractorg#6427: meanwhile I’m trying to sleep but can’t lol
 Mono#7785: yeah, same lol
 dardasaba#9759: Same xD
 Ahat#0842: i barely slept, my mind was just thinking about this jam
 Acu1000#5560: this year's theme is pretty specific
 dardasaba#9759: Mine's main gameplay thingy is rotating a die, so... A lot? And also the projectiles are spawned every 1-6 seconds
 Ahat#0842: i wonder if its gonna be possible
 Trianull#5928: man.. I'm just not feeling it this time around
half the time is nearly up and I don't have anything other than a very loose concept in my head
 Ahat#0842: i dont have much done in my game rn, only have the logo, and my main character, along with some tiles. today im gonna be making more tiles, npcs, and the first/only level
 Making Dragons (Hassan)#7112: hi
 Ahat#0842: hello
 Adam#9346: Everyone knows rhythm games sell!
 birdstone#3073: dw lol
 Amelia-chan#4996: not really sorry
 Dragonite#5414: How much are your guys games centered towards the theme?
 Tornado#0975: MY artist havent came online
 birdstone#3073: lmao not really
does "aminus" help you remember?
 Shimp#0064: someday i should learn how to properly use sounds in unity, rn i got a dumpfire on my project with how many bandaids it got already
 Amelia-chan#4996: would it upset you if I said I don't remember you
 birdstone#3073: OH HEY i remember you from last year
 ZedDev#4726: I wonder what's the next game that will blow up for no reason like Among Us
 Shimp#0064: same
 Dragonite#5414: Almost completed my prototype let’s gooo
 Yollie#2239: its really crazy how much simple screen shake can add to a games feel
 Mono#7785: 😌
 ZedDev#4726: I'm running the game at 140 fps in editor with post processing, now i hope it won't break when i add the enemies AI
 Amelia-chan#4996: nah you have another hour, then you can panic
 GeoStarGames#8750: my eyes hurt.
 Snory#4231: ok, here is a deal, i am going to send you my game and you are going to the art phase 🙂
 FryDev#0372: top down perspective can be tricky
 Mono#7785: Halftime already *intense sweating*
 GavRaz#6261: like i didnt get the perspective right
 ZedDev#4726: I'll only use shapes cuz I'm bad at art
 FryDev#0372: what do you mean
 GavRaz#6261: having to remake sprites cus idk what topdown is :(
 ^_^#9116: great idea
you got this
 KadDev#8100: same, only I lack an actual factor to make the game fun
 ^_^#9116: send a vid in 
 MaryStrawberry#4672: it's a game
-Mark Brown
 BadPiggy#5202: I'm not even sure how to describe my game lol
 ^_^#9116: very cool
i think something like defeat  from meganeko and bossfight would fit it
just my opinion though
 ZedDev#4726: My game is named Dicey Game. Yeah, i wasn't inspired, i might change the name before submitting it
 ChopieTheCat#5876: Ty
 Ber#3410: do some songs need names
 theChief#0001: that exact style of music is on the way lol xD
 MrBen#0001: well I must admit: My game is one of the best looking 👀
 ChopieTheCat#5876: You game
 ^_^#9116:  if you dont have music i would suggest some technobeats. i think that would really fit the game and playstyle
 R4zorcl4w77#9100: danggg
 ZedDev#4726: God if Unity Recorder decides to not work, i won't be able to put videos of my game on my page
 Russian posh cat support ukraine#6575: wow nice we havent done anything :|
 MrBen#0001: I just slapped menu on some level from the game lol😜
 ZedDev#4726: I spend 3 hours working on the main menu, especially the volume sliders
 MrBen#0001: 15 levels. LETS GO BABY. I am dying
 ^_^#9116: nice job
 Beeg scarf#3571: Dude i only got a platformer of a dice that rolls whats do i do dog
 davidnjihiahere#6326: wow, my game is really broken
 ZedDev#4726: any reason why 960x600 is the WebGL preferred resolution?
 Zayn#4390: but luckily my game hasnt gotten corrupt yet, better make a backup
 Klemp#9694: My game is coming together well. If only it was actually fun to play
 ChrisDBrown#0127: Wasting far too much time trying to get GMS2 to scale up the game 😢
 MrBen#0001: YES I AM NEARLY DONE 
 Zayn#4390: :;(
 MCCV#1542: that is very unfortunate, that is why you use versioning!
 ZedDev#4726: I might actually continue working on this game even after the jam
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: here comes the worst part of making a shmup. Designing the enemy scenes.
 Zayn#4390: my friend almost finished his game for the jam, but unity is such a piece of crap that it legit corrupted his entire fking game, and now he uninstalled unity
 Zayn#4390: ok
 ^_^#9116: the normal one is imo better (just a bit tho)
 vide0gamer#5404: I've got the dice functions working, now I have to get the player to shoot and add enemies
 ZedDev#4726: so i have until tomorrow to add enemies and some player upgrades and I'm golden
 GavRaz#6261: my game ripping off hotline miami so much i like to call it diceline ~~detroit~~
 davidnjihiahere#6326: thanks for the advice
 wyrm_slayr#7477: Both sound fine, I guess the speed should depend on how fast paced your game is
 MrBen#0001: wow. just wow. I finished my game. Now I only need to add some camera shakes and more sounds and I'm done :D
 JuliusCube#8501: a nonbroken game that feels good is obviously ideal, but id say a broken game that feels good is better.
 davidnjihiahere#6326: free movement comes with the consequence of breaking things
 davidnjihiahere#6326: I'm on that conundrum. Trying to fix things
 Ber#3410: please
 Danny Dan Dan#6699: Man now I'm actually thinking of pivoting to this. I've already got controls for rolling a cube around, all I'd have to do is make the grid for the notes to fly in
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: sounds like you are having a fun time then!
 JuliusCube#8501: is there that big of a need for alphas prealphas and betas and that stuff for bigger teams?
 Ber#3410: both
some games can still work but still be broken
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: lmao
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Keeping everyone busy has been keeping me busy. Lmao.
 ^_^#9116: broken game
 Ceding Tree#1081: a broken game that feels broken
 Ber#3410: go to  to vote on what music i should use sped up or slowed down
 davidnjihiahere#6326: so what is better, a broken game that feels good or a game that feels eh without being broken?
Hopefully. Lol.
 ^_^#9116: ah hello
 Rav#3300: Based on 3 things, I don't remember which, they're on the itch page
Yes
Nobody will watch your trailer
 Ceding Tree#1081: Trying to stay simple, so far got a menu screen, a battle mechanic that works, and im throwing together a little shop to reward for the battles
 MrRoboman#9804: I'm going it alone, too. It is a mountain of work.
 ^_^#9116: lmfao
 Ceding Tree#1081: My first jam also, just me 😄
 Vélimir#3641: 7 ppl here! it's my first jam, is it the norm?
 davidnjihiahere#6326: hi
 ^_^#9116: keep it up lad
you can do it, i believe in you
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: How's your team managment going?
 Ceding Tree#1081: 11 people??? I'm just a lonely dev :'(((
 JuliusCube#8501: for no real specific reason, how is progress coming along with an 11 person team?
 Ceding Tree#1081: Thats ok, you can start now! Just try to stick with something simple since time is limited
 JJfriends#3686: i saw u last year lmao
 Silent Hill#1860: I haven't even start 😦
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Yeah! That son of a bitch! You know him?
 Silent Hill#1860: Hi,
 Ber#3410: i hate working alone its rare some of my games are really good for an alone dev
 Scolon#4218: You can never be too prepared for these things
 JJfriends#3686: the muffin man who lives on drury lane
 Ber#3410: 😭 i still dont have the actual mechanic
 MrRoboman#9804: Good morning! I thought the solutions to my design problems would come to me in my dreams. Unfortunately not. But I do feel ready to seize the day!
 Ceding Tree#1081: 25 hours left.....no pressure! lol
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: ...The Muffin Man?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: you can try some of the pinned resources
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Does anyone here know...
 PepperTroopa#4091: starting to realize that i probably should have practiced more gamemaker stuff before this jam. I'm kinda stuck because I don't know how to do a sequence of text/events so I just kinda have a nice mockup lol....
 Scolon#4218: I already have a lot of backstory too
 Ber#3410: i have 0 clue what paper toss is
 Penguinmanereikel#3708: Does anyone have the very cheap sounding stock sfx for a small audience clapping? The kind that you would hear when beating your high score in Paper Toss
 Adam#9346: No steal, it's a gift! If someone uses it just say "special thanks to some dude on discord"
 MrBen#0001: I already did 😜
 JJfriends#3686: You know what I'm going to put lore in my game. Make it a whole ass story game
 MrBen#0001: rate my menu in 
 Adam#9346:  I miss understood. "Face down doom" "Vanishing Ivory Tower" and "No luck, Just skillz"
 Scolon#4218: Oh you just reminded me I do need to add music at some point...
I'll probably do that tomorrow morning
 Wheatley#9235: i want to make a game for this jam but i have no experience in pixel art and composing
 OtherGuy80#6712: my idea for my game is a game where you roll the dice and you get a boss that you have to defeat
 Danny Dan Dan#6699: The rhythm game idea sounds really cool! If I weren't doing my thing already I'd steal that
 davidnjihiahere#6326: dice rhythm sounds epic
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: when the jam time ends we can all play each other's games and rate them. At the end of the week Mark will play the top 100 games
 Adam#9346: Ideas I won't use: 1. person inside of dice has to communicate with person rolling dice using signaling you choose. NPC rolling tells player the number they need with the special signal, and player has to hamsterball roll to the right number. Casino Setting, money as points.
2. Dice rhythm game. If you have to choose the right side to flip to, rolling forward, to the beat. Maybe add a second dice and you have to do math in rhythm
 Pobbie#9654: There will be a submissions page where you can scroll through thumbnails for all the games, play them, and rate them
 Taccos#1054: how do we rate them?
after the jam is over do we get to play them?
if so i better make an epic trailer.
how i dont have to worry since my game has wallrunning so it is automatically going to win
 KadDev#8100: it is better than dictris lol
 Wheatley#9235: yay
 dardasaba#9759: Program in a language like python and you won't need to put ; at all ;)
 Rav#3300: Us I think?
 KadDev#8100: ik, but just for clarification
 Ber#3410: better then dictris-
ill use this
 wyrm_slayr#7477: Dude, I've been to the point where I've been coding so long I started **ending my sentences with ;**
 Wheatley#9235: me
 Taccos#1054: btw who is voting the games?
 Rav#3300: ...Did you read the message?
 KadDev#8100: dis - tris like this
 Ber#3410: THATS WHAT I WAS THINKING ALSO LOL
 OtherGuy80#6712: how is everyone's game going
 Wheatley#9235: tetrice
 Rav#3300: Imma be real with you, that sounds like "dick" or like an illness if you pronounce it like "dice" lol
 OtherGuy80#6712: hello
 Ber#3410: thats what im doing i was asking for a name
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: isn't that puyo-puyo
 Taccos#1054: maybe tetris but each block is dice and if two dice of the same number touch each other then they disappear?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: ok.... cool
 KadDev#8100: how about **"Dictris"**
 Rav#3300: *quietly listens*
 Ber#3410: ok
 Wheatley#9235: me too pls
 Adam#9346: Want some? I've decided to work on my game that's almost to store instead of the jam, but I thought of some ideas I won't need
 wyrm_slayr#7477: How about: "Tetris *with* **Dice**"
 Rav#3300: Hell yea
 KadDev#8100: I hope that when I dream tonight, it's a dream about me playing an amazing, polished game similar to the game I am creating now, so that I can completely copy it, and credit my mind
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: same
 Ber#3410: i have 0 ideas for the name of my game
its tetris but dice
 MassedUp#8420: ima take a few mins break then get to work on basically 99% of the game
 SpeedWolfy#3389: I mean Unity is very cool tool to have, even when the jam is over
 davidnjihiahere#6326: I was looking for a game engine before the debacle. I'm going with unreal for the benefits after the jam. Sorry for the mistag
 Taccos#1054: man im acing progress
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: I fixed my dice always landing on the number 2 🙂
 Scolon#4218: Yes
 Ber#3410: what
 MCCV#1542: happy bday
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Welp my last hours here. Tonight going out eating and tommorow i'm off cus bday. Was super fun today to play and review so many games (17 in total) I had a great time here and wish you all good luck this last 24 hours! I'm hoping to enjoy many games when rating period starts.
 SpeedWolfy#3389: There is no wrong time to dis
 Ber#3410: should i learn unity after this is over?
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: Me when while lucid dreaming: Wehee i can fly !!!!
I do some brain storming wit my sleep paralesis demon
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: chill out, they are tools as I said they have a time and a place. They aren't good or bad
 Jupiter_Butts#3521: so you did use it? ITS GOOD AGREE?? man... this isnt fair. use singleton, u guys
 Astrallion#3773: 24 hours left? Oh no
 FryDev#0372: alright, time to finally get down to work
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: that's irrelevant. The first rule of the server is "don't be a dick"
 Scolon#4218: singletons aren't inherently bad. They're a tool and they have their place
 Jupiter_Butts#3521: except for attention grabber twitch streamer
 Penguinmanereikel#3708: Today, I’m gonna work on making menus and changing out my MS paint art with some pixel art
 Astrallion#3773: Left?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: singletons are just tools like everything else, there's a time and place for it
 Hederlunden#3231: it's the oldest trick in the book, nobody believes it (i think)
 MassedUp#8420: it might take a bit too long, we only got 24 hours
 Jupiter_Butts#3521: why programmers scolded me? 😦
they keep scolding me because i use singleton 😭  this people are mean
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Trying to troll people by telling them to press Alt+F4 etc is not funny. Its just sad and will get you a timeout.
 Zayn#4390: first for me 🙂
 Astrallion#3773: Trying to do rogue like level generation. First game jam!
 davidnjihiahere#6326: yeah
 MassedUp#8420: finally im done with the player movement
 Snage#1337: glorified roll20
 Karthik Krishna#7730: posted in game jam review pls give feed back
 ZedDev#4726: i need a new logo
 Hederlunden#3231: second day
 davidnjihiahere#6326: what if all everyone made is a dice rolling simulator
 Zayn#4390: Alright guys my games looking pretty good, and its only the first day 😮
 Danny Dan Dan#6699: I've been at it all morning and I feel like I'm getting nowhere
 Astral#7476: I am completly burned out at this point
 Snage#1337: 
 Danny Dan Dan#6699: Man, why is making a game so much work lol
 Karthik Krishna#7730: for feed back
 davidnjihiahere#6326: that's gamedev at the next level
 Zayn#4390: oh awesome, that sounds weird but someawesome
 Peewi#8572: 
 Snage#1337: bruh
 MCCV#1542: jalous
 Karthik Krishna#7730: can i post game play here
 Scolon#4218: I did a lot of brainstorming while dreaming last night
So I already know what I'm doing
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: 26h left - 8h of sleep and -4h of devertissement so 14h left to me
 Random Guy#5920: Yeah right
 Scolon#4218: 22 hours*
 Random Guy#5920: It's been like 24 hours since the jam started
 MCCV#1542: really?
 GuyWithTime#7852: :OOOO
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: i'd be more worried about missing the first ~40% of the jam
 Scolon#4218: Guys I have just woken up, it is time to dev
 Random Guy#5920: Cool good luck
 Zayn#4390: idk its honestly good
 Vovencio#1544: ye
 hungryroy#0352: "we" are "making" "game"
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: no we are two
 Random Guy#5920: You guys all making game for jam right?
 Peewi#8572: there are no experience requirements
 (유)니티 좋음/나찰 니티#7281: Yes you can
 Vovencio#1544: Am I the only one who doesn't find this year's theme all that exciting?
 Wheatley#9235: i started unity just 1 month ago can i still join the jam
 wyrm_slayr#7477: That's cool
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I'm not making a game, I'm just playtesting (and checking the review channel every so often) played a ton of amazing ideas today. Was awesome.
 oa#7680: if anyone wants a writer for plot and lore, dm me. i'm free now.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: That;s pretty much why,you don't have permission to use it. Your game will be disqualified for breaking the rules. End of discussion
 wyrm_slayr#7477: Epicly (knock on wood). How about you?
 CodingLord#1012: I am 5 hours in and there is no game
 oa#7680: tbh, i think i'm going to give up. my job is writing and gameplay. our programmers left, and idk how to code.
 davidnjihiahere#6326: doing nicely
 N8#2718: can you just like... not sexualize claire redfield and use a different model? mixamo has plenty of cool character models
 AJM-03#3713: Okay, thanks
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Hello you wonderful people. How's the game making going?
 Jupiter_Butts#3521: Oh.. even though people know that Claire redfield? Like she's really popular
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Both is the ideal but yeah I generally priorities webGL
 Lawn#1538: Like FMOD and Wwise.
 Lawn#1538: That's why middleware tools exist
 ZedDev#4726: God audio sliders are a pain, why isn't there a logarithmic slider by default for this?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: no but its clear and to the point
 MrBen#0001: ok Im working on main menu
 Merus#7019: this of course not being the only problem with the model from a rules perspective
 wyrm_slayr#7477: I'm just talking about the shape from a top-down perspective
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Well then your game will be disqualified. As I said you need to have the legal rights to the assets you use and no offence but I doubt you have that
 Amelia-chan#4996: yeah
 AJM-03#3713: Wouldn't webGL be better for the jam since more people can play it?
 CodingLord#1012: Late reply but, There would be thickness from surface to core in a flat earth I hope
 wyrm_slayr#7477: 🤮
Please at least put a warning in the page description
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: You can export it as webGL to play it in the itch browser but you can just make it a windows download if you want to. I would recommend both
 BadPiggy#5202: transform.forward = direction you want
 Merus#7019: you might be able to turn that into a superhero with a texture repaint?
 Merus#7019: gutsy to admit that they had a nude Claire Redfield model lying around such that it was the easiest thing to use
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Does anyone know how to face a direction in unity? I have a direction like (0, 1, 0) or (-1, 0, 1) but idk how to turn towards this position
 Jupiter_Butts#3521: I gave her panties only. Sorry, I need to have Claire redfield nude in this specific game. I hope itch.io really don't mind
 Wheatley#9235: guys can i use art from itch.io i cant find a 2d artist for the  jam
 vide0gamer#5404: Alright so I've still got to make shooting a thing, and code enemy's, and figure out everything else
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: You can use assets if you have the legal right to use them
 AJM-03#3713: Do you export it as WebGL from unity for it to be playable on itch?
 Lawn#1538: You can send images in 
 N8#2718: cant you just... put clothes on her???
 Tapu#9161: My game got a bug that has the probability of 1 out of 5832 and when it happens neither you nor you opponent can make any moves
 Saxophone Siphonophore#1485: Wait, can we not send images in this chat?
 Saxophone Siphonophore#1485: So the concept I went for in my game is that the player controls a sentient coin. Depending on which direction they face, good or bad stuff happens around them.
So far, I've implemented a cloud that rains in "bad luck" mode and an umbrella that opens also during "bad luck" mode 
The problem I have now is that I don't know how to further develop this, what other elements I could add, etc. Not to mention that, of my two implemented elements so far, the raincloud seems redundant. I had it knockback the player, but umbrellas can also block their path so they're doing the same thing.
 Jupiter_Butts#3521: Because I already have a claire redfield nude as my character model
 Amelia-chan#4996: yeah
 Peewi#8572: itch in general does allow nudity, it just has to be properly tagged
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: As far as I'm aware yes
 Jupiter_Butts#3521: Oh. Just asking sorry but does itch.io in general allow nudity?
 Merus#7019: unofficially, also no
 wumpus#3512: it was fun chatting, i now need to get to work on the most complicated feature of my game
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Officially no this jam does not allow that
 LightLeviathan#1443: oh my god lets go i finally control under control (*haha 100/10 pun lets go*)
 wyrm_slayr#7477: But if the earth was flat, would it be a rectangle or an ellipse?
 Ellis#1417: having to start again for the jam
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: its a model, but i think its center of mass is at 0,0,0 - I'll check
 Merus#7019: 
 wumpus#3512: huh? if its a model, it might be thicker on one of the bottoms - if its 2d, then 0 clue
 Wheatley#9235: i need a team for the jam
 Peewi#8572: nudity is not allowed. It's listed in the rules
 N8#2718: please no
 Jupiter_Butts#3521: Guys just wondering, does this game jam allow nudity? I will censor it or blue it during gameplay
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Its physics and I'm trying to find out which side is up, but when trying to rotate the dice to a cardinal direction, it always on a 2
 MrBen#0001: I'm taking a break from making a game
 wumpus#3512: sounds like your random function isnt working lmao
 Lawn#1538: That's fine, ask away.
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Bro my dice always lands on a 2!?
 Saxophone Siphonophore#1485: It's not a technical problem, it's a gameplay/concept problem.
 Lawn#1538: If it's about the jam rules and more general then ask here.
 Lawn#1538: Depends, if it's a technical problem then use 
 Saxophone Siphonophore#1485: Can I ask here for help here?
 CodingLord#1012: well yes, if you gonna be that precise then it would be an atmoscuboid but if you are that precise then our atmos"sphere" should be an atmos"ellipsoid"
 wyrm_slayr#7477: But doesn't a plane have a thickness of zero?
 wumpus#3512: the worst only happens at the one time you pray it doesnt lmao
 Redline#7370: so true
 WarmerMonster48#7413: I have seen a lot of cool ideas for this jam
 CodingLord#1012: huh why? the atmosplane would cover the flat earth from the top like a blanket
 N8#2718: ambient occlusion makes everything look better
 Lawn#1538: Friendly reminder to make a backup copy of your project somewhere in case the worst happens.
 MrRedShark77#2280: i going to have an idea of build card
 wyrm_slayr#7477: Wouldn't that be an atmoscylinder?
 CodingLord#1012: well maybe there is an atmosplane there
 Saxophone Siphonophore#1485: Which chat do I use in order to ask for help with game design? Cause I've hit a bit of a brick wall and  isn't quite it.
 wyrm_slayr#7477: But then there wouldn't be any atmosphere either...
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: rpg isn't working and I have to find new idea
 WarmerMonster48#7413: Neat
 Soup#3034: heres my to do list for my game
1. make shooting
2. improve d6 sprite
3. make d20 sprite
4. make enemy
5. make health
6. make levels
 Acu1000#5560: I'm 90% done with core gameplay
 Vélimir#3641: nah there's a theory that the sun is some kind of lamp shining only a part of the flat earth, so there still would be timezones
 dardasaba#9759: Just uploaded a (private) early version of my game, and everything works fine!
I did enough for today, tomorrow I'll make a tutorial, add different difficulty levels, and add as much particles as my browser build will allow me :D
 CodingLord#1012: I wish the earth was flat so there would be no timezones
 dardasaba#9759: Thanks, good night!
 adrenalyzed#5024: gn guys gl with ur projects
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: excellent. See if you can get your game uploaded and linked because then you'll feel like you've hit a good milestone that might help with the motivation
 CodingLord#1012: OHHH
 Vélimir#3641: ?
no I was just editing the same message, adding lines
 Balrajjjjjj#8760: imstalled a package and overwrote my scene 😦
 CodingLord#1012: Its 8:25 PM here and I am so sleepy, so no all nighter for me
 CodingLord#1012: how did you time so quick. That was the power of god
 Soup#3034: good morning everyone! i feel terrible as its about 8 right now and i went to bed at 3
 wumpus#3512: making a 3d game in an engine i dont use has been fun lmao
 Jasper#7906: I haven't really scoped, to be honest. That's to say, I have been working towards a minimal version of the game that is fun, and I have completed that. There's one main feature that I think should very much be in the game to make it work, but from there, I've got plenty of ideas I could add, but nothing I have decided on quite yet
 CodingLord#1012: Just take a break and do things you like and try to get excited for what you are going to do next in your game
 Tapu#9161: Remember there's still 28 hours left
 Vélimir#3641: hi people
 Pyth0n#0572: im going out for dinner tonight with my family so ive got that to look forward to
 Jasper#7906: Take a break. Have a shower, go for a walk, have something to eat, or something like that. And then come back and make that game. Imagine how awesome it'll be to have finished your game and work towards that
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: take a break. Get your game uploaded, talk a walk or have a rest
 RocketCow#5210: I have severely *underscoped* as an overcorrection to people telling me not to overscope, so now I'm almost done 😐
 CodingLord#1012: OK, I am writing my code now, wish me luck
 Jasper#7906: My todo list almost empty. But that's just because I only planned this far ahead...
 Pyth0n#0572: someone please help me, im losing motivation
 ^_^#9116: fix it or do the triple a thing and declare it as feature
 Tapu#9161: I should make a Todo list too
 arguingjaguar#5819: I have 4 game breaking bugs
 ^_^#9116: good job
 Zayn#4390: My Game is 45% Finished (according to my todo list)
 ^_^#9116: (forgot his/her name)
But thanks
 ^_^#9116: thats not from me but from ehhmm
someone else here
 belzimbub#1594: I see what you did there
 iwonek101#1251: yeah haha
 ^_^#9116: thats good
and remember
its all about having a dice time
 belzimbub#1594: I spent the entire day thinking about a game
And only now actually thinking about something good!
 ^_^#9116: every*
That prevents burnouts and is good for your health
 iwonek101#1251: i will probably make longer pause in like 15 minutes
 ^_^#9116: try to make 5 or 10 min pause after evry 30 min
 ^_^#9116: dont do it
its all about fun and learning and you can do it
 iwonek101#1251: same but after like 7 hours of working i am slowly starting to think of quitting
 R4zorcl4w77#9100: holy crap all the time
 Dexter of R’lyeh#5944: Anyone know of a pixel art editor akin to the one in GMS2, but not linked to it. Asesprite seems packed with more features and is more than I need.  Plus I just really like the GMS editor. It’s what I’m used to.
 CodingLord#1012: Glad to know there are others like me
 Code_Knight#6361: Hi everyone! This is my first jam. Been slow burn learning Unity over the past month. Not expecting to make anything groundbreaking, but I’m just here to learn and get a tiny project under my belt.
 oa#7680: i'm so annoyed at my programmer hes literally ghosting me aaa
 Dexter of R’lyeh#5944: Well, the design document is more of a thread on discord with clear formatting, but hey whatever works
 Dexter of R’lyeh#5944: I’m filling a lead role, so I’m doing a bit of everything EXCEPT music. So yeah.. also I’m a beginner at this and I don’t consider myself an artist. I’m in an odd position when I think about it lol. But I’m loving it honestly. I made the design document for the game for instance, and I set up all the autotiling and will likely be doing most of the arenas designs, we’ll see. I also made a couple art assets I’m really proud of and an interesting camera.
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: 71.4285714286% done !
 Danny Dan Dan#6699: Constantly. The worst though is when you realize the foolish thing you're doing is the right way lol
 DerpiestDude#2247: nice!
 Aiminer357#8033: congratulations!
 Pyth0n#0572: so ive realised that im actually going to finish my first game jam! = D
 CodingLord#1012: Have you ever got that feeling that "There must be a easier and smarter way to do this and what I am doing is foolish"?
 Redline#7370: nah I have lots of work to do
 Jasper#7906: Submitted. And I'd honestly be satisfied even if I did not have another half to improve upon my game 😎
 Pyth0n#0572: ITS F*ING UNLOADED
 MrBen#0001: too much time. I will just share screen
 Mr. Boss-inator#5208: Is it allowed to make a game that fits the criteria of two jams at once and submit it in both?
 Redline#7370: why don't just record -> go to a video compressor online -> compress video -> send video?
 DerpiestDude#2247: now to add guns to my cooking game
 MrBen#0001: I can show you some of the gameplay  . Can i vc u?
 Redline#7370: so true
 Aiminer357#8033: on one hand, having a team is nice. but on the other hand, if i just do only programming, i will get bored easily so at least i can work on art or other stuff
 MrBen#0001: you need to get to the dice in every level. In most of the levels its imposible to get to some places. thats why u roll a dice and random thing happens (ex. level flips, gravity changes, you clip through platforms, you freeze time...)
 Redline#7370: 10 because round numbers 😎
 oa#7680: my programmer has essentially given up. i'm considering switching to something much, much simpler and easier to make. idk whether i should or not.
 Zayn#4390: 5-10 is a good amount of levels for game jams. players just need to understand and enjoy the game.. and if you can make the first 2 levels feel good and juicy than you dont need to make more (if you dont have time)
 Karthik Krishna#7730: how many levels should we do
 Redline#7370: what's your game about, that you already made 15 levels?
 Dexter of R’lyeh#5944: The most difficult thing about participating in these jams is, by far, staying on task. I am constantly inclined to switch to a different task whether that be drawing a piece of concept art for my artist, or digging into code my programmer wrote. And I’m constantly failing to stop myself from filling that inclination.   I have to say I am LOVING the game I am making right now, despite the fact that the pixels seem to keep being jittery.
 MrBen#0001: YES! I COMPLETED ALL 15 LEVELS
 Zayn#4390: haha!
 Redline#7370: I'm back to living with the discord people
 Zayn#4390: redline welcome back
 Merus#7019: loving the assistance here
 Redline#7370: 
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: Same
 kr0tyara#6639: i made dungeon generation, really basic enemy ai and game cycle
 Karthik Krishna#7730: can we upload gamplay here for feed back
 Unclouded#9240: i have a spare idea for you
you are a security guard at a casino and you make sure no one is trying to rob the machines
 IcyPigs#1106: tbf we're 21 hours into jam...
 kr0tyara#6639: i'm like 25% done xdddd
 IcyPigs#1106: Same lol
 Aiminer357#8033: sorry
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: chill on the caps lock please
 Azurezero#4851: i hate that my best idea didnt pan out cause my other ideas are utterly boring
 belzimbub#1594: I DON'T HAVE MY LAPTOP ATM (it's a difficult situation, not going to explain it rn)
BUT NOW I WILL DO MORE THINKING
And it will be great@
 Taccos#1054: lol im like 50% done with my game
 Aiminer357#8033: NOW GO! CREATE IT
 Zayn#4390: congratulations
 belzimbub#1594: YES, I AM GETTING INSPIRATION
 MrCurt#0695: mb
 Peewi#8572: I guess it does sound like vector graphics. I'm looking to use this as a level editor. I guess levels is sometimes a kind of graphics.
 SaadTheGlad#9716: While people are pulling girls I'm pulling changes from github
 belzimbub#1594: Never give up!
 Minus#1843: sounds kinda like typical vector graphics, Inkscape for example 🤔
 |[ Fatal ]|#5771: aseprite crashing when i need it most \:(
 Peewi#8572: Does anyone know of a tool where I can draw 2D polygons and save the line defintions/vertex coordinates to a text file? Or would I have to make this myself?
 FryDev#0372: they would be very overworked
 wumpus#3512: every gamejam should have an official therapist lmao
 |[ Fatal ]|#5771: oh, same, i love my concept but i defo know its not good enough to be up there
 oa#7680: i'm going to work on the art now, brb
 wumpus#3512: same, it crashed on boot - i removed it off of itch out of shame
 FryDev#0372: well, this is a pretty nice channel I guess
 Freast#9278: last year I submitted a game that literally just didnt work lmao
 oa#7680: we have a worst case plan which is to move to a different engine like twine or use renpy
 Jasper#7906: both. either. the experience in general.
 Hederlunden#3231: i thought it was the stress and sleep deprivation we had along the way :)
 Aiminer357#8033: getting positive comments was definitely one of my favourite moments last jam
 KadDev#8100: last time I failed to submit, this year, I won't make the same mistake...
 FryDev#0372: I thought it was the game I made
 Jasper#7906: winning is the friends you make along the way all along
 SeanSS#0892: Hang in there brother
 Zayn#4390: Lol
 Aiminer357#8033: dont you just love when unity freezes and crashes
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: yes,i will be happy to see positive comment and be in top 5000 like last year
 oa#7680: i know. but we don't have much time free ever
 FryDev#0372: I’m certainly not gonna win the jam, but I’ll have fun trying
 wumpus#3512: atleast you have a game lmao
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: if i can give you any advice, it might be a good idea to try this kind of thing in a jam with more time - i think 7 day jams are excellent for this
 Zayn#4390: Im so hyped, even if I dont win the jam, I still like my game 😄
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: bro i take a bg for my game and i absolutly don"t know if it's copyright free or not so i remixed it in photoshop
 |[ Fatal ]|#5771: Thank u!
 oa#7680: am stressed, the person im with is using godot for the first time for this jam. we've all been meaning to learn how to make games for a while, and decided to join the jam to kinda give us the motivation.
 Tornado#0975: what do i do my artist havent come online
 belzimbub#1594: I believe in you!!!! Go go go!
 |[ Fatal ]|#5771: Think abt whether u could use the dice to determine random events in a game or whether it could be part of the gameplay itself, etc.
 Darigan#0716: I made a platformer with a dice player and dice enemies and said I was done. Just need to wait for godot export templates to finish compiling.
 Space#0859: HUH💀... i haven't even STARTED
 CC426#0243: It’s called Chip Challenge it’s just really short that’s all
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: I do 57.1428571429% of my game !
 Space#0859: I cant think of anything to do with this topic tbh
 |[ Fatal ]|#5771: Damnnnn, whts its name?
 SeanSS#0892: *lucky bastard*
 |[ Fatal ]|#5771: For some reason this yr all game jams i signed up for ended up on the days i am the most busy on... i am desperately trying to speedrun making art for my game
 belzimbub#1594: Damn :D
 MrBen#0001: send link
 CC426#0243: Just submitted my project!
 SeanSS#0892: Thus is the woes of a cdpr employee
 Aledrite#4274: hello
 belzimbub#1594: A lot of people are like this atm lmao
 Arfilish#8729: i don't know really
 Laugic ❄☃#0818: I've been switching between ASMR, space ambience, and my own music 😅
 |[ Fatal ]|#5771: The sound of my pc vibrating as it tries to function despite basically being on life support
 Hederlunden#3231: why asmr?
 Arfilish#8729: It's either VGM or eurobeat.
Or ASMR
 Laugic ❄☃#0818: Very nice both of you
 CodingLord#1012: I dont listen, I sing
 Aqua_Coder0010#2146: I forgor vectors
 Arfilish#8729: And the only gun model
 Laugic ❄☃#0818: what are people listening to while they jam? I am stuck
 wumpus#3512: im at my lowest moment right now lmao
 Arfilish#8729: I only have player movement and main menu
 Freast#9278: Im dead
like really dead
 SeanSS#0892: Im actually kinda relieved to see that I'm not the only one struggling here lmao
 Hederlunden#3231: ouch
 |[ Fatal ]|#5771: I only have an empty window with a title bar and a splash screen 👍
 CodingLord#1012: Oh thats nice, Good Luck !
 belzimbub#1594: Yeah, I think so?
Not for the gameplay and it's not great but making progress!
 p13_l0v3r#2262: Let’s go!!!
 dark prince of kisses#3874: starting to accept the fact that there's no way on earth I'm going to finish my spec in time so I'm just gonna go as far as my legs can take me
 Darigan#0716: Too hot to gamedev
 Ceding Tree#1081: Just woke up, time to get back at it! 26 hours left people, good luck!
 Prakhrr#1547: I haven't even thought what game would I be making
 CodingLord#1012: you got the idea, now?
 Zayed#7379: what? its true tho
 belzimbub#1594: Okay
I THINK I got the idea!
I'll go think about it, wish me luck!
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: Nice joke
 shuhai#8582: i only finshed a startpage
 Hederlunden#3231: and then i have a lot of other things to do like stupid animations, sound effects and music, tutorial, win and lose state, ugh
 SeanSS#0892: I may have to go regress to a more boring yet managable concept for my game
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: i had a lot of thing to my game
 Zayed#7379: yeah he probably rolled a six
 Hederlunden#3231: lucky.
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: i do 42% of my game
 SeanSS#0892: True
 Zayed#7379: idk
 ChipmunkDev#1808: and my concept isn't really that gud
 Redline#7370: yeah, but polishing a terrible game won't help that it's still terrible
 CodingLord#1012: I have not written a single line of code yet, I am just making and art and designing the game :(
 SeanSS#0892: But they have more chances to polish which is very important imo
 ChipmunkDev#1808: ugh i feel so far behind
 Redline#7370: that game would probably not be a very interesting game tbh
 Hederlunden#3231: might have to do a little trolling to my own health
 SeanSS#0892: *I envy you all who is finished with the game and is just bugfixing*
 Hederlunden#3231: my checklist for the gameplay is at a solid 27% on trello :(
 Zayn#4390: good luck man
 OrangoMango#0973: so many bugs to fix...
 Zayn#4390: you're right but Im not takin a break now lmao I got so much done
 dark prince of kisses#3874: and the w, s, and x keys of my keyboard are broken. I can only get them to register if I type the key to their left first 😩
 dark prince of kisses#3874: I'm still trying to figure out how to implement an auto-battler on 6 different faces of a cube
 SeanSS#0892: Aaaaaaaa that sounds like a can of bugs that I cant deal with in a day
 Hederlunden#3231: just use a* or unity navmesh
 belzimbub#1594: I hope you are proud of the work you hace done!
If you feel like you need some, it's better to take a break
I mean, I am not the game jam expert,
but health is important☝️
 SeanSS#0892: Yea Im thinking of changing my core mechanic
 Tapu#9161: My AI is just `floor(random(0,3))`
 Redline#7370: just don't make AI lol
 Salaro#3539: Really wanted to join the game jam this year but I work all 3 days
 Zayn#4390: Game's going good, but my mental health is going bad 🥲 my left arm is hurting because..
 Tapu#9161: I need enemies, art, animation, sound, juice
 MCCV#1542: same here man
 ProtoXV#2705: ✌️ My dumb ass really wanted to be all "proper" with the jump mechanics so I've spent a stupid amount of time wrestling with parabolas
 No_Namer007#8260: me
 Redline#7370: me but instead of level design I need enemies
 Danny Dan Dan#6699: 👋
 SeanSS#0892: Who here isnt done implementing all the mechanics and also needs to do level design 🖐️
 No_Namer007#8260: for some reason i keep humming among us drip while coding XD
 belzimbub#1594: Lmao x)
A beauty of game development)
 Taccos#1054: bruh my dumbass was confused as to why the enemies are not getting stunned when i realized that i didnt set the stun time so they got stunned and un-stunned on the same frame 💀
 FryDev#0372: welp, guess I gotta make the entire game today
 belzimbub#1594: Haha
What about you?
 Zayn#4390: 🥲
 keb#6637: don't worry just make sure that you have enough time to figure everything out before the submitting deadline
 belzimbub#1594: I have some
But I am skilled enough to do anything with them)
Which is nothing special, obv
I will think of smth
Even if it will be 5 hours before deadline :")
 Tyler Hunter#0474: Oh noes
 FryDev#0372: I’m pretty sure 1280x720 is a good resolution to have
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: i mean strictly yes it is upload a file and it's done, just whether that file actually runs is a quite different matter
 keb#6637: if you are doing this for the first time it could be a bit complicated.
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: there are a number of things that can trip you up, like mismatched viewport size and the compression in the html5 player settings
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: no, make sure you have everything working first
 keb#6637: my game will use 1024x600 (default godot aspect ratio)
 Tyler Hunter#0474: Is it easy to set that up on itch.imo?  Like upload a file easy?
 alchemyBats#4712: ok cool
 Delphine Noel#1196: I have a thousand ideas from the theme and all of them are pretty bad
 keb#6637: no?
 Tyler Hunter#0474: Oh crud I need to figure out unity browser implementation….
 Cxly#2812: my favourite part of my game is when the dice say "its rollin' time" and roll all over them
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: yeah we know from experience that without it the moment the jam ends every channel just gets rammed with 'review my game pls!'
 belzimbub#1594: Oh God :")
That's better than nothing)
 SeanSS#0892: I have now realized that I am an idiot and am now contemplating if I should change the scope of my project
 Redline#7370: morbius?
 BanananaMonke#3591: why haas  everyone the same game as me :(
 Cxly#2812: i just got an idea but it is so morbid ahahahah
 belzimbub#1594: Congrats!
 TheDepressedGamer#3341: I just got an amazing idea now\
 belzimbub#1594: Yeah, not perfect, I know x)
 Merus#7019: you have a day and a bit to find one
 alchemyBats#4712: Hello, my team was wondering if there's a specific aspect ratio for itch.io? This is our first game jam and we don't want to mess up ha ha!
 Zayn#4390: you will eventually find a idea lol
 keb#6637: do you still not have an idea for the game?
 belzimbub#1594: Hello everybody! I hope I am not the only one who has problems lmao
I just can't think of an idea :D
 Zayn#4390: Ok guys unity crashed, lets hope nothing got corrupt 🥲 🤞
 Merus#7019: this is our sixth rodeo
 Merus#7019: this isn't our first rodeo
 Zayn#4390: sorry I did not know there was a channel for that lmao
 Zayn#4390: alright thanks 🙂
 Hederlunden#3231: looks great but the background should have the same pixel size as the foreground
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: 
 Enzo Mendonça#2138: okay, thanks!
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: You can't say that based on the engine, it's what you make with it
 TheDepressedGamer#3341: finally I am developing my game
 Enzo Mendonça#2138: I'm making a scratch game, do you all think it's good enough?
 Mukhavertolet#2243: well then I better hurry up. cya
 Danny Dan Dan#6699: Smart. I might run out and get something too
 Acu1000#5560: 
 Hederlunden#3231: there are also 5000 players
 Tyler Hunter#0474: Are there channels to bump your game when you post it.  With 5000 games.  Getting anyone to play it might be a bit challenging.
 Acu1000#5560: take a shower and make sure to stay hydrated
 Danny Dan Dan#6699: For some reason I chose an idea which requires a decent bit of math to implement, and I don't have any coffee this morning...
 No_Namer007#8260: i need to make enemies puzzles and like half of the art (and particles duh)
 Acu1000#5560: 🇵🇱
 Enzo Mendonça#2138: guys
 Hederlunden#3231: luckily my game doesnt need a lot of polish
 Zayn#4390: I've got most of the gameplay done
 Mukhavertolet#2243: same
 No_Namer007#8260: i had to use like 8 hrs to sleep lol (in total)
 Hederlunden#3231: wow, I hadn't relalized, I still don't have the basic gameplay in place, and half the time has already passed, haha!
 Jasper#7906: In my case: very minimal graphics, a game with simple gameplay (to make, anyway) and prioritizing getting a fun first playable version above almost anything. So, yeah, not fast, just focused, I guess.
 JanbluTheDerg#1018: Lots of positivity!
 Redline#7370: I finally stopped streaming so I can actually be here and exist
Welp, back to working, I'd like to get the game done today so that I have the last day for polish, playtesting and juice
 Zayn#4390: 🤣 🤣 🤣
 39#6748: man i didnt expect a puzzle game to be so annoying to make
 ertu#9255: and I finally start making gameplay 😂
 Klemp#9694: i still need to work out the kinks of my game so that it's actually fun
 Zayn#4390: Getting closer the the deadline 😳
 Mukhavertolet#2243: am i really slow or you all are really fast? i'm still making basic gameplay
 Jasper#7906: Wooohooo, I reached what I consider the MVP for my game. Not a great game, and still missing some of the components that make this idea, but it's playable and it's actually sort of fun.
 Ahnaf30e#3408: for example, a fist that when it hits the ground, it explodes (dat epic explosion too)
 Ahnaf30e#3408: mine is related to multiple levels of absolutely meme-ish enemies
 Tapu#9161: Make the dice go into a goal post but only if it lands a 1
 Taccos#1054: i have the main feature of the game working perfect now i am adding on it.
the feature is related to multiple powers so i am currently making powers
 Karto#7782: i still dont have a single gameplay idea. I have a dice kicking mechanic but no clue what to do with it
 Pyth0n#0572: finally squashed my first bug
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Always check the license of any assets you use. You may be required to be certain text into your game files
 Ahnaf30e#3408: i am excitingly procrastinating
 Ahnaf30e#3408: How ya guys doin?
 TheKillerChicken#1725: Stretching the infinite team limit rule :v
 Tapu#9161: If it's public domain then you don't need to. But most other licenses require you to share the creator's name or something
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I left mine unfinished because the game is unfinished.
 Mavelan#6612: Do I have to share a link to the website from which I have downloaded the music for my game? I have it in my assets from another of my games and I remember it was royalty free but I can't find the website
 Snage#1337: if(Game == notFinished)
{
finishGame;
}
 MassedUp#8420: im gonna decide my game plans using dice
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: if(Game == notFinished) { }
 Tapu#9161: Got bored studying the entire morning, so I started something
Hbu?
 wyrm_slayr#7477: if(Game.notFinished) {
Game.Finish;
}
 adrenalyzed#5024: man you shoulda told me that 12 hours ago
 Tapu#9161: Hi, how's your team doing?
 Hederlunden#3231: not with that attitude. you could just code the game to finish itself :/
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Hi
 adrenalyzed#5024: that game isnt gonna finish itself
 Mukhavertolet#2243: i'm still grieving
 wyrm_slayr#7477: Hello
 TheDepressedGamer#3341: Hi guys
 Snage#1337: dont think you can finish with 30hrs left?
 adrenalyzed#5024: when that happens you go through the 5 stages of grief in like 1 minute and then u forget about it
 Russian posh cat support ukraine#6575: same
 SparkerXof#3127: Now I'm afraid I haven't enough time to complete the game.
 Mukhavertolet#2243: what if it works only when messy
 39#6748: can absolutely relate
 adrenalyzed#5024: if your project is messy just spend around 10-30 mins organising everything, it makes everything faster in the long run
 Chal#6423: and im gonna make it a horror game yaaaaaaay
 KadDev#8100: I think I am gonna make it all in black and white, because it's easier and fits the dice theme
 Chal#6423: game development is weirdly hard
 Hederlunden#3231: same, im coming up with the stupidest and laziest solutions to my problems when in reality i couldve probably just changed a number somewhere lmao
 wyrm_slayr#7477: Same
 Tapu#9161: My code feels like a cat walked over my keyboard
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Yeah, can't overstate the importance of good branding, might be worth taking half an hour out to make sure it looks nice and pretty
 Chal#6423: aight, gonna make it as simple as possible
 Hederlunden#3231: just make a good thumbnail and lots of people will play it
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: take it to  please!
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Itch has a random rating queue so everyone's game will be seen by the same amount of people at first
 SparkerXof#3127: My artist can't draw sprites anymore. Now I need to make them myself. ;-;
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: ayo !
 Catfish#2063: hii
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: There's no way to tell that
 adrenalyzed#5024: ur game will be played it just depends on the recommendations and how good your game is ig
 Chal#6423: or will it just be played by a low amount of people?
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: thank
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: exactly, get something up and then no matter what you have something done
 Chal#6423: so will our games be played by alot of people once the game jam ends?
 adrenalyzed#5024: theres an option in the user settings for that
 Acu1000#5560: Settings -> Windows Settings (if youre on windows)
 aridai#3842: good idea
i'll wrap up the first level at least
the remaining mechanics will come in if i have time for them
 Acu1000#5560: just keep going, try to do as much as you can
 qxt2019#6669: i dont thik i can finish in time
 Chal#6423: Yea breaks are really important when your doing something really productive
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: scale it down, finish up whatever you are directly working on and then export it, get it on itch and link it to the jam. That way you have something done
 Alai#0673: how to setting so that discord opened when i start my laptop?
 Acu1000#5560: Take a break every hour to not get burnt out
 wyrm_slayr#7477: Dang, that's some mixed results Lol
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: I really got over this phase
It was yesterday when I didn't had a good idea
now i'm okay
 Chal#6423: oh when exporting a project to an apk you will see something at the bottom which says "export with debug" then uncheck that to do that
 Snake95991#6766: ok, will do. Thank you!
 dQw4w9WgXcQ#8475: my heads killing me already its not gonna be a fun day
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: when you click to export there's a button that asks if you want to include debug
 aridai#3842: ghhhhhh
what do i do if i know i won't finish on time
 BrokenCalculator#2386: k i've finished the main art, progress is looking good. gonna take a break and play some GW
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: like stuff that were made for that other game that are not general. Check the itch page to be sure there is a place it says
 Snake95991#6766: Good, but it's going to be a LONG night...
 Alai#0673: i just completed day 1 cuz i live at asia
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: Guys,how can i export my godot game without debug ?
 krisis in a jar#0904: SAME MY HAND HURTS SO BAD
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: wot
 Snake95991#6766: Just so that I can be sure, what would be too much in depth?
 Tornado#0975: I AM EXHAUSTED BEEN WORKING FOR 7 HOURS STRAIGHT
 dQw4w9WgXcQ#8475: 😭
 Chal#6423: pretty good, just finished my game
 adrenalyzed#5024: bug fixing
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: day 1.5
 wyrm_slayr#7477: Hello all, how goes day 2 of the jam?
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: movement or general art? no
more in depth stuff? yes
 Alai#0673: nope
 Chal#6423: will i be disqualified if i re use pre existing assets from my other projects for my game?
 Chopper#3119: hahaha no worries
 krisis in a jar#0904: forgot that word existed 💀
 Chal#6423: well damn
 Chopper#3119: yearly
 krisis in a jar#0904: one time every year
 No_Namer007#8260: im doing my project in scratch as a challenge
 Chal#6423: how often does gmtk does game jams?
 KokoBird#9800: ahh i forgot how bad i was at coding haha. Won't be contributing this year for GMTK- but I'll practice coding in preparation for next year! Good luck everyone with your games! I look forward to playing em :D
 MrBen#0001: oof
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Ben can you not randomly ping people asking for help with your game, it's pretty inconsiderate - this is something probably better taken to  or  anyway
 adrenalyzed#5024: ty
 OrangeKingdom#9769: What puzzel
 Toboter#5206: Freesound.org
 Taccos#1054: aight my main game mechanic is fully working
 adrenalyzed#5024: does anyone know a good place to find ambient sounds / make them
 qxt2019#6669: just created the new project
 MrBen#0001: can u help me with a puzzle? You will have fresh mind 
 MrBen#0001: yeah they r just cubes
 OrangeKingdom#9769: Wow, some people already finished
Btw  are you using your own assets
 farkon00#0500: One of the main things in the game jam is sleeping well or at least not that bad to feel tired
 Alai#0673: i just born 1 second ago
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I'm making a game with dice in it.
 MrBen#0001: yeah we know
 OrangeKingdom#9769: Great, I am making a knigh game
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I am 94
 OrangeKingdom#9769: It's just a plattformer game
Btw I am 14
 MrBen#0001: wo
 OrangeKingdom#9769: Just finish the movement
 Alai#0673: i guess i'll continue this game tomorrow cuz i've working on the gamejam game for like 14 hours and i'm so tired 🙂
 MrBen#0001: Please DM me to help me with a puzzle
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Sounds awesome! Take your time :) I just went through all of the games in the  and outside of the one game I can't play (cus it was for apple) I only had one game which I can't play cus it keeps shutting off.
 MrRedShark77#2280: i hate somebody ignoring me in  :( or doesn't react
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: now I have to take a break
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: ~~*I prefer a hispanic player, but I guess that's cool too.*~~
 FelaKuti#1312: oh wait this server really do be only for patreons
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: finally all my ghost arts are finished, time to make rpg battle and catch system, radar and ghost hiding locations.
 theChief#0001: I'll have something to test soon! Just working on the game director to sort out enemy spawning in a bit more of a considered way, rather than just "here have a bunch of enemies" every now and then xD going to do an intensity curve and spawn things based on that, so I can control the pacing a little better
 MrBen#0001: yeah white player looks good
 MrBen#0001: bloom is file
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: :D The game i'm playing atm marks my 15th game I'm reviewing/playtesting today
 theChief#0001: Neon is love, neon is life
 MrBen#0001: they blend too much to the environemtn I think but I will try
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: awesome good luck with it I like the neon
 Mukhavertolet#2243: i would try white or light grey
 BrokenCalculator#2386: try white or gray
 MrBen#0001: yeah but idk what color to make it
 theChief#0001: Link to progress pic
 Mukhavertolet#2243: looks great but shouldn't a player be bit more noticeable?
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Loot to shoot
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: All these great games. Can't wait to play them.
 theChief#0001: My main issue is going to be getting enough enemies done. I don't think I'm going to be able to do a boss, I've got some tax stuff I need to get on with too 
In theory I've got a friend working on making a ton of loot, we should have a bunch of variety 😁
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Later on today, tho. We'll have much to show.
 MrBen#0001: thxxxx
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: madness
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Ohhh can't wait!
 theChief#0001: ... yes really 😂 tbh the core is done, I've got a top down rhythm looter shooter, just doing the whole roguelike bit now!
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Our game isnt ready to show yet.
 theChief#0001: Yours looks great!
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: yeah i'm just remaking destiny 2 but with more dice
 MrBen#0001: gg
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: like.... really orrrrr..... o_o
 theChief#0001: Done 😂
 Chazi b#4006: Mines an arena battler where after each wave a die roll applies a buff to both you and the enemies
 yugioh#7402: I'm excited to check them out tbh
 quantum#0043: 3d fps
 MrBen#0001: (send pics)
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Our game is also top-down. Lol.
 theChief#0001: I'm doing a top down rhythm roguelike looter shooter 😂
 Zoro5168#0115: Roll of life: an RPNG adventure
 yugioh#7402: That's a good one i will give you that
 DK Devloper#6354: i am making a top down 3d game
 theChief#0001: Beat blaster is probably the pick tbh
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Dungeons and Fraggins was what I had in mind. Lol.
 BrokenCalculator#2386: you have to defend a flag at the top of the mountain from enemies climbing from below by dropping dice on them which rolls down and hits them. whatever number the dice roll is how much damage you do
 theChief#0001: I'm tempted by "rolling thunder", "beat blaster" and "loot table"
 MrBen#0001: Im doing a platformer with shifting mechanics and gravity
 CFHM#9742: I've got my design laid out, but it's missing a *theme*. Anyone want to throw out sets of three things? ie "earth, wind, fire" or "sun, moon, stars" or "Larry, Moe, Curly" or "Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle"
 DK Devloper#6354: nice dice
 Chazi b#4006: After all this time I'm almost to the point where I'll code up the actual dice mechanic, deeling a bit behind but I think I'll still be able to submit something playable
 Zoro5168#0115: Board game
 yugioh#7402: What about dicing is cool
And dicing is cruel
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Twin stick shooter meets D&D.
 qxt2019#6669: Dice
 Zoro5168#0115: Mr king dice left me to die
 BrokenCalculator#2386: mvp is done, doing art, everything going suspiciously smooth
 MrBen#0001: What r ur games about btw?
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I wanted to call ours something cool. But, idk if we will all agree on it or not.
 GuyWithTime#7852: For now its the sides of the die but that might change
 Minus#1843: it is never too late, just do something a little bit smaller 😛
 qxt2019#6669: Havent even started
 yugioh#7402: It's non existent for me
 BrokenCalculator#2386: you still have quite alot of time, i think 30 hours
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i got mine, going for the arcade feels: super space dice blasters
 Hederlunden#3231: i got so much to code
 MrBen#0001: shifting (sth)
 MaryStrawberry#4672: how's everyone's games going?
 qxt2019#6669: Is it too late to join and finish in time ?
 yugioh#7402: That's tough hope it goes smoothly
As for me I'm gonna sleep in a bit
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: That's a cool name, ngl.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: me and mr king dice do not see eye to eye anymore after this jam.
 Hederlunden#3231: that's a banger
 JanbluTheDerg#1018: I don't have the time I wish I did to work on it, but the core mechanics work fairly well, so I just gotta make a level and boom! Minimum viable product!
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I'm just waking up. Much production to do today! How about you?
 BrokenCalculator#2386: are you a real game dev?
 BadPiggy#5202: Yup
 yugioh#7402: Hi shadow how's your day going
 Tapu#9161: I'm gonna go get some fresh air before studying
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Anyone got a game name, yet?
 Zoro5168#0115: Game idea- Time to roll
 yugioh#7402: I'm mr king dice I'm the gamest in the land
 MrBen#0001: man I did 12 levels
 JanbluTheDerg#1018: It's dicing time
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: GAME IDEA INSTEAD OF DYING YOU DICING
 BrokenCalculator#2386: GOD DAMMIT
 yugioh#7402: A dice working in a cemetery
 Zoro5168#0115: Roll of life my games name
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i found an idea that's in my wheel house and now it's just a question of executing it well enough in the time given
 Tapu#9161: What happens to this die 🎲? It dice
 BrokenCalculator#2386: it's not just you, every game dev is bad at naming
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: Anywhere the wind blows, nothing really matters
to meeeee
to meeeeeeeeeeeeee
*sweet piano*
 yugioh#7402: I need no sympathy
 Tapu#9161: I'm bad at naming, named my game "It dice"
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I hope everyone's game is going well!
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: I'm just a poor boy
easy go
easy come
 UniversalAsshole#4809: and there are free milkshakes for those who PFC every single chart in the game.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I just dropped a straight up banger in . 
 yugioh#7402: Oh sorry
 UniversalAsshole#4809: it's like stepmania, but dumbed down
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: is (turn them to the skies and see)
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: god now i'm actually gonna have to put up a queen album while working
 UniversalAsshole#4809: does anyone wanna playtest a lil VSRG im kinda working on?
 yugioh#7402: Open your eyes and see
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: no escape from reality...
 yugioh#7402: Caught in a landslide
 Maksu#4798: this is like that one GMTK jam where everyone made a shoot-to-move game
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Well I have to go do chores eugh. I'll be back later. Got two more games to playtest
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: ok
is this the real life?
is this just fantasy?
oh mama mia mama mia mama mia mama mia mama mia let me go
so you thing you can 
it's bohemian raphsody
 BadPiggy#5202: Well that sounds better than my idea lol.
I'll be posting in a few mins in the progress channel lol
 CrashCubeZeroOne#0715: but it's against the rules
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: the theme: roll of the dice
most people: dice character
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Helloo!
 CFHM#9742: If anyone is still looking for a game idea - Mark Brown + Maui fighting game.
.... and their boxing gloves are dice. So it fits the theme.
 CrashCubeZeroOne#0715: have a great day 2
 Minus#1843: PARTY, that's what you started, now join us!
 CrashCubeZeroOne#0715: gm everyone
 CFHM#9742: It's adorable! Well, it's nice to see that humans never change 😉
 Minus#1843: You don't even know how you feel :>
 BadPiggy#5202: Open your eyes
 CFHM#9742: You're face to face with greatness, and it's strange
 iofractorg#6427: I'm debating whether to get a team to help me because of how far behind schedule I am but I kinda wanted to do it solo
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: What's happening here?
 CFHM#9742: I can see what's happening here >_>
 Minus#1843: If you submit it and you learned anything new during this jam - you are still ahead, jams are perfect way to quickly hone your skills!
 iofractorg#6427: I did try to do a lot of planning on my phone while I was away though so that's a plus
 iofractorg#6427: yeah ok I'll try to submit it
I probably could have done far more if I wasn't too busy having to do other stuff and came up with an idea earlier
and I'll probably also have to do other stuff tomorrow :/
 Minus#1843:  thanks for idea, but will stick to animator this jam, mostly cause I don't really have time to learn anything new and rewrite bunch of stuff 😄
 Minus#1843: do as much as you can and submit whatever you have at the end, everyone here is also doing their best, we're all going to understand that sometimes you cannot finish your idea, so there's no problem with sending something unfinished, as long as it is able to run on Windows or in web and can be "played"
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: If people are worried they won't finish thats ok. See if you can get what you have working then upload a version to itch, get it all linked up etc so no matter what else happens you have something submitted, then just see how you get on with the rest of the time.
If you learned a bunch then you did well
 LM#4371: ty
 Veqsa#8120:  that dice animation is sick
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: submit it for sure, that;s what you got done during the jam so it is what it is. There's still a day to go though, see if you can get something to load on the screen and "play" properly for sure even if there's no real mechanics or anything
 shuhai#8582: My game only does the opening story now, I'm not sure if i can finish it
 Minus#1843: yeah, if everybody started sending even just names it would be a huge mess xD
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: wish we could have a channel where we can send music we're listening to, but i guess this could get cluttered and messy and hard to moderate fast
 MrBen#0001: I have 11 levels for now
 Minus#1843: it is time for eurobeat power :V
 MrBen#0001: I send 6 mins demo of my game :D
 Wames#8409: Its about the experience
 iofractorg#6427: is it ok to submit a completely unfinished and unplayable game with what I plan for the game to be and complete it after the jam or should I just not submit it at all?
I'll probably get terrible ratings if I do submit but oh well
 MrBen#0001: yoo 6 levels complete 
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Those are demos for feedback, and they can't be rated.
Ratings open when the jam time ends for one week. Anyone who didn't submit a game will have to play some random games and rate them before getting to choose what games they play
 Minus#1843: Good job, My first time in blender ended up with a BSOD, so I think it is mutual hatred between me and Blender xD
 ESC#8775: First time using Blender in my life I feel so accomplished
 Hederlunden#3231: well yeah, you can play those too, but they are probably not that fun to play right now
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: false. People give demos in 
 StarKiller11342#5405: TNX
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: hey it'so okay (nanana) you're welcome (you're welcome)
 Fusoy#6101: In 1 day, 7 hours and 7 minutes
 Hederlunden#3231: when the jam ends
 StarKiller11342#5405: Does anyone know when we will be able to play games
 nicompany#4718: ))
 BadPiggy#5202: Damn song is stuck in my head now
 fibοηezrα#0727: I'll code you a demo
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: not sure the users will thank you for that lol
 Tornado#0975: undstrood nothing lol
 BrokenCalculator#2386: respect
 krisis in a jar#0904: it's a risk i'm willing to take
 BrokenCalculator#2386: yeah and you instead get to deal with memory leaks
 fibοηezrα#0727: Change CardSwipe to CardSwipe = 0, make the last element in your enum NTaskTypes, then generate a number between 1 and (NTaskTypes - 1)
 nicompany#4718: it is more difficult sometimes)
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: guys just look here
 krisis in a jar#0904: i'll be switching to C++ next, so i don't have to deal with performance problems lol
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Take the in depth tech conversation to  please
 Minus#1843: Scriptable Objects are more like item definitions for example. It is basically a "template" to create an object, but it is not in itself a prefab or anything like that.
 BrokenCalculator#2386: ok i think it's time for art
 Tornado#0975: so anyways how do i do this
 BrokenCalculator#2386: yup
 Tornado#0975: actually use scriptable objects for it
 fibοηezrα#0727: yeah, so instead of wasting memory and processing by passing "idle", "walking" to a function, you can just pass 0 1 etc.
 Fusoy#6101: Enums are cool for state machines also
 Minus#1843: enum - list of items, each with different number associated with given name. Numbers and names cannot appear twice in enums. (full name Enumerated List)
 MassedUp#8420: I use enums for weapons and enemy types
 BrokenCalculator#2386: enums can be used for stuff like states for example
0 is idle
1 is walking
2 is jumping
etc etc
 fibοηezrα#0727: enum is kind of like a set in math
 BrokenCalculator#2386: enums are a part of C#, not unity actually. enums basically provide names for number values
 Tornado#0975: no no enum
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: I never heard of enum in unity
you mean IEnumerator?
 MrBen#0001: wow Im going insane on my game 😵‍💫
 fibοηezrα#0727: Escape room
 Fusoy#6101: Grappling Scarf
 Tornado#0975: GG on winning what was ur game
 Tornado#0975: Unity
 Fusoy#6101: Yeah, and that bring a lot of eyes. My winning game from last year still gets hundreds of plays per month. That's a lot for a gamejam game
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: what engine is that
 Tornado#0975: ```private enum TaskType
{
CardSwipe,
LeverPull,
WireSoldering,
NumberedButtonsInOrder,
StartEngineUsingKey,
TEMP1,
TEMP2,
TEMP3,
TEMP4,
TEMP5
}```
I have this enum i wanna make it so that it choses each one in random order but exactly once
 wumpus#3512: no, its just my game does... and i haven't made it yet lmao
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: or if you make it to top 20 you get in the video mark makes at the end of ratings covering the top 20 games. iirc
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: do we have to put win or lose?
mine is an board game rpg haunted house where you catch ghosts and defeat bosses
for now it's only a board game tho
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: you put your skills in test
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: my game's name is super space dice blasters, because i honestly fucking love the arcadey feel of the name
 HappyMajor#5455: Does anyone of you just started out today like me? 😄
 GuyWithTime#7852: U learn something new
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: happiness and views in your game
 Fusoy#6101: Fun
 Jupiter_Butts#3521: what's the prize for this game jam?
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: me, who's games name will be something like haunted house or ghost bustin'
 ProtoXV#2705: There's definitely going to be a couple named "roll for initiative" XD
 Arkeon#9826: Thanks!
 LordCthuluke#1523: Yep, having been always saying 'I will do the next one' - but NO MORE!
 Acu1000#5560: I've seen some on itch io
 Cheesy Crackers#6035: Technically my second jam but the first one where I actually know how making games works xD
 GuyWithTime#7852: 8-bit Operator or something like that I dont remember the exact name
 dardasaba#9759: This is a free pack with 5 awesome fonts that I use all the time :)
 Arkeon#9826: Hi Do someone knows a cool pixelated font ?
 FredsMeds87#3239: Is this anyone else’s first jam? I’m loving the energy!
 Acu1000#5560: > avoided putting "roll", "dice", and "die" in the title
impossible
 dardasaba#9759: My game's name is a dice pun :)
 tykenn#8548: I think I'm going to call mine "The Multiverse Room". So I successfully avoided putting "roll", "dice", and "die" in the title. I can't be the only one, right?
 Acu1000#5560: perfect timing
 Dannycopo#1825: mfw I go to sleep and vs code intellisense suddenly stops working in the morning
 Magnet#2255: One of our early ideas was a very literal explanation of our game, but abbreviated so it became a fake 'word'
 FredsMeds87#3239: Have a notes list of like 20 “dice” puns going, haven’t found the right one yet!
 Magnet#2255: That actually gave me our first non-Dice idea
 Fusoy#6101: That's absolutely okay, mine will have Dice in the title too (Or roll)
 Jupiter_Butts#3521: i cant make this game jam. i have no creativity. good luck u guys!!! ❤️
 Magnet#2255: Certainly, all of our title ideas have the word 'Dice' in them, fully or abbreviated
 honiemun#0001: I don't think I ever wake up this early for my actual job lmao
 rubixkyoob#7530: good morning from east coast US, jammers
 GuyWithTime#7852: Hello!
 honiemun#0001: Good morning chat! 8:30 AM, time to rise and grind
 dardasaba#9759: Oh hey voxal
 Voxaloo#9683: hi godot man
 tykenn#8548: My guess is 73%
 dardasaba#9759: Was gonna ask that xD
 GuyWithTime#7852: Mines gonna have die in the title so does that count?
 Pyth0n#0572: *hastily renames file*
 Sheep777#3876: prob 98%
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: well I was thinking you have a base sentence with blank spaces and you complete it with the random worss
 Fusoy#6101: So, how many % of games will have "Roll" or "Dice" in their titles ?
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: and I'm back after eating
 Henry_Hamster#4240: but how do you rate a 'sentence' or is it like made out of just a adjective, noun, verb/simplistic sentence?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Oooh that just gave me an idea, you play a medium/fortune teller. Someone asks you a question about their future and you roll bones or tarot cards or something that give you random words. Then you have to use the random words you got to make a sentence about their future
 Penguinmanereikel#3708: Hey, so you mentioned that you’re making the same game as me. Can I see your levels?
 CCCFan#8350: This is my first game jam, any advice?
 Pyth0n#0572: back from surfing, now i need to sort out my bugs
 Snage#1337: ima go back to work but good luck gurki and hey still attempt theres like over half the time left
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I'm gonna head out aswell, done a lot of playtesting. I'll be back later to get caught up on  :3
 PickleOstrich#2216: You can always contribute even a little bit helps I think some people wouldn’t mind the little bit you offer
 Gurki#9176: I likely wont work in a team since I've got stuff to do stuff again tonight, meaning I'll miss another 2~ish hours, it'd be unfair on whoever I work with
 Snage#1337: 👋
 Gurki#9176: I've ideas, and have made the project file, that's it
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Good luck!
 PickleOstrich#2216: Try 
 Snage#1337: depends what you mean by started
 japson#4917: Alright on that note I'll go back to work haha 😄 Good luck all see you in a bit
 Gurki#9176: anyone not started yet? My entire night yesterday was spent not at home 💀
 Snage#1337: 💀
 japson#4917: You meant Rolling the Stones? 😶‍🌫️
 Penguinmanereikel#3708: Literally, where I’m Nintendo trying to outsource levels from a community
 Snage#1337: rocking the dice just turns them to stone
 japson#4917: what about a guitar hero because you** rock and roll** the dice?
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Welp first game I playtest that won't even open.
 Snage#1337: mario maker type beat
 Penguinmanereikel#3708: Hey, if anyone like puzzle games, I need someone to help figure out what levels I should make!!! **No technical or cosmetic assets needed.** I just need you to submit your levels. You can literally just make it in Notepad and paste it as a chat message on discord!!!
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: *makes a D20 out of onion*
 PickleOstrich#2216: Someone should absolutely make that
 Snage#1337: you roll the bits of diced onion
 Shimp#0064: ok here is an idea for you people, so game is either just normal game or a deadly virus, depends on the dice roll in the beginning
 PickleOstrich#2216: A game about dicing instead of rng 🤔
 KadDev#8100: alright, thanks for the advice👍
 japson#4917: if anyone makes me roll a dice when I try to quit their game to see if I succeed it's an instant like for me lol
 Sapient#3138: my team diced the dice idea and it died
 japson#4917: if your team members didn't want to do it it feels like it shouldn't be forced onto them? I'd say go full solo and have a blast making what you want even if that wasn't the initial purpose 🙂 also who knows, they might get more involved seeing how you're enjoying it
 Penguinmanereikel#3708: *Rip in piece
 Acu1000#5560: rip
 KadDev#8100: around 6 o clock in the afternoon
 Snage#1337: well do you have any tri overlap with them? time wise i mean
 Inarsy#2392: ouchy
 japson#4917: would be a fun plottwist though, when the sphere stops it zooms in and you can see numbers appearing o.o
 BanananaMonke#3591: Ouch. Dies of dies
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Just casual relax time over here. I hope everyone's games work as they wanted.
 KadDev#8100: I wanted to do this project as a warmup project for my team so we could improve our team skills and have a good time, but my artist doesn't want to do this thing and my music producer is kinda working in the backround, and their timezones are different. So this still feels like I am completely alone, and it's starting to make me lose motivation
 tykenn#8548: Approaching D∞ the more perfect the sphere
 Mythic#7803: medieval cats give good luck, bring fortune and happiness
 japson#4917: haha thx medieval cats drawing are the best indeed
 Snage#1337: love your pfp btw
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Thanks I think they understand
 Alai#0673: i don't know what reward to give to the player that wins in my game like coins and stuff
 Mythic#7803: yep gotta stay hydrated :D
 japson#4917: Good luck ! don't forget to rest well enough and drink water ! 😄
 Snage#1337: no problem these things are built to bring people up
 Mythic#7803: ty everyone for encouraging me :D
 japson#4917: is it though? feels like a sphere would be just a D1000
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: It's jealous. It can only roll while a dice can do so much more.
 Snage#1337: that or a mobius strip
 Lawn#1538: Roll a sphere, and all you get is one choice.
 Mythic#7803: yep i am gonna finish the game even if i am not able to submit
 PickleOstrich#2216: That’s rough why did they block you
 Lawn#1538: It's boring as heck, but I'm starting to think the humble sphere is the enemy of dice. Like, it has only one side.
 tykenn#8548: a prophet
 kcorb#6614: If you try and fail, you'll be better equipped the next time round
 Snage#1337: XDD
 Alai#0673: never gonna give up never let yourself down
 Snage#1337: hey a lot of people dont submit, and thats fine! they learned lots and can always try again! so give your all and get rewarded with new things you wouldnt have known if you didnt!
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: You can do it! Even if you don't make smething you'll atleast have tried! Best of luck your game will be great!
 ⃟pu  ⃟rp  ⃟le  ⃟#1529: something concise..what could it be?
 BrokenCalculator#2386: nice my mvp is done
 Mythic#7803: can someone give me some words of encouragement as i am trying to give up :(
 Lawn#1538: ooo
 Yoshi#0080: you could portray weighted dice as big buff enemy dice lol
 Snage#1337: ooooooo ^ thas a good one
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: a clock. Always on time. strictly, neatly.
 Lawn#1538: If the opposite of random was an object, what would it be?
 Lawn#1538: Don't sweat it.
 Snage#1337: cards, or bad dice molds lol
 Lawn#1538: Hmmm other gambling stuff hey
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: OH XD sorry I don't know.
 Shimp#0064: i decided that yesterday
cards, coins, other gambling stuff
 Snage#1337: cards, the only other popular random medium
 Lawn#1538: There's no punchline, I just want to know your thoughts
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I don't know. Tell me.
 Lawn#1538: What is the mortal enemy of dice?
 R4zorcl4w77#9100: man...
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Oh I feel for you.
 sushiman#4823: my teammate blocked me....
 Shimp#0064: i did, woke up early tho
 Snage#1337: i mean did you sleep around the same time your about to?
 Alai#0673: just a stock game simulation
 Shimp#0064: damn, i didn't expect to get that tired so quickly
 UniversalAsshole#4809: can u tell us so I can blatantly copy it for my game?
 Alai#0673: oh thank god i've done my mechanic of the game
 Snage#1337: just gotta connect to the theme of "roll of the dice" as long as there is an argument for it you'll be fine
 UniversalAsshole#4809: you can interpret it however you like... as far as i have heard.
 PickleOstrich#2216: The prompt is how you interpret it
 sushiman#4823: randomness
 Alai#0673: does the game for this gamejam have to do with dice or just have to do with randomness?
 ZedDev#4726: Oh just got an idea,since the player is a dice, why not show it's health with the top face?
 UniversalAsshole#4809:  off topic, but how flawed do you think the original Friday Night Funkin's base code is? Well, at least in terms of the input system (before Week 7 update).
 ^_^#9116: Have fun
 Punocchio#8834: We're doing a Train Jam. Friend and I are travelling home from holidays for 8 hours. Would share a picture, but I can't. But it's a pretty memorable experience, ngl
 Tornado#0975: is ttf format fine
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Have a nice meal.
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: Spelling? *harry potter sounds*
anywoo imma pause and eat now
 ZedDev#4726: Yeah my keyboard messed it up (Android Gboard)
 LOPSTERu#3902: the spelling is dining btw
 ZedDev#4726: English isn't even my main language lol
 longestsoloever#5342: I would use something wider. Look for a bold, blocky sans serif
 UniversalAsshole#4809: dining room?
 ZedDev#4726: Dinning room
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: how is the room where you eat called in english?
 longestsoloever#5342: I was making a Stranger Things related thumbnail and found the exact font they used within seconds, free
 longestsoloever#5342: Dafont is great. That or just googling for the style you want
 UniversalAsshole#4809: The internet, of course!
 wumpus#3512: dafont?
 Tornado#0975: anyone know any good place to find fonts
 longestsoloever#5342: Probably
 UniversalAsshole#4809: no wey are u dat guy who did da thing
 Clive Dev#0446: 🤨
 ZedDev#4726: The hardest part of my game will either be the enemy AI or the room generator
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Congrats on that already.
 LordOfRage#8914: nice i have a white block that can run and jump
 Clive Dev#0446: Roll of the dice
 theChief#0001: roll of the dice!
 longestsoloever#5342: Got a working, playable prototype last night. Now getting artwork and level designs in
 GavinTheNewbie#4572: What is the Theme for this year game jam?
 Alai#0673: good maybe
 ZedDev#4726: Fine, i need to work on 3 things and the game can be considered playable
 Snake95991#6766: Pain
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: How's everyone doing?
 Alai#0673: i ran out of an ides
 ZedDev#4726: Does A* work on WebGL builds of unity?
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I'm done with my work for now.
 Tapu#9161: Lmao that's what I'm making
 Snory#4231: sick indeed
 MrBen#0001: 
 Punocchio#8834: Chances are you have ideas but think they are bad. Just take some simple idea and go with it 🙂 Don't be a perfectionist
 ShinigamiKouhai666#3121: the most basic idea I have is just basic board game
 Snory#4231: Mind sharing? 😉
 MrBen#0001: the limbo style of my game is SO SICK
 Ðazed♡#8249: man i dont have an idea why am i so bad at ideas
 PickleOstrich#2216: Might be worth restarting just to get something you’re more happy with
 pandabond#4740: I have half a mind to restart
 PickleOstrich#2216: Ours is like hotline Miami in a casino
 ShinigamiKouhai666#3121: what happen?
 pandabond#4740: I hate everything about my game
 Vabenil#5485: That's also interesting, I'm really curious what games people will be making
 PickleOstrich#2216: Ours has randomness but it’s not the biggest focus tbh
 Snory#4231: Mine is going to be without randomness
 PickleOstrich#2216: Tbh I wasn’t a fan of the theme either
 Vabenil#5485: I think the theme, is good, it encourages randomness which in my opinion is good
 Snory#4231: Me too! I am actually quite happy about it, even though i didnt like the theme at frist
 Tapu#9161: Spent like an hour trying to make stuff snap back to its place
 Mono#7785: oh hahaha
 PickleOstrich#2216: I think they were trying to inspire you lol
 Mono#7785: You can do it 💪
 LM#4371: I've spent like 4 hours on my game and its 70% finished now (needs polishing and some sprites)
 krisis in a jar#0904: Mine's also small but I spent like 4 hours trying to figure how to build the game
 wumpus#3512: still have ages to complete it, dw
 Mono#7785: I just came up with a decent idea lol. Let's see if I can make it in time
 who-is-Ellie#8917: I mean like.. I pushed my game just so i'm 'safe' and have something submitted, but it's definitely nowhere near done
 LM#4371: Endless games are not that hard to make
 Russian posh cat support ukraine#6575: true
 PickleOstrich#2216: Rtx on
 wumpus#3512: most of the finished games are small
 Russian posh cat support ukraine#6575: HOW ARE PEOPLE DONE ALREADYYYY
 Mono#7785: Good luck
 krisis in a jar#0904: Time to torture myself into finishing the game! Yaaayyyyy
 PickleOstrich#2216: 
 ImZary#0765: late joiner channels?
 Tapu#9161: I don't even have may gameplay done
 PickleOstrich#2216: Some people are still looking for people in the late joiner channels maybe you can merge
 wumpus#3512: looking at  it makes me very glad that im not alone in still having an unfinished prototype and dev textures
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: and a ghost radar/map for task stuff
 ImZary#0765: so... *what am exactly supposed to do now-*
my friend is feeling sick and is likely gonna leave the jam , and now i am.... left alone on a project i for sure cant finish alone
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: so I will put 5 bosses for start today
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: cool
why you have a quilava avatar, cyndaquil?
 PickleOstrich#2216: I agree they seem easier to me we are using tiles
 Cyndaquil#2646: It saves time
 Cyndaquil#2646: Tiles you can reuse them
 PickleOstrich#2216: Yeah not a bad idea thanks for the tip
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: shall I make the map 1 thing or tiles?
 quantum#0043: till now messi rn my boy benzi
 nicompany#4718: i think Xavi
 Blur#9118: particle system so fun
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: seems like it's time to think how the map will be
 UnknownDawn#2602: Just try skechin' some things before they wake! Surprise em!
 PickleOstrich#2216: Yeah I can make the art we need fast I just need them to tell me what to make we’re 2d though so it should be easy
 nicompany#4718: who is the goat playmaker in football?
 CodingLord#1012: What's a team
 xqrd#4298: nah im working solo
 quantum#0043: my game is good cuz i use Playmaker
 nicompany#4718: )
 PickleOstrich#2216: Yeah I didn’t want to code
 Blur#9118: 🥲
 MCCV#1542: nope
 nicompany#4718: u guys have a team?
 xqrd#4298: its my first time making a top-down game
 UnknownDawn#2602: Ive been grinding 3d models, I feel ya, just waiting for my team to wake up!
 PickleOstrich#2216: Am I the only one who can’t sleep because I’m anxiously awaiting my team to wake up so I can make the art assets
 KaineShadory#1612: kind of hit a wall and idk if I'm cut out for this lul
 CodingLord#1012: This is my first time making a board game
 Jasper#7906: And give you a million copyright headaches down the line...
 who-is-Ellie#8917: i will not let AI take away my job >:( (jk ofc)
 Daniel's Lion#2240: lucky, i don't even have a workin script yet
 39#6748: yall need to use github copilot if you dont do that already, it will save you lots of nerves
 Tornado#0975: do i multiply getaxisraw with time.deltatime
 SeanSS#0892: Im reusing my old platformer controller
 Koolento#6688: honestly prob not gonna finnish, but im glad ive learned about 3d game making for the first time
 who-is-Ellie#8917: yeah 😅  That and all the dumb architecture mistakes i've made/am making, cause UE's arch is so different to Godot/Unity .-.
 SeanSS#0892: Im working on the art rn
 Michel#2879: I already wanted to fix my sleep schedule. So the jam help
 Tornado#0975: is it only me that is still making character controller or are yall making it aswell
 39#6748: i also was about to do that, but i thought if i at least sleep 5 hours and drink alot of coffee, my results will be better
 Blur#9118: great thanks 😎
 SeanSS#0892: Hang in there brother
 Tornado#0975: FINISHED SO EARY whatt i am just making the character controller rn
 xqrd#4298: im working rn on the main mechanics
 Michel#2879: I actually had no sleep that's why I finished early
 quantum#0043:  yes
 Jasper#7906: It is. There's even a channel for that (but it only allows posting once per 6 hours)
 Snory#4231: player control only so far 🙂
 Snage#1337: 00F, tutorials taking up time?
 Michel#2879: I finished. Would anyone like to try it?
also is it legit to leak games before the votig starts
 SeanSS#0892: How's everyone's jam progress going?
 who-is-Ellie#8917: not good lol, using godot was a mistake 😅 (not because it's a bad engine or anything, I just have no idea how to use it :p)
 Daniel's Lion#2240: I got an animated character and a big dice now. now i have to make it roll randomly
 Tornado#0975: hows yall's game doin
 sbubby#4885: Ok time to wake up and Worry A Lot
 No_Namer007#8260: uptill now i was just doing art/design lol
 dardasaba#9759: XD
 Jasper#7906: I've reached the point where my game is playable. The current gameplay is: alternate clicking the left and right button and hope that RNG is on your side.
 xqrd#4298: im doing a game where you are a chef so kinda based on overcooked
 Snage#1337: cus i love that game and seeing that progress pic was really cool
 Snage#1337: you the guy doing the overcooked lookin?
 Daniel's Lion#2240: maybe i can have a quick look at it
 Snage#1337: go right ahead 👍
 xqrd#4298: good actually im working on different food orders and art
 Beardules#6108:  thats cool, mind if I DM you?
 Snage#1337: i might b able to but no promises cuz im not too experienced
 BrokenCalculator#2386: finishing up the main mechanics, everything going smoothly
 Klemp#9694: how you doing people?
 Snage#1337: no problem and good luck!
 dardasaba#9759: I'm making really good progress, in the ~2 hours I've been working I got the game pretty much done
Meaning I have two days for music, sounds, polish, particles, menus, etc
 No_Namer007#8260: alright... thanks 😄
 who-is-Ellie#8917: too late to switch engines you reckon? 😅 Considering getting UE's WASM builds working cause i'm just so much faster there lol
 BrokenCalculator#2386: hmm, well that depends on the game if it is a windowed game. if it is fullscreen, then probably 1920x1080
 kcorb#6614: Yeah a width and height that fits that ratio so like 640x360 will scale nicely into 1920x1080
 Peewi#8572: If you don't have time do graphics options or auto-detection of desktop resolution, I'd probably go with a 1280x720 window
 Veqsa#8120:  that gives me club pinguïn vibes haha
 Beardules#6108: I'm fairly new to this so I'm sure the problem is a simple one
 adrenalyzed#5024: if youre using unity u can use render textures to edit the resolution of ur game while playing
 Snage#1337: just make it all seem to fit into a theme and ppl will tolerate it trust me
 Mikulus#7616: I mean width and height of window, not screen ratio
 Beardules#6108: Anyone able to look over some code for me? I've got a working RNG that picks a number every 10 seconds, but I'm struggling to pause the on-screen visuals (a dice block) so that the player can see what number has been picked
 No_Namer007#8260: my personal art looks so bad lol
 BrokenCalculator#2386: most common ratio would be 16:9
 Mikulus#7616: this question was probably already asked many times but what's the preffered window resolution for game?
 Snage#1337: no problem 👍
 Itooh#5008: I was wondering how one way collisions could be implemented in Godot, if it was een possible for the type of physics I had in mind, and… Turns out you only have to activate the checkbox convenientely named “*One Way Collision*”.
I love this engine.
 DarkFluo#1049: wow sounds nice ! I'll be adding that one to my playlist, thanks !
 adrenalyzed#5024: not with that attitude
 Chinwizard#2798: So lights don't work on 4d? damn....
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: me, who now has to build the world (actually I will make the rpg mechanics ya know hehe)
 adrenalyzed#5024: if your game looks bad and its 2d or 3d, use lights, trust me they are magical
this one is p good for just calm background vibes, its a good loop too
 xqrd#4298: finally i fixed the dice
 BrokenCalculator#2386: wait is it not possible to show 2d arrays in the inspector in unity?
 graygray#8956: Yeah thats the dark zone of talented (well atleast more hardworking than me) people, I hang out here for a reason 🤣
 PickleOstrich#2216: I don’t code but in the background I listen to drum and bass it’s good for building energy there’s a YouTube called “4am breaks” highly recommend
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: finished player movement completely, with animations and dices
 Taccos#1054: man im really acing progress with my game
 Fox#3756: Sigh. Why is it so difficult to break out of an accidental infinite loop in Unity?
 Arfilish#8729: The only thing i can show is only weapon model i made for game
 Magnet#2255: Yesterday I had a playlist of Guilty Gear music that eventually diverted into mixed J-action game songs. Today it's podcasts and twitch VODs
 ReDim#0945: bruh unity loading for 8 min...
 BrokenCalculator#2386: PvZ OST
 LOPSTERu#3902: oh my god everything in  looks so much better than my game
 Karto#7782: I have the dice roll mechanic done but still have no idea what the gameplay will be :)
 AEIOU#0652: Listening deja vu
 LiquidCode#4117: I Love that library but im programming the Game Informer Godot XD
 nicompany#4718: phonk
 Furia25#0769: Some guys are so fast, they already compile a version of their game 🤯
 keb#6637: good luck
 DarkFluo#1049: Okay, time for me to take another little break ! I'd like to know, do you have a playlist of music running in the background while you code ? What do you listen to ?
 CodingLord#1012: iamma look for some way to fix it
 keb#6637: looks awesome!
 hungryroy#0352: really should have just done something arcady like a platformer or shooter, but i couldnt think of a good way to tie those to the theme
 MrBen#0001: what do you think about limbo look in  ?
 keb#6637: you should try it out if you don't like unity's endless loading
 MCCV#1542: haha, try to focus on an mvp first, then expand
 graygray#8956: Game jams dont need a game if you're focusing on one section, they're about growth
 hungryroy#0352: i already started earlier but progress is super slow; i think my idea might be good, but there's so many steps to get to something minimum workable im just so unmotivated lol
 CodingLord#1012: I dont like Godot because I am not familiar with it
 Arfilish#8729: It seems like i won't do game in time
 K'miinik#3171: every engine is good for certain things
 MCCV#1542: no reason to only know how to use one engine, get comfy with all of them
 SLiV#5820: Man, turns out making an entire game is a lot of work 😅
 LOPSTERu#3902: well its not even passable for me
 keb#6637: godot:
 K'miinik#3171: art doesn't have to be good, it just has to be passable
 quantum#0043:  same here graphics are cool
 MCCV#1542: I use both godot unity and unreal dependent on project and team size
 keb#6637: yea i know but i still need to learn how to make games look good lol.
 BrokenCalculator#2386: my problem is that i've used unity for 2 years and i don't feel like abandoning it now and learning something new
 CodingLord#1012: my laptop not built for Unity then
 K'miinik#3171: cope
 quantum#0043:  it works fine
 MCCV#1542: join godot
 CodingLord#1012: Why does Unity load so much 😭  I wish it were smooth
 BrokenCalculator#2386: i mean, i think gameplay is more important than anything in a game, but ig it's fine as long as the gameplay is fun
 keb#6637: this jam i am trying to focus more on graphics rather than actual gameplay. at least  the game looks good right???
 CodingLord#1012: omg 💀
 BadPiggy#5202: My idea works for some reason
 williamdoro#8857: you have 35 hours left
 williamdoro#8857: 8 hours 45 minutes of me doing this jam so far
 quantum#0043:  taking too long
 CodingLord#1012: how about construct? Its easy and Construct 2 is free
 xqrd#4298: im having a hard time with making the dice work properly
 Klemp#9694: I cannot tell you the pain of trying to code this in python
 Azurezero#4851: if i was prepared to learn unity i'd have done so before the jam
 TheChronicPhenix#1205: Welp just shy of 17 hours, that'll be it for me today, time to get some rest, or try anyway, good luck to all the rest of you, can't wait to see what people come up with!
 xqrd#4298: gl! 🙂
 ⃟pu  ⃟rp  ⃟le  ⃟#1529: but cant wait to see your finished games
 BrokenCalculator#2386: i wanted to use raylib but i pussied out and picked unity instead
 CodingLord#1012: Yes, I spent time in sleeping and school. Wish me luck
 sushiman#4823: good luck because i don't understand my code.. but it works ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 DumbTost#1347: am i the only one who uses raylib rn? lol pretty sure most people using unity or unreal
 ⃟pu  ⃟rp  ⃟le  ⃟#1529: i wish i could join
 Ðazed♡#8249: back to thinking of ideas
 xqrd#4298: wait now?
 CodingLord#1012: Guys I am starting my project now
 ⃟pu  ⃟rp  ⃟le  ⃟#1529: why dont you try other engine?try to solve that gamemaker issue later after the game jam..
 xqrd#4298: im trying to get the points to add when the highest numbers are rolled but its subtracting them for some reason
 Azurezero#4851: my entire project relies on me being able to solve that one rotation issue and i just cant see it happening
 ⃟pu  ⃟rp  ⃟le  ⃟#1529: is there anyone who hasnt started yet?
 Ðazed♡#8249: i hate being far into my game and figuring out it sorta sucks
 Ðazed♡#8249: damnit i now cant see my game being fun
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: Yay! Dice movement system is now visualised! Time to also visualise player movement and then I will work on the battle system
 Peewi#8572: I guess I'd first roll 1-6 to get the normal dice roll and then 1-4 to determine which sprite to use
 steeleater#7580: plus i don't have any experience in 3d unity
 Peewi#8572: oh, I'd probably only have bothered with 1 sprite for each top number. Maybe even leave the sides blank for clarity. Then again, I'm currently planning on using squares with dots.
 steeleater#7580: it's pixel art. id have to make a custom render if i wanted the styles to match
 skejeton#5788: depends on the engine you can make 3d models appear in 2d worlds
 steeleater#7580: i had to make 24 sprites for every die arrangement because i don't feel like i have the skill to stitch them together
 Peewi#8572: even if your die is isometric, wouldn't you still just have a sprite for each facing? Referencing a real die if necessary
 steeleater#7580: it's 2d
 skejeton#5788: can you just make a model of a die
 Michel#2879: God I finished... life is beautiful
 Maynu#4742: Yooooo
 steeleater#7580: as in you could look at a real die the same way and see the same pattern
 skejeton#5788: wdym accurate
 steeleater#7580: you need to see 3 sides at once and they all have to be accurate relative to each other
 KaineShadory#1612: wow I didn't know about this thanks!!
 Lolsebca#6116: Spent like 1 hour on a dialog system and it didn't work xD
 steeleater#7580: it's an isometric thing
 skejeton#5788: you can just make a 6 sprite animation of a die, and then set the frame to random value between 0 to 5 (if zero is first index)
 steeleater#7580: anyone have any better implementation ideas
 steeleater#7580: i just spent an hour writing a script that's in charge of keeping track of the visible sides of a die and what they say and now there's 2 sixes on it and it's invisible
 Zayn#4390: Alright im back from a lunch break
 tykenn#8548: That's why I rely on mixamo to do all my rigging during jams (and avoid making non-humanoids)
 BrokenCalculator#2386: nice
 Zayn#4390: already did 🙂
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: unity crashed (cry about it)
 Tornado#0975: how do i implement movement
I hate myself not doing everything dynamically
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: anyone else making a character creator
 Redline#7370: 🫖
 ron0studios#4591: tea gang 🍵
 Redline#7370: I drink tea 😎
 CodingLord#1012: I have already wasted over 16 hours on sleep and school, I haven't even made a project 💀
 ron0studios#4591: we drink red bull and coffee
 KaineShadory#1612: only ever done it in Maya lmao
 No_Namer007#8260: 🤣
 BrokenCalculator#2386: real water is often very disappointing
 KaineShadory#1612: tfw never animated/rigged in Unity and I'm pulling my hair over it
 darlingS#1797: Water you even talking about
 No_Namer007#8260: "we'll just code in our own water, no need to get real water" -  , 2022 some very wise words
 The fair point guy#9951: Is it some strange machine?
 BrokenCalculator#2386: we'll just code in our own water, no need to get real water
 quantum#0043: what is water
 No_Namer007#8260: ive participated in 2 smaller jams but this is first GMTK/big one
 The fair point guy#9951: This is the truth.
 Anxeal#4160: what's a water
 ron0studios#4591: haha.. who needs water...? we're game devs!
 quantum#0043: nice
 Tapu#9161: Don't forget to drink water
 ron0studios#4591: yikes that sounds hard
 The fair point guy#9951: I am.
 quantum#0043:  yup
 ron0studios#4591: 3d?
 quantum#0043: anyone else making a first person game
 BrokenCalculator#2386: time to do UI, my least favorite part of game dev
 6746#9763: The game im making reminds me very much of a buggy game I couldn't finish for a game jam because the game jam had.. 3 days. wish me luck
 ScottD#6698: Version Control is your friend, even for Jams... especially for jams
 ron0studios#4591: ive gotten the most juiciest dice stacking
 SEB1#1770: How is it going men?
 BrokenCalculator#2386: hope you can recover
 ron0studios#4591: is anyone else doing dice stacking?
 Redline#7370: f
 OrangeKingdom#9769: I am going to pre-made asset for the character
I will create the background and others by myself
 Zayn#4390: Fuck my scripts got corrupted !!!!
 OrangeKingdom#9769: I found a cool character
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: welp back to  I go. Got some of them to play I missed while being asleep. Good luck you wonderful people!
 Capybara#8868: im actually getting buried in my own spaghett jesus christ
 Lukey#6052: :D
 Zayn#4390: Goodnight 😄 !
 nicompany#4718: good night
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Good night!
 Lukey#6052: Okay guys! I'm gonna go sleep. Hopefully in the morning I will fix my code :D
I won't have all day tomorrow to work but I will have most. Ok bye goodnight sleep well take care of yourselves drink water and don't stress byeeeee
 Zayn#4390: Ok unity just crashed, Panik everybody
 Taccos#1054: aight enemy working perfect
 Magnet#2255: Technically second, but the first was a month-long one that was very low-expectation on actual mechanics and much more narrative focus
 LordCthuluke#1523: Its a first for me!
 Zayn#4390: Not really, its like my 15th or something, but it is my first GMTK Jam lol
 nicompany#4718: congratulations)
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: yup.
 SpeedWolfy#3389: yass
 OrangeKingdom#9769: My game name: **Everything is luck**
😅
 nicompany#4718: friends, is it your first gamejam?
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I'm aiming to playtest as many games as I can fit in (and secretly hope they do well)
 AlpalcaLad#2549: pogg
 ^_^#9116: Dhanks dro
 Zayn#4390: Alright boyz my game is Lookin SPICY!
 BrokenCalculator#2386: i have more time this time since i was busy on sunday last jam so i think it might happen
 SpeedWolfy#3389: Lmao. Dice dock dro 🙂
 wren#0640: I'm only aiming for top 50% tbh, but the response to my posts in  has me a bit more confident :)
 Magnet#2255: Not especially, but trucking along anyhow
 ^_^#9116: Yes
Its all about a dice time
 KimTheMightyChim#0685: Mine is to actually finish the game
 yumaikas#3530: I think I'm already ahead there due to being on a team with an artist?
 Jupiter_Butts#3521: you guys all know what to do???
 nicompany#4718: +
 BrokenCalculator#2386: a secondary but not as important goal is to make a better game than the one i made for GMTK 2021
 SpeedWolfy#3389: It is not about winning other projects. It's about winning yourself, create something and have a dice time!
 Aiminer357#8033: my goal rn is top 10%. barely scrapped it last year
 OrangeKingdom#9769: you right, this about building your skills
 BrokenCalculator#2386: my goal for this jam is to not come last
 farkon00#0500: My answer to can i finish my game:
 wren#0640: I don't really think you should go into this sort of thing with the goal of getting into top 20 tbh
 Lukey#6052: from what I know, getting top 100 is probably gonna be difficult toooo
 yumaikas#3530: If you can achieve the world's best idea, and get it recognised. But it's *super* unlikely unless you go for a *very* minimalistic style
 keb#6637: yea just make a good game
 OrangeKingdom#9769: wow, great
 BrokenCalculator#2386: **yesn't**
 Redline#7370: **no.**
 vicksonzero (Him | Web/Unity)#2295: worked for the whole day and still haven't finished the scafolding for js socket.io phaser3 setup
 OrangeKingdom#9769: **Can I get at least to the top 20 without any art design??**
 Zayn#4390: I already did lmfao
 Azurezero#4851: even if i was only making a game that involved random chance i'd still want to actually roll some dice, instead of just playing a sound and setting a sprite frame to 0-5
 Jupiter_Butts#3521: Anyone is like me? because im lost and idk what to do for this. Im out of creativity 😦
 quantum#0043: im level designing
 TheProvisionGames#5901: Kenney is the "asset Jesus", as game designers call him. He has some free and paid stuff. I use his asset forge to make simple objects. It's all very well designed
 BrokenCalculator#2386: exercise is not for game devs
 Redline#7370: ok people time to get up from the chair and stretch a bit
 nicompany#4718: guys, don't worry, its all your experience, if u dont surrender now, it will be easier to do in your future!😀
 LOPSTERu#3902: oh nice i didnt even know about these
 OrangeKingdom#9769: Don't wanna create all assets by yourself
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I jyst playtested someone's game and it's so fun to just play games and get to tell what was good and what can beimproved.
 Hypex#1660: try kenney.nl or opengameart
 OrangeKingdom#9769: great
 LOPSTERu#3902: man it takes me way to long to do art its not even good
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Sounds great!
 CM69Time#0494: We are making a casino cheating game.
 yugioh#7402: Hype
 CM69Time#0494: Yaahoo!
 OrangeKingdom#9769: 34 hours left ⏰
 ⃟pu  ⃟rp  ⃟le  ⃟#1529: can you get or set rotation matrix through script in gamemaker?
Then you can adapt to modern GameMaker
 OrangeKingdom#9769: First want to listen to some songs
Then I'll start 😜
 Azurezero#4851: ive done a dungeon crawler before, but now i have to deal with actual transforms and rotations
 Hypex#1660: how does game maker scripting work? you might be able to find smth similar and try your best to learn the engine
it's not the _best_ idea, but it'll _kinda_ work? idk
 OrangeKingdom#9769: I have an idea
It's a platformer game so going to be hard
Now I am going to start it
Hope nothing went wrong
 Azurezero#4851: should i try again in gms2?
im dealing with d3d_transform_set_rotation_y and x
 Hypex#1660: Not even close to that...
 skejeton#5788: oh snap i found a godot bug lol
 ChopieTheCat#5876: me and the bois going to sleep at 5 am heheheha 6 hour sleep time (also this is my first game jam + this is the first time ive ever made a game + i dont know what im doing skill issue heheheha)
you got dis guys whoever reads this im way too tired i dont know why im typing this lmao
 OrangeKingdom#9769: Hey friends
Did you start your game
 ⃟pu  ⃟rp  ⃟le  ⃟#1529: really? i thought it has quaternion
 Hypex#1660: thanks
 Henry_Hamster#4240: never thought the 'simplest' game idea I've had would take the longest time to create D:
 Azurezero#4851: game maker doesnt deal in quarternions
 Sir Tetris#1382: pretty sure just having rng be a big factor in your game without any physical dice is fine for the theme
 hierophant#1464: im making it you roll dice to get dice points to role more dice and you might win a pigeon  there was a black out and i loss at lot of time
 ⃟pu  ⃟rp  ⃟le  ⃟#1529: probably what you want is to store the current quaternion, then when you want to rotate again just postmultiply your new quaternion with the one you store
 Scarfinger#6298: The feeling when you undo the changing of some names in file explorer, press ctrl-z too many times, undoes the creation of the folder where you exported all your sprites.
 Azurezero#4851: the only way i feel i can actually keep the theme is by rendering a 3d dice
and i just cant get the code right to rotate it
 hierophant#1464: i made a skinner box
 BrokenCalculator#2386: i made the dice in my game based on timing rather than rng on what number you roll which should hopefully make the gameplay more fun
 Hypex#1660: is it okay if you just keep it as an element of the game, not the game's idea itself?
So like I could keep it as an element of chance or smth
 endritDev#2830: Honestly I just took the very basic one, rolling dices -.-
 Azurezero#4851: none, the theme was too limiting
i had a great idea that i cant even start because game maker sucks
 Hypex#1660: Does anyone have any suggestions on how to come up with an idea?
 endritDev#2830: And that's totally fine
 BanananaMonke#3591: 👋
 endritDev#2830: Hello folks 👋🏻
 BrokenCalculator#2386: hi
 BanananaMonke#3591: i hope so :) but i have aa very very standard/basic game
 yugioh#7402: Hello everyone
 Redline#7370: so does mine, just need to give it some time
 endritDev#2830: It would have been great If I wasn't working these 2days , I'll do my best to make smith playable
 Zayn#4390: dont give up 🙂 just keep going and im sure you will have a good result in the end
 Zayn#4390: Alright, took a little break, and now im back! and boy am I feelin good
 Alejo#9544: lmao
 BanananaMonke#3591: damn my game sucks
 Azurezero#4851: if i knew unity it would probably just be a matter of having a bone parent that always faces upwards and handle the rotation in a child
 Azurezero#4851: i've spent 8 hours trying to get a simple dice roll in gm 3d, but each time i think i've done it something else goes wrong... it should not be this hard to rotate a cube along a global axis, but theres no such thing as global axis in this
current problem is, when the cube rotates, so do the axis, so now it rolls in a different direction
moves left, rolls right or spins on the spot instead of rolling
 Viatrix#3575: honestly same
 Azurezero#4851: im wishing i hadnt bothered trying... it's just completely tanked my mood and its affecting my stomach
 ShinigamiKouhai666#3121: well fun fact the theme of roll the dice reminds me of kite, from hunter x hunter lol
 dave_ja#4419: And if you don't finish Itch has a LOT of 'finish that project!' jams which you can join
 Aless.c06#6763: bruh my art sucks
 MorseCode#3009: Hey all, I'm working on an idea that I'm not 100% about yet.  My idea is to create a pet/Tamagotchi game where you buy loot boxes to get things for your pet.  I'd like the game to twist at some point where you can't afford the loot boxes and start selling your body parts and your pet becomes increasingly more demanding till you die.
Right now, the RNG part feels tacked on and isn't integral to the core idea.  Does anyone have an idea for how to make the RNG more integral to my game concept?
 bzar#0579: keep going.
 GodOfPro#7302: its a different thing to don't know anything
 Azurezero#4851: my ideas were, make devil dice puzzle mode, and, dice gun
but dice gun wouldnt really be rolling because it would have to be 2d sprites
 quyteriyaki#6095: I would honestly suggest to at least try to somehow complete it, but not in the time frame, maybe take a week or a month to complete it
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: dude this is what a jam is for
googling
stay
 GodOfPro#7302: i don't think i will continue the jam. i am new so i need to google every second and it is frustrating to say the least lol
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: finsished some of the main arts (dice and character)
 LOPSTERu#3902: i just interpret the theme as something with randomness lol
 quyteriyaki#6095: there's lots of people taking the meaning of the "roll" instead of the actual "roll" itself, I was thinking of something where you throw dice at another dice but that's too physicsy and harder to implement any skill
 nicompany#4718: friends, how old are u?
 Azurezero#4851: without the actual rolling of a dice i feel like im not using the theme properly
but i cant
 quyteriyaki#6095: my solution for no drawing skills is a game with no drawing skills as a theme 🏃
pencil texture, ugly but vague drawing, "haha yes paper background"
 caibi#5324: I make a dice to play game! no dice points, no moves
 Charles#0330: ok, a bit late to the party but i'm in for the jam !
 CSharp#4989: the slow realization I have to actual level design instead of funny tech demo programmer art
 Comfie#3125: game jam is an event where participants try to make a video game from scratch. Depending on the format, participants might work independently, or in teams. The event duration usually ranges from 24 to 72 hours (from wikipedia)
 Azurezero#4851: the only way i could make a rolling dice with what i know and i cant even do that right
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: how to explain to my parents what a game jam is - they dont seem to understand the time contraint
 Azurezero#4851: i feel like this theme is more limiting than any of the ones in the past
 Fusoy#6101: There's these 3 categories of judging :  enjoyment, creativity, and presentation. So not having sound will lower your presentation rating a bit, I guess
 Comfie#3125: I can start in like 8 hours! Excited hahah
 KokoBird#9800: Sound is pretty important to make things feel more together and get certain moods across. Games without sound are generally less gripping- but not always
 Zayn#4390: I got alot of the core mechanics done. Just need to make a few more scripts and some levels and Im done 😄
 Cass Cuttlefish#5543: i looked through some pages and it didn't like like it was mentioned at all
 Lukey#6052: so 15 - 48 = 33 so like 33 hours left
 adrenalyzed#5024: like 15 and a half hours have passed
 Cass Cuttlefish#5543: beeep. sorry for jumping in outta nowhere - i'm just checking that there aren't any rules against posting clips of your progress online? (eg. twitter, other socials)
 Selviam#7268: are games made without sound usually ranked lower?
 LOPSTERu#3902: wait what how much time left
 Lukey#6052: You know what? It's okay. If anyone is feeling like they're wayy behind, just remember that there's like a thousand other people just like you right now.
 GodOfPro#7302: still haven't done anything lol
 Lukey#6052: same lol
 Comfie#3125: Agh, I’ll have less than 24 hours to actually make my game. Kinda stressful
 Zayn#4390: Same 🙂
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Oh. Get well soon!
 BanananaMonke#3591: i got warm today
 AiiArief#3090: guys, take care of your health. I just got cold today 😷
 Redline#7370: I'm a quicc boi so I'll probably finish like 70% of my game today
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I wish everyone a lot of luck finishing. :)
 adrenalyzed#5024: bro i only have player movement shooting and a*
 Henry_Hamster#4240: I've just been stuck for so longgg... D:
 Hederlunden#3231: ive only made a paper prototype and graphics
 MCCV#1542: I have only create a spaceship model
 Lukey#6052: holy shit ive only made like a cube that bounces with some juicy particles (since i reset cuz old project was bad)
 Sub  Zero#0830: lol they at least gave us 2 more lol I ain't even gonna sleep rn sadly
 adrenalyzed#5024: oh my
 Hederlunden#3231: i havent even started coding
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: It's been 15 hours and 28 minutes.
 Lukey#6052: 15?!?!?!!
 Henry_Hamster#4240: 15 :28 or something idk
 Hederlunden#3231: oh no
 Sub  Zero#0830: More than 15 hours actually
 gamedevperson#8448: hello chat
 Henry_Hamster#4240: i think right 11+4
 Redline#7370: oh god it has been 15 hours????????
 Sub  Zero#0830: Yeah I know time zone sometimes suck lol
 Zayn#4390: just added lava as an obstacle to my game 😄
 pandabond#4740: Haha i still dont understand the new input system.... So just hacking my way forwaff
 Henry_Hamster#4240:   is probably your best bet now thats its been 15 hours since the jam started
 Sub  Zero#0830: How to find team actually?
 LethalChicken#3001: Ah I know, I'll simplify. Instead of making enemies and such I'll make it into a very frustrating 3D platformer
 pixal#1121: Still better than working couple of hours on input system
 KokoBird#9800: yeah its bloody hard trying to think of an interesting idea. Mine unintentionally teeters reaaal close to dicey dungeons but i think it should be unique enough, if not I'll find a way to mix it up
 pandabond#4740: I feel its the opposite with this theme. Like an obvious dice game idea comes jumping from the theme. But finding an intresting new one is so so hard
 KokoBird#9800: nice! Best of luck with it. I'm gonna try and start prototyping now as well. Thinking of ideas is hard
 pandabond#4740: Nope working been struggling to make my idea interesting so doing a lot of stuff but the actually game. But hey i just spent a couple of hours working on spring joints!
 Ðazed♡#8249: my game looks like ass atm tbh and i think its cus how im making the gameplay so i might see if i can just use a shader from shadertoy
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Luckily I think I can just sit behind my pc all day. Life is fun waiting for pings until people need you XD I may check out the   and do some of them that I missed.
 KokoBird#9800: have you been doing the art then, Panda?
 Yollie#2239: Family comes before jam unless its like a trip to go fishing with an 8 hour car ride when its raining or something \
 pandabond#4740: I thought my game was too short. Its half time nearly and I'm no where near even starting the game design or mechanics
 Sebby#0271: i dont even know what to do
 sendhelpidfk#6700: mine wouldn't have been too overscoped if i didn't run into file corruption issues
 DrNukeLear#2414: Then when you’re older and you’ve got a place of your own they just turn up mid Game Jam.
 ProtoXV#2705: Gotta say, the platformer toolkit really coming in handy, trying to play around with the curves for my character
 Sebby#0271: hi
 Henry_Hamster#4240: is it not?
 Yollie#2239: i forgot that this was 2 day not 3 day 💀
 ProtoXV#2705: Also a valuable skill to learn from a jam, I suppose
 sendhelpidfk#6700: that's the spirit
 Michel#2879: agrees
 Redline#7370: yollie moment also I'm making minecraft again
 Yollie#2239: but i still might be able to finish on time if i cut back on content
 Yollie#2239: I overscoped SO MUCH
 dave_ja#4419: Will delete when I've had coffee and reread it
 dave_ja#4419: Morning! Just leaving this here: A brain is just a 1,000,000+ sided dice. 🧐
 EwanGallagherWork#0395: Morning y'all
 LM#4371: I also want to add a literal roll of the dice
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: You gotta love it when your parents are like let's do something today and you are like oh god no I want to stay behind my pc.
 vell#4314: sounds good
 LM#4371: yeah, and when another event happens, previous event is removed
 Daniel's Lion#2240: the 1st game idea i had -> you have a giant dice in front of you and when you roll it a random room apears with a random challenge with the main objective being **SURVIVE**, I'll just roll with that 👈 unintended.
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Hello. Im back.
 vell#4314: like after x seconds the enimies become explosive ?
 LM#4371: By the way, my game is like 50% done now lol
not sure if its suiting the theme enough, but randomness is randomness
 LM#4371: or a blackout
 Kritical#4329: I havent even started making my game, now seems like a godd time to start
 LM#4371: explosive enemies
 smearyto#3143: My game looks horrible
 vell#4314: events ? what for example ?
 SpeedWolfy#3389: Oh! Or you are a dice, tossed in the face of Minmax player and need to score a critical hit!
 Russian posh cat support ukraine#6575: good luck i guess
 Kritical#4329: What even is sleep?
 LM#4371: i'm just making a game with random events every x seconds
 SpeedWolfy#3389: Someone needs to slep some more and dat someone is me :3
 Russian posh cat support ukraine#6575: game idea: the player is a dnd dice and the dice is rolling of a hill and you control the dice to not hit any obsticals
 quyteriyaki#6095: prism d4 🏃
 Kritical#4329: 6*
 SpeedWolfy#3389: Omg! A dice is also a 4 sided coin!
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: I was planing for yesterday whole night I'm alone
 sendhelpidfk#6700: honestly yeah, my main strategy for game jams is just to lean into whatever i come up with first
 Zayn#4390: Took a little break 🙂
 quyteriyaki#6095: shower thought:
a coin is just a two sided dice 🤔
 Daniel's Lion#2240: You've just given me some serious inspiration.
 Selviam#7268: my game is gonna be like a game where you have a dice and it rolls into other dice and whatever you roll on does the thing im too tired to explain this hhhh
 Russian posh cat support ukraine#6575: we were planning for 40 mins and we started the game idea
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: so now I will start with the pixel art
 sendhelpidfk#6700: i tried so hard to make something that wasn't a puzzle game and failed fairly miserably
at least it's planned to be more in the vein of zactronics so more engineering than anything but still
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: can mods participate?
 Russian posh cat support ukraine#6575: nice idea
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: Mine is a ghostbuster rpg-board game for 1 player
 Russian posh cat support ukraine#6575: same
 MCCV#1542: bet
 Henry_Hamster#4240: dying...
 Delphine Noel#1196: I will love to see non-puzzle games this jam
 Russian posh cat support ukraine#6575: how is everyone doing?
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: my movement prototype is finished. Shall I make a battle prototype or start making the game (I quess 2nd)
 LOPSTERu#3902: my game is gonna be horrible but im fine with that
 Arfilish#8729: i hate blender texturing tools
 Delphine Noel#1196: afternoon
 ^_^#9116: Morning
 Luuk37#7850: It is harder than I thought to do teamwork, I think I might even be better alone TBH
No regrets tho as I need teem experience anyways
 tykenn#8548: Character faces are too hard to model. The game needs a dice theme. These problems really just solve each other really well.
 Jolly Ask#0856: The real dice were the friends we made along the way (good morning all!)
 MrBen#0001: well every level gives you unexpected (just like roll of the dice) ability for ex. changes gravity, gives walljump, change bouciness, changes spikes behaviour...
 Vabenil#5485: Sleep usually helps your brain juices to start flowing
 sendhelpidfk#6700: ~~finally, a day where i'm glad i went for the permanent desktop license instead of the web one~~
 wren#0640: man I need to sleep so bad but I'm worried I'll lose puzzle design motivation when I wake up
 DarkFluo#1049: still, sound impressive ! good luck for the rest of the jam !
 Jaymaican#9295: Hey! I'm not sure where else to put this so I'll put it here, but I don't want anyone else going what I went through.
For people using Game Maker Studio 2, the most recent version is BROKEN for current Web/HTML5 exports which is what most people will probably be using for the Jam.
When the player swaps browser tabs the game will go completely black. This bug can be reproduced with 100% accurately and effects every game. Any HTML5 GMS2 exported in this version will have this bug.
The bug is known and is supposedly fixed for an upcoming version. The only way to avoid it is to revert back to version 2022.5.2.13.
Even if one person reads this, I hope it finds you well. 🙂
 MrBen#0001: I have just platformer game with different levels that give you different abilities
 quantum#0043: never thought jammin was that hard
 DarkFluo#1049: bro wat
You are already working on the puzzles ??? You already got the main mechanics ready ??? WOW
 Daniel's Lion#2240: i'm a beginner so it would take forever for me to make that, but thanks.
 Tornado#0975: man my artist is offline rn
 ⃟pu  ⃟rp  ⃟le  ⃟#1529: seems like a lot of game here includes literal dice
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: puzzle game creator
 sendhelpidfk#6700: god i still don't even have core mechanics implemented yet, i just started work on the build system
 MrBen#0001: wow man I made 9 puzzles so far 👀
 Daniel's Lion#2240: tried that, failed.
 sendhelpidfk#6700: one of the ones i didn't use is an rpg in which battle conditions (essentially universal status effects) are determined by dice that can be rerolled by either you or your opponent to aid you in combat, feel free to use it if it seems interesting/doable/etc. to you
 quantum#0043: my Rigidbody isntworking
 Selviam#7268: word association!
 Daniel's Lion#2240: Good Morning(On my side at least). might anyone here know some tricks on how to get a game idea in 30mins, I'm freaking out here.
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: I never got that far in development to use particles
 Chinwizard#2798: what naming suffix, if any, do y'all use for particles? I can't decide on one that feels right
 DarkFluo#1049: It's fine, though I feel like it could be faster... But I think I'm on a pretty good pace
 Galactum#6235: my game is very RNG heavy as of right now, but I have some ideas to fix that
 MCCV#1542: wow I finally have an idea now, that took  a while
 Zayn#4390: not me lmao
 Soup#3034: most of the people done are probably asleep rn
 Zayn#4390: Going good as of now.
 hehe boi#3720: Everyone seems to be making a random level generator
 Sheep777#3876: I am trying to make random level generator, but I forgot to do something and created an infinite monster that crashed unity
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: very good
 Zayn#4390: Got some pretty damn good progress 😁, I hope I'll finish in time
 Soup#3034: i made the movement, all but one of the animations, and most of the art for my game
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I woke up on time and people are, ofc, not done with their testbuilds so I'm still without a job XD
 DarkFluo#1049: okay well in that case, the player movement is the most important bit, so start by a moving cube, then the roll maybe, and finish it by adding every mechanic the player should have (well, everything that is relevant to gameplay, you can leave the graphics and stuff like that for later). Make sure the player is as fleshed out as possible in terms of mechanics (so like health, the roll, shooting if you need that). Then, I'd say implement the boss, by starting with the most important things and adding more mechanics one after the others
I hope that will help you
 quantum#0043: booo
 Giga chad#0085: great!
 Galactum#6235: How has progress been going for you all?
 Giga chad#0085: first time I used a foreach loop
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: shall I make a prototype battle system or dive in the true game
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: just finished my prototype dice system, seems cool tbh
 volksgeist84#2055: Good morning!
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Good morning to you aswell!
 Galactum#6235: good morning! :) (morning for me at least)
 farkon00#0500: Hmm, i just wrote first for loop in a game. I didnt make one in this whole project before. How??
 volksgeist84#2055: I have to flesh this out on paper. It's too similar to Enter The Gungeon in my head but still.
 volksgeist84#2055: I'm thankful for the guidance. I was thinking of a bullet-hell game with the player as a regular dice and with rolls being the dodge mechanic (I'd have to implement I-frames). I'd add with hexagonal dice as bosses and randomized bullet (numbers for bullets, maybe) patterns based on its roll. The spin time for the dice would give the player dice time to attack.
 KadDev#8100: Bruh I was supposed to wake up 4 hours ago!!!!!!!!!!!
 Michel#2879: I haven't slept yet
 Michel#2879: yeah same, I am newbie in Unity. But I still made something playable at least
 Giga chad#0085: respect man I its 9:40 am for me and I slept 4 hours
 Soup#3034: its almost 1 am for me so currently i havent slept
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Finally got throwing the dice sort of working
I'm definitely not going to finish the game, as I am learning the engine as I go, but my goal is to submit something playable at the end
And then finish it after the jam is done because I like the idea
 Dave_BBX#4939: can someone help in 
 Giga chad#0085: who slept more than 6 hours?
 DarkFluo#1049: well really, that depends on the game you are making. If it's a plateformer, make the player controller, if it's a shooter, make the player controller, then the shooting mechanic, if it's a puzzle game, then you should make your main mechanic. Other than that, I don't really think I can particularly help you without more details
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Hello
 Soup#3034: im pretty behind
 Soup#3034: lucky
 Redline#7370: actually I probably caught up to where I should be, maybe not losing time after all
 volksgeist84#2055: Right, that makes sense. Without the technical know-how, though, where would one go?
 quantum#0043: i dunno wat to do
 Snory#4231: One day I am going to hire someone who will be naming things for me
 DarkFluo#1049: welp, that's the end of my break, I'll get back to work for the next 2 hours and a half before noon. See ya and have a good night/morning !
 DarkFluo#1049: see ya ! Have a good night !
 Soup#3034: no sleeping allowed in game jam!!1!
 MrRoboman#9804: Good night! See you all in about 8 hours
 darlingS#1797: It is 3:33pm and I have been up since midnight. I am running off writing music and panel de pon
 hehe boi#3720: I just enjoy jams and don't push myself
 MrRoboman#9804: I'm playing with my prototype but i need to go to bed
 DarkFluo#1049: if you have the complete idea, I'd start working on the main concept of the game first. make sure it's fun and solid
 hehe boi#3720: I have 6 hours of work usually
 KadDev#8100: NOOO I OVERSLEPT
 MrRoboman#9804: Same
 GameDude#3494: It's actually 12:30 AM for me, midnight
 DarkFluo#1049: 9:30 on my end, I got about an hour and a half of work
 hehe boi#3720: Player controller
 hehe boi#3720: It's 830 am fir me so I just woke up lol
 volksgeist84#2055: Hi, total rando here who hasn't built or even mimicked a game here. If any of you were me, where would you start?
 williamdoro#8857: i do 9 hour long for my session, 3 hours until i hit 9 hours
 krill#0212: I'm gonna go do that right now hahaha
 Capybara#8868: i am now in italy and choking on my own spaghett
 DarkFluo#1049: I'm doing A-Okay. I'm taking a short break, but progress is coming along. It's a bit janky, but I got something alright !
 hehe boi#3720: Sleep is very important. Make sure you have some
 darlingS#1797: I have somehow peaked with my boss fight song writing for a game jam about dice. I have been up since the theme was announced
 hehe boi#3720: Very good thanks, how about you?
 krill#0212: 14 hour long session. This is fine, sleep is for the weak /s 🥲
 DarkFluo#1049: hello ! how are you doing ?
 hehe boi#3720: Hey everyone!
 DarkFluo#1049: nice ! Sounds like you are on a good pace !
 theChief#0001: Got a fun rng based powerup system, and health/shielding. Going to add the rhythm based shooting after I've had some breakfast
 DarkFluo#1049: same dude... same...
 williamdoro#8857: i'm begging my mom for an ipad air lol
 Zayn#4390: I've done about 2 hours of work lmao
 Redline#7370: **chaos.**
 Kick14#5790: I haven't started yet
 DarkFluo#1049: okay I need a 5min break. How everyone doing ? is everything coming along nicely ?
 williamdoro#8857: im on 6 hours
 Zayn#4390: Shoot Unity Crashed 😭
 theChief#0001: Baby woke up at 4:30 so I took him downstairs to let my wife catch up on sleep
 theChief#0001: It's 8:26am and I've already done 3 hours of work 😂
 RomketMan#0055: Good morning
 darlingS#1797: Afternoon
 Woum#5790: Morning morning
 PepperBoi#4544: If your game isnt scuffed are you even jamming
 Sploky#9103: My game is about to be very scuffed
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: Sure just throw it in my general direction and I'll stand outside and catch it
 SpeedWolfy#3389: lul same
 Hederlunden#3231: sure bro, could have some extra ram
 GameDude#3494: That's cool. Wow. Ideas can get so different and wild with just a few words.
 Hederlunden#3231: My game has rng, yes, but that's not the main thing that determines if you win, brain power does
 VulpineMachine#2173: Anyone need extra RAM? I have a bit to spare... XD
 PepperBoi#4544: I have no idea how to continue this with the gmtk theme lul
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: who is eating my ram?
it's discord!
quess I'll close it
 VulpineMachine#2173: I did go with randomizer, but it randomizes genre and/or perspective elements depending on where you're at in the narrative.
 SpeedWolfy#3389: How dice tha bastard...
 Bankio is 👑#0754: Cya!
 GameDude#3494: Thank you. I thought few people actually really thought deep into that and most instead went with "RNG" or "normal game with a randomizer".
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: so bruh real
 Hederlunden#3231: arent we all?
 PepperBoi#4544: I'm listening to Hamilton tbh
 Quentincroyable#5223: See you later guys, gotta start working now, good luck or good night to y'all :D
 Crusher48#2092: I went with the "you can move your dice to control which face they end up on" and I'm going to try to mix it with some positioning-based combat between dice
 Arleycht#7791: this is my first and im using it merely as motivation to get a finished product out ^^
 Bankio is 👑#0754: Same with me
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: I'm freaked out this is my first gmtk
 Wolf'1988 🐺⚔#1859: Just take gam jam as a experience. My games never look good but they improve each time and i learn more about myself as i do them
 VulpineMachine#2173: I was genuinely hoping someone would do something like this tbh. This makes me happy.
 Bankio is 👑#0754: Not really
 Piotrek4#6196: I havent started yet
 theChief#0001: Don't compare your game to other games! This isn't a competition ☺️
 GameDude#3494: I'm actually doing the opposite here. The dice in my game is a sentinent, rigged dice (that isn't random at all, rolls at constant speed) that can control its own fate (meaning you can always get the correct number with the right moves) rebelling against a casino owner. Each jammer has their own personal interpretation I guess.
 Hederlunden#3231: well you can improve it right?
 wren#0640: pretty happy with that tbh
 Bankio is 👑#0754: My game looks terrible compared to everyone elses
 wren#0640: ok i currently have about 2 minutes of gameplay and thats with knowing the solutions to all the puzzles
 Zayn#4390: yeah I guess lul
 VulpineMachine#2173: Our concept doesn't have any dice whatsoever, but it does deal with probability as a central theme and it heavily affects both the story and the play mechanics.
 Hederlunden#3231: well i had sleep in between but yeah
 Hederlunden#3231: finally done prototyping on paper lmao
 theChief#0001: I don't necessarily agree - the theme implementation doesn't have to be the obvious "dice" interpretation. Roll of the dice is a saying that basically means "take a chance", so you could interpret that to be any form of rng really. You could also do it thematically, and make a game about someone who took a big risk
 Lukey#6052: Woo! My basic prototype idea is looking very fun and very juicy, I cannot wait to expand upon this. (Wayyy better than my other idea)
 VulpineMachine#2173: TBF tho, I absolutely love the concept we came up with and I might wanna work on this long long after the jam is over.
 WaveParadigm#0001: nah but you can submit your project whenever and continually update the actual game page - saves a *ton* of stress not having to deal with building the page last minute
 Dodo#8091: I've had yesterday the last exam of uni session. So tired to start this I think... But maybe I've got a nice idea
 Zayn#4390: wtf ur already done???
 Bankio is 👑#0754: I dk
 steeleater#7580: trying is what it's all about, man
 GameDude#3494: That's sad to hear. Hope you make something great though!
 Quentincroyable#5223: Aren't you your everyday present ?
 VulpineMachine#2173: I'm the only one taking care of my 3 sons, one is a T1D, one has hyperinsulinism, and one is 8 months old. So even on a good day I'm being run through the ringer...man...I've made so little progress so far. I've tried, I really have, but damn...
 GameDude#3494: A good game that fits the theme is surprisingly difficult to make in just 48 hours. Dice is especially hard to think of good ideas with. I just went with a rigged casino dice (that rolls at constant speed) instead.
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: pov: you leave the chat for some seconds
*999 pings*
 Bankio is 👑#0754: Wait im making myself a present?
 TheChronicPhenix#1205: I might not have a game at the end of the jam, but, the super barebones stuff that does exist should be fun
 Bankio is 👑#0754: Yep
 Quentincroyable#5223: Same here, we wrote down the game yesterday, today is working time
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: just started yolo I sleeped yesterday
 Eternal Hunter#4259: you know what's kinda funny, I run unity on a potato from 2011 and I very rarely crash, although I can't run the latest version of unity :/
 Redline#7370: good thing that I'm spamming ctrl+s everytime I click a button
 GameDude#3494: Been making the game for 12 hours non stop already, still cannot stop, too much to add lol
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: your gift will be the ~~bad~~ awesome games we and you will make
 TheChronicPhenix#1205: Haha too true
 theChief#0001: It's the true game jam experience!
 Pyth0n#0572: evry so often i hit fn instead of ctrl and i have to quit the code without saving
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: don't worry I saved
 Bankio is 👑#0754: Fuck indeed
 Zayn#4390: fuck
 TheChronicPhenix#1205: Just hearing about these crashes and lost bits of progress is stressing lol
 Pyth0n#0572: my sister's bday is today
 Bankio is 👑#0754: Today is my last day working on the jam cause my birthdays tormorrow:/
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: no it's a classic one, when you attach a script there is a 20% chance of it f**kin your project
 theChief#0001: I just lost about 10 mins of work because my laptop died and I hadn't saved the scene lol
 Pyth0n#0572: try learning python and pygame for next year, its what im doing for this jam
 Dave_BBX#4939: i have to reinstall the unity version : (
 Eternal Hunter#4259: rip, that takes forever, f to pay respects
 Bankio is 👑#0754: My birthday is tormorrow aswell so bad timing for me.
 theChief#0001: Welcome to unity dev 😉
 Zayn#4390: PANIC EVERYBODY PANIC!!!
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: oh no unity crashed I have to reload it
 Zayn#4390: haha
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: I use it. It's quick to work in and limited enough it sort of focuses you
 Quentincroyable#5223: It doesn't seem like you really have a choice then wether scratch is "good" or not haha
 Bankio is 👑#0754: Ive only ever used scratch so i can only use it for this game jam cause i woudnt have time to learn anything else
 Ðazed♡#8249: but thats my opinion
 Ðazed♡#8249: tbh pico 8 is good for jams i think
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: idk better use a game engine like unity or godot or even pico-8
 Quentincroyable#5223: You'll know when playing it, don't hesitate to ask people around to playtest as well to have some feedbacks later on
 Bankio is 👑#0754: Is scratch good to use?
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: the thing is I talked with my friends bout the idea and then I thought (will this be fun?) seems like it is!
 Quentincroyable#5223: For someone talking about having a bad idea, it seems you have tought about it quite well already, good luck and more importantly, have fun :)
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: that still good!
also it will be 2d pixel art!
Another idea is that in some rooms ghost may replace your dice so you have higher boss battle chances
 Quentincroyable#5223: Well if you didn't get any sleep yet, whatever what time it is, it still feels like a good checkpoint to rest, but 9am here for me
 Shadow the Dragon#6927: It's 2 am for me, lol. *Iiii* am gonna get some sleep.
 Quentincroyable#5223: I mean, you could throw an additional dice just for the encounter but that's up to you to see if it's fun, try having your gameplay loop first
 Dave_BBX#4939: i start now 😆
 Ðazed♡#8249: its only 4:59 pm rn where i am
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: But still not a bad idea
 Quentincroyable#5223: Ooh pretty neat, a good checkpoint to have some sleep I'd say
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: if you haven't got a game yet then you don't need to be worrying about shaders. Go make something and see how far you get
 arguingjaguar#5819: i woke up late and lost 12 hours of time
 Tornado#0975: do i upload the game to webgl or no webgl is pretty slow ?? atleast on my wifi
 Ðazed♡#8249: i feel like most my game is done tbh
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: Because one number of the normal dice will have boss fight
 ﷽﷽#8924: I don't have time for game jam.
Oof.
 Quentincroyable#5223: congrats
 arguingjaguar#5819: hi
 Tornado#0975: oh. ahhhh thats a big problem
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: remember shader graph doesn't really work with webgl aparently
 Quentincroyable#5223: Seems like a good idea, If I may, I'd ask why hardcode 40 % when you could throw a 10faces dice and if result <= 4 then fight ? (allows you to change the numbers and it's a dice, nice setting for a boardgame)
 Tornado#0975: its better to be able to use shadergraph else not use it
 Ðazed♡#8249: lesgooo i finally got this one thing fixed!!
 Tornado#0975: hmm yes shader graph
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: scope small, better to finish than to run out of time
 Subwoofer#0066: we think we're being a liiiittle ambitious but its nothin a few red bulls cant fix
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: if you want lots of bloom and effects etc then use URP
 Tornado#0975: ill start making the game from now. ahhhhhhhhhhhhh i dont really know i am going for cyberpunk arcade theme
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: dude if one people like this more than me and my friend I'm making something cool. Gotta start the prototype!!!
 CM69Time#0494: Default
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: that depends what you need
 Pyth0n#0572: and im not just saying that to motivate u
 Tornado#0975: should i use URP in my 2d GAME Or Default
 Glitch#1483: Probably Unity.
 Quentincroyable#5223: Stay strong haha
 Pyth0n#0572: im a huge fan of pokemon so id play this
 Zayn#4390: haha!
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: nice
you will have tasks to do and every time you roll the dice to move you will have a 40% chance entering a battle, where you can either catch or kill  the ghost
 Subwoofer#0066: i am soooooo new to working this hard hahahah
 Pyth0n#0572: actually sounds cool
 Bankio is 👑#0754: Yep
 Quentincroyable#5223: Either try and make your idea work, might be fun when some gameplay is in then trim down if there's too much to focus on the fun or try some brainstorming techniques to have some new ideas
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: I thought of a board game-rpg with ghosts
 Zayn#4390: Nice
 Zayn#4390: Yup 🙂
 quantum#0043: i remeber you i was vector
 Pyth0n#0572: sure
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: Can I say what my idea is?
 Quentincroyable#5223: Ealry enough to switch ideas, better know now that it sucks than tomorrow, good luck mate
 Redline#7370: ah yes you changed your pfp
 L1ttel_Y#7220: Playing safe so probably no need for 2 whole days
 Zayn#4390: Ah Redline I remember u, from brackeys game jam
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: yes but I talked with some friends
 Pyth0n#0572: run with it. you'll be supried by how well it turns out
 Redline#7370: yea I'm switching this isn't going too well
 Quentincroyable#5223: Working alone ?
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: I have no idea help
 Quentincroyable#5223: Lol don't forget to live tho, I already wish you a good rest for when it's finished
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: guys help I only have 1 idea and I don't think it's good
 SpeedWolfy#3389: Its never wrong to be kind)
 Zayn#4390: I see alot of people here motivating others 😄 I like it!
 Redline#7370: I might switch to one of my other ideas since I'm feeling that I'm not gonna be able to finish my current one or it doesn't feel that great tbh
 Shadow the Dragon#6927: I set aside basically everything else in my life to basically just zero-in on making this. *I am gonna have heavy creative burn-out come Sunday lol.*
 Quentincroyable#5223: Well at least you got gameplay, there's still plenty of time to make it fun !
 Zayn#4390: lol
 farkon00#0500: I am only making first location of 5 needed and made 1 boss of 5. And i planned to do 6(because dice), but then i had an idea how to not add so much content. You got 6 - reroll
 Bankio is 👑#0754: Not the best.  My gameplay feels boring
 L3mmy♡#2307: First time taking part in the GMTK, not the biggest fan of big game jams but I'll see how it goes
Granted I have participated 11th time in another, smaller game jam
 japson#4917: ouh nice one, loads of time to polish is always nice
 Quentincroyable#5223: Damn boy, fast worker here
 Bankio is 👑#0754: I like the idea alot aswell! What engine are you gonna make this with?
 Shadow the Dragon#6927: Pretty good, probably 45-50% completed and going to sleep soon.
 Quentincroyable#5223: Just woke up lol Let switch places then
 japson#4917: aw what's happening ? you still got plenty of time !
 Bankio is 👑#0754: Completed!
 Shadow the Dragon#6927: Fourth time taking part in the GMTK Game Jam (took part in 2019, 2020, and 2021.) Hoping to make a better game this time around then what I did previous years.
 Fraserfatt#1021: boutta go to bed lmao
 Zayn#4390: bad
 japson#4917: Good morning y'all, how's the game jam going for you so far? 😄
 Snory#4231: After an hour i have a die face rotation 😄
 Glitch#1483: Sorry
 Snory#4231: As I am attending only game james while my regural job is database developer, it really takes long to make a simple thing. 😄
 Merus#7019: also, this sort of thing is why we've disabled embeds
 Mark Brown#6982: This is not the time/place for such a thing, sorry!
 Pygocentrus#8974: I submitted a answer earlier
 Glitch#1483: Thankyou! It is really helping.
 Merus#7019: we have reluctantly accepted that people are going to ping Mark regardless of whether or not there's a rule, but also: he's got stuff to do, and there's a whole community to talk to
 Bankio is 👑#0754: I will do it
 Zayn#4390: Ah finally I got collisions to work
 Pygocentrus#8974: It doesn't appear to be a rule here just saying
 Firepixel85#0733: no good
 L3mmy♡#2307: Pretty crappy, got like 6h of sleep instead of a good 7h...
 Pygocentrus#8974: It's a regular rule to just not ping owners of a server
 Firepixel85#0733: good to hear
 Pyth0n#0572: went 2 bed @ 10, woke up @ 5
 farkon00#0500: Nice. Woke up a 2 hours earlier then usual
 Tapu#9161: I haven't even started 💀
 Omegnight#7081: Music and sfx is something I keep for tomorrow
 Firepixel85#0733: To all my European jammers how did everyone sleep
 farkon00#0500:  No embeds Sadge. I wanted to post meme about my drawing skills with random bullcrap go
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: Time for my favourite part of the game jam: Going through music and sound effects to choose the right ones
 L3mmy♡#2307: Hows everyone going ? Ready to work on their game for the second day in a row ?
 Redline#7370: happy jam hours
 Soup#3034: im not gonna do anything crazy for the dice part, im making a platformer where you shoot dice at enemies to do a random amount of damage based on the type (d6, d20, etc.)
 Chris10EMX#5180:  What's your favorite game of all time?
 MrBen#0001: man 100+ new messages in 
 Fraserfatt#1021: that's a lotta levels
 Chris10EMX#5180: Same here, just started the random part
 MrBen#0001: I was working for 5 hours and i have 9 levels :)
 Pyth0n#0572: You should, its a great time
 Soup#3034: ive been working for 13 hrs and i havent even done the dice part
 Mark Brown#6982: never played DnD!
 Zayn#4390: I'll just use 3D Collision in a 2D Game D:
 Bankio is 👑#0754: I just woke up and i dont feel like doing the jam
 Pyth0n#0572:   was the whole reason u picked the theme because u got into DnD?
 Soup#3034: ive basically only done art and movement
 Zayn#4390: this is my first time making a 2D Game and I cant even get collisions to work AAHA ;p
 Zayn#4390: Same man 😭
 K'miinik#3171: honestly I don't think i'm gonna be able to get anything done
 nekotheasparagus#0809: Thank
 darlingS#1797: You don't have time and it isn't worth the pressure
 nekotheasparagus#0809: Boo you stole my first idea /joke
 wren#0640: *join ussss*
 nekotheasparagus#0809: Someone please snap me out of my sudden idea to learn how to use Godot for this jam
 Sapient#3138: d6 but its like d2
 Pyth0n#0572: d2
 Sapient#3138: Even means gravity remains same , odd means gravity reverses
 Mattstov(Matt) ⃤#8596: 2:25 am still goin strong :)
 Pyth0n#0572: ive decided im gonna have a city in my dnd campaign with funky gravity, the players need to do something to stop the city's gravity from returning to normal and collapsing in on itself
 Chris10EMX#5180: 😂
 darlingS#1797: Ducktales moon theme plays as you curse your d20
 Chris10EMX#5180: I mean it would be funny
 Pyth0n#0572: 'make a dex saving throw'
'i rolled a 1'
'...
you shoot-up into the sky as if gravity was reversed'
 MrBen#0001: aw man. good night sleep
 Sinci1#2994: maybe not being able to stop moving for a short period of time would work too idk
 NoelJasik#8768: Just try it out, and check if it's fun
 NoelJasik#8768: Could work
 Chris10EMX#5180: Do you think different gravity would be fun?
 Chris10EMX#5180: Definitely, thanks, man.
 K'miinik#3171: A concept I've been sorta thinking of, is *Role* of the dice, thinking about what role the dice play in a given game, like in a card game they're usually just used as a counter to keep track of things, etc.
 Sinci1#2994: see I'm thinking of a little mini theory that perhaps the movement debuff is annoying mainly if there's no way to counter-play it.
When you slowdown the player no matter what you do the player will move slowly.
But a pogo stick or an ice thing, the player if they have enough skill can circumvent it and pass the level.
Idk if my theory holds up tho
 NoelJasik#8768: Try doing stuff that would force a diffrent playstyle rather than put the player at a disadvantage
 Chris10EMX#5180: No health system, if they die they die (respawn)
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: Making certain buttons not work can be an interesting debuff if done correctly (Need to do the next bit without jumping or something)
 quantum#0043: oops i got a new idea time to start over
 rhythm heaven monkey#9052: i might pick the game back up tomorrow if i feel like it, or i might work on other things or just do some activities requiring no mental effort like i normally do
 NoelJasik#8768: Lower move speed, basically slowing down gameplay for you doesn't really add variety and makes it more frustrating to play
 Sinci1#2994: I see, anything else tho?
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: Anything that freezes the character for a period of time gives me the urge to chuck my controller through a window
 Chris10EMX#5180: You are right I thought of increased and  reduced speed but worried that players would get frustrated
 AZOTh the Creator#7094: getting damaged based on distance u move
if ur game has health system🤔
 spwn_srujan#1445: Reverse controls
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: Dice based territory control board game with dumb AI
 Sinci1#2994: what movement based debuffs would you consider annoying?
 Chris10EMX#5180: Thanks
 Sinci1#2994: I'm not sure I understand, like you realized you have other projects you'd rather work on or something else since I'm a bit confused by your "I have no persistence" comment
 NoelJasik#8768: Movement based debuffs often might feel more annoying than actually giving you a hard time tbh, but something like floor is ice, or you have to constantly pogo jump could be cool
 Worio#6432: That's nice! Good job!
 rhythm heaven monkey#9052: but in 2 hours i successfully...made dice that roll with physics
 wren#0640: god I haven't read scott pilgrim in so long I like barely got this lol
 darlingS#1797: Speed, floaty/weighty jumps
 Tail#3389: videogames
 Spacespy#5949: Sadly dropping out, I’ve fell ill and don’t think I can keep up with the strict timer
 SpeedWolfy#3389: did you know, that pacman...
 Chris10EMX#5180: Thinking about movement-based debuffs, enemies, and obstacles any ideas
 FryDev#0372: why can’t I just not sleep
 rhythm heaven monkey#9052: realised i wanted to do other things
i have no persistence
 Sinci1#2994: bro well maybe not with that attitude, remember why you're doing this jam in the first place, maybe that'll help with your motivation
 wren#0640: yooo mae pfp
 Zayn#4390: I think I might not be able to finish my game 😭 I just started it and im already de-motivated
 Sinci1#2994: wait why'd you give up? 😢
 FryDev#0372: can’t believe that I have to sleep now
 dardasaba#9759: Yup! It's 09:00 here, gonna eat some breakfast and then get jamming! :)
 AZOTh the Creator#7094: 3pm here and my part time job just finished
lets hustle guys!
 rhythm heaven monkey#9052: i gave up after 2 hours ._.
sadly that's the best i've ever done
 Zoro5168#0115: Dude same
 SpeedWolfy#3389: Remember, dis people will sleep and by morning they'll see your amazing progress!
 dardasaba#9759: I kinda feel bad seeing all these already-good-looking games in  and stuff, seeing as I still didn't do anything (except for coming up with an idea)... Oh well, sleep is a necessary thing xD
 dardasaba#9759: Alright, woke up fresh and ready to work on the idea I came up with while trying to sleep: Get Your Dye Off My Die! :)
 Taccos#1054: my 3d controller and my gun system are ready, time to work on the main mechanic now
 Sheep777#3876: t̶͒̑h̶͛͠a̸͒̆n̸̅̅k̷̽̊ṡ̶͒
 SpeedWolfy#3389: Fcourse! Take a bite from our shared 4th dimension
 Worio#6432: Yes, we all may, just a bit though
 Sheep777#3876: may i have some soup?
 SpeedWolfy#3389: Time is a weird soup
 Sinci1#2994: 8am here
 TheChronicPhenix#1205: Top-down/isometric shooter, similar concepts to other people with randomized weapons as you move
 Giga chad#0085: bruh its 6AM for me rn
 Zayn#4390: same...
 Sheep777#3876: same
 Sinci1#2994: I forgot about different timezones for a sec, for me it's mornin
 Sheep777#3876: Making a top down shooter with random levels and abilities and stuff
 Worio#6432: So much variety! Cool, all of you!
 tykenn#8548: multiversal escape room
 SpeedWolfy#3389: Also first jammer, trying to do a simple runner with dicey controls
 Fraserfatt#1021: silly lil fps
 Dacks#5654: Good ol top down shooter
 Vabenil#5485: I'm doing a city builder
 Worio#6432: Oh cool! Well good luck! :)
 LOPSTERu#3902: it's also my first jam! Im trying to make a platformer
 Worio#6432: Anyway what are you guys working on? I'm making a text adventure game (since this is my first jam and I just wanna get a feel to how this all works)
 Tapu#9161: midday here
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Its midnight
 Agentlion#1893: Thank you!
 Ricky#5210: Second Unreal crash of the night, let’s gooooo
 Worio#6432: Thank you and good morning to you!
 Agentlion#1893: Good morning to those just getting up
 Zayn#4390: bruh out of the context
 pixal#1121: Is there a grid system to plant trees?
 sendhelpidfk#6700: idk just put them in fixed locations for now and deal with it later
 Ðazed♡#8249: i should maybe get someone to do music stuffs soon tho
 sendhelpidfk#6700: ah
 Ðazed♡#8249: ye
 Vabenil#5485: I think they meant putting the trees in the game world in random locations
 Ðazed♡#8249: thats the thing, my games based in a command promp type thing
 sendhelpidfk#6700: ~~just use a fake png ez~~ make one nice tree and use it for everything then
 Ðazed♡#8249: f it im making it so the player has to plant their own trees, too lazy to write code for randomly generated trees 🤷
 sendhelpidfk#6700: reduce scope as much as you can get away with while keeping the game fun, or at minimum maintaining the core of what makes your game work
 Ðazed♡#8249: im starting to wonder why im making the game i am seeing the jam length
 Sinci1#2994: 3Dice actually sounds like a... name, make it a 3D game about three dices made of ice
 Constantine#3716: ☜(ˆ▿ˆc)
 Zayn#4390: Alright something works
 Sinci1#2994: 6Dice
 pixal#1121: How about 6D
 sendhelpidfk#6700: you see, the trick is that i barely know either
 Constantine#3716: the main thing i've learned today is that unity's isometric tilesets are quite finicky
 tykenn#8548: A name like "3d...6" would fit this jam
 pixal#1121: Idk what you're saying but yeah
 sendhelpidfk#6700: also beseitigen slaps ~~even though it's technically not actually _in_ any wipeout games so technically it doesn't fit the bill for 'spamming wipeout music' but close enough~~
 Fraserfatt#1021: good thing dice are involved
 pixal#1121: Just put 3D in the name
 Sinci1#2994: 2.5D games are my (game) jam, kinda, idk
 Azurezero#4851: its fake 3d
 zyugyzarc#0314: all my assets are cubes lmao
 sendhelpidfk#6700: because of some conflux of adhd and being on the spectrum i operate best while overstimulating myself in a controlled manner, and loud music happens to be a good way to do it
 Panda S#8673: imagine making 3d game
 Lukey#6052: oooo yes ragdolls are incredible
 Merus#7019: dying is not against the server rules but we do want you to look after yourself! Take breaks! Get sleep! Eat healthy food! Cut that feature!
 zyugyzarc#0314: ragdolls are even better
 pixal#1121: I have just learnt to ignore the surrounding noise
 Lukey#6052: rigidbodies and everything do go well together
 zyugyzarc#0314: rigidbodies and dice do go well together
 Lukey#6052: OOO and with my new idea I can also use my favourite thing! *Rigidbodys*
 sendhelpidfk#6700: the corsair void elite is shockingly good at blocking bg noise and i haven't felt like messing with icue any more than necessary for the past two years or however long i've had this thing
 Rav#3300: Please refrain from dying as it is illegal to die here
 Azurezero#4851: i thought i finally had it working but adding textures to my dice model revealed the rotation is reset before every roll
 pixal#1121: It might make gamejam famous though
 zyugyzarc#0314: how's everyone's jam going?
 Merus#7019: also we would not like you to die
 Rav#3300: What the heck what kind giant of amp do you have? Lol
 sendhelpidfk#6700: i'll consider it
 Merus#7019: for one thing, it will make it much more difficult to submit your game
 Sinci1#2994: true
 Merus#7019: please do not die during the game jam
 sendhelpidfk#6700: minor detail
 Capybara#8868: also you are actually going to die
 Gradient O'Games#3913: you don't always have to make something never-before-seen, Im making some sort of binding of issac thing
 Capybara#8868: exactly so noise complaint
 Lukey#6052: gah I need to get a job so I can be a patreon supporter lol
 Merus#7019: try 
 sendhelpidfk#6700: 6% is already enough to just hear it while the headset is resting on a desk, and i have it set to 25% rn
 Tejas._.chichkar#7304: Hey guys ... Well if there's any team who wants a designer or tester reach out to me ... I won't be able to work as programmer coz of I'm not that good at it (*in unity engine)... But would like to be part of a team :)
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: do it then
 sendhelpidfk#6700: headset
 FryDev#0372: I should sleep
 Capybara#8868: noise complaint?
 sendhelpidfk#6700: current plan to finish progress for tonight is just to play music from wipeout games at probably unsafe volumes and speedrun programming the game's main mechanic
 pixal#1121: Yeah
 Zoro5168#0115: Guys how to design your own board game
 Corbit#6029: Thanks mate!
 Rav#3300: Against some kids? You mean with?
 Zayn#4390: oh fuck
 Hemanth#9173: i haven't started yet 'cause i can't think of ideas 😞
feck it I'm gonna just make a top down shooter
 pixal#1121: Well one of my worst experience was teaming up with some kids(I don't have anything against them), who had like tone of ideas by no actual way on how to achieve it, not to mention they had no skills.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I mean that's been my advise for the last leek lol
 TheGameShePlays#7762: Finishing up for the first day, all scenes done (minus extra props and tidying if I have any time) and the basic setup is in place - tomorrow I have to actually add things beyond a player who can walk around!
 Zayn#4390: I knew all the steps, but I just didn't make the itch page, I am a master of making itch pages lmao
 Sinci1#2994: true now that you mention it I think maybe a good tip would be to make an itch io page before hand, upload a test build, then when you finish the game in full just switch out the test build for the real build
 Zayn#4390: :[ please show me
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: This is why we suggest making an itch page beforehand and practicing how to get a game uploaded
 Lukey#6052: WOOOOO! New idea, credit to my mum for giving me some ideas :D I'm now gonna restart with a lovely interesting idea that's easy to implement!!! All the things I wanted in an idea :D
Also, sorry I will not be sharing my idea because I just absolutely love it :]
 Zayn#4390: Last time I joined a jam there was a fking 2 hour **"POWER CUT"** when there was only 2 hours and 30 minutes remaining and when the electricity came back I only legit had 30 mins to playtest, level design, and MAKE A ITCH PAGE
 Rav#3300: Now i got traumas, so i won't forget to make it public
I guess it works that way too
 pixal#1121: Well I explained it to the mods, and they allowed me to make changes
 Rav#3300: The game was like, WAAAYYYY too ambitious too, expecially as first timers, but I guess we learned from it
 Ðazed♡#8249: tbh i like my idea
tho making it is pain
 Zayn#4390: nice! It will help u further in the development
 Rav#3300: At least you submit the game tho, didn't you? We ended up not submitting the game because we were last minute, and didn't know that we needed to make it public
 pixal#1121: Step 10 - "Ok I'll reflect on my mistakes next time"
 Zayn#4390: this happened to me last time lmfao
 LOPSTERu#3902: already have done that step
 Zayn#4390: thats what always happens to me every time sadly 😦
 pixal#1121: Dude, my every jam goes like this, last minute build fails, incorrect build options, zero play tests
 Zayn#4390: Step 9 - "Realize your game fking sucks"
 Rav#3300: Ohhhhh shut the f
My first game jam went like this
 Sinci1#2994: don't give up like see the two messages I've sent to coolness7423, maybe they can help you out too?
 pixal#1121: Step 8 - "fuck I forgot to make the page public"
 ZorroTamalito#0956: ah, funny
you can't paste images here?
 LOPSTERu#3902: finished making the mechanics, now i need to design the all the levels great and make the art
 Sinci1#2994: or actually what would you like to create an idea based off of? if my question is confusing basically like do you wanna figure out the theme first, the gameplay first, the aesthetic first, or like idk
 Michel#2879: Only cover photo left but i am bored
 Rav#3300: Step 7 - "Wait how do I upload a game again?"
 Lukey#6052: Step 6 - Go back to Step 1 and restart again
 Zayn#4390: Dont give up.
 grong dong bongle#6426: welp, had a good run gamers, but i have had zero ideas at all :(
 pixal#1121: Step 5 - make an itch page
 Rav#3300: Step 4 - go back because step 3 didn't work
 ZorroTamalito#0956: RIP
 Sinci1#2994: if you need help with ideas I think a good method is to list a bunch of random things, then look at the list and see if you can combine anything on the list to create a cool game
 Coolness7423#9624: I would have to get my brother to help he loves music
 Lukey#6052: Step 3 - figure out Step 4
 tykenn#8548: If you have some ideas you can't choose between, it may be fitting to decide on one via die roll
 Unclouded#9240: or something music related in general
 Rav#3300: 69 or 420?
Or I dunno, 1337 if you're old
 Zayn#4390: I haven't even started my game aah
 pixal#1121: Step 1- write down all your ideas
Step 2 - cut it into half
 Unclouded#9240: you can do something jazz related
 farkon00#0500: So it will be 100% extended
 Zayn#4390: oh no, im so far behind
 Coolness7423#9624: mhm
 FryDev#0372: do you need an idea?
 Lukey#6052: Ok, I'm going to restart. This time with proper care and planning to make sure I get a good interesting (yet simple and low-scope) idea. Then I'll catch up on the 12 hours I spent making a sad sloppy game.
 farkon00#0500: Kinda the same, but at least i did smth like boss, i need 6 of those. And 6 locations. Why dices dont have 3 sides, i dont care that its impossible.
 Merus#7019: is it higher or lower than one of the numbers the internet inexplicably still finds funny
 Coolness7423#9624: guys help idk what to do for the game jam
 FryDev#0372: welp, guess it’s sleepy time
 Mark Brown#6982: Yes, the timer will always be extended if Itch has a huge hissy fit
 Sinci1#2994: that's awesome
 ZorroTamalito#0956: I'm going nowhere with my game, even thought I have an idea of what to build XD
 FryDev#0372: it’s amazing how I felt so dreaded for several hours when I couldn’t come up with an idea and was fully ready to throw in the towel, and now I’m just excited because I have an idea
 Merus#7019: we do have contingencies for this, but that's also why there's a good spread of time for people to submit, so hopefully itch.io's servers don't get too overloaded
 Sinci1#2994: yo awesome, I don't have any yet but I did only am only now about to actually start working, I forgot the jam starts yesterday and as I went to sleep I remembered so now that it's the next day I'll see if I can make anything.
What's your new idea tho if you wanna share [if not that's understandable lol]
 birdstone#3073: my computer crashed LOL
 FryDev#0372: the trusty top down shooter, can’t go wrong with it
 tykenn#8548: Okay, time to fill 101559956668416 rooms up with interesting stuff
 Msipp#6059: if not i'll just go back to the top-down shooter
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Do you know how many are in so far?
 CommanderJersey#4816: Keeping ideas simple has been really hard for this theme lol
 Msipp#6059: hundreds but i can't make any but i do  have a new idea that shouldn't take too long
 Sheep777#3876: Im sure it did say that if itch crashes, they will figure something out i think
 FryDev#0372: my idea is an endless western shooter where you pair up dice to get snake eyes
 Merus#7019: that's why there's a two hour grace period: jam ends two hours before
 ballfun#5808: no
 Sinci1#2994: yo everyone hope you're all doing well, anyone got any ideas yet?
 Msipp#6059: new idea for the 5th time in the morning, this one SUPER simple
 FryDev#0372: I don’t have much done, so I pretty much have to make the whole game tomorrow
 PepperBoi#4544: What if itch crashes again
 Zoro5168#0115: Good morning guys, hows progress going
 Msipp#6059: but i waited too long to find a team but i did see something that made me reconsider everything
 quantum#0043:  ok
 Mark Brown#6982: So submit early and update often 😉
 Mark Brown#6982: There are no late submissions this year - there's a built-in two hour grace period. If you miss that you miss the jam!
 SkinnerSpace#8418: Same thing, it's time to quit :/
 absolutelyivy#3850: don't hinder yourself based on someone else's expectations!!!! comparison will do you no good, you should just focus on making something you enjoy
 Msipp#6059: i'd love to just work with someone who can make my ideas that WERE good come to life
 SkyBrave#1435: so don't worry, you still have time
 SkyBrave#1435: after 12 hours... I just found a somewhat "interesting" idea rn
 quantum#0043: What can I do if I havent submitted the game till the deadline?
 Msipp#6059: liteaerlly i saw someone else making the same idea but better i''m not just being negative aghhhhhhhhh
 Mark Brown#6982: Submissions are hidden until the voting period begin
 Yuw#1591: just quitted, the theme is very  good but can't figure out a simple game out of it, i have only complex ideas in mind.
But i had a very good idea for a non jam game, ill make a mini-prototype for that instead
 Msipp#6059: i'm too far in to change my idea and now i can't and it's just gonna be a worse version of something someone else is making
 LordCthuluke#1523: Its myself - an 18 year old (currently at McDonalds working) - a 12 year old learning 3d sculpting and a 7 year old... doing whatever 7 years olds do 😄
 Jakobe#0322: Q.q.: is it possible to view the games thatve been submitted yet,? Or is that only after the jam itself ends?
 absolutelyivy#3850: yeah good luck!! make sure the kids get sleep and eat lol
 Msipp#6059: urrrgh i still hate this theme
 steeleater#7580: never heard of someone's kids helping them out with a jam. id love to play whatever you guys cook up
 LordCthuluke#1523:  cheers! Will need it. Likewise well wishing to yourself 😄
 Frozen#7676: I wish you and your kids the best of luck
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: take this to tech help and also if theres an error say what the error is
 LordCthuluke#1523:  awesome to hear. I am doing my first GameJam ever - hopefully get something done! (my kids are joining in.. so who knows!)
 Frozen#7676: Decided to change my mind on quitting the jam. Time to speed develop
 Merus#7019: "pipped at the post"
 GAMERNINJASK#1503: why when i want to play my game from the itch io app it says an error about the build (i made the game on unity)?
 absolutelyivy#3850: awwwwwww that one's cute
 Rohandabest#2573: lmao I found this one on redit : Why do dice prefer to be in groups of two?
Because then it's a pair-a-dice
 borboss#7877: i literally have no dice in my game lmfao
i couldn’t think of a good way to include them
 absolutelyivy#3850: ^^ very very good
 Rohandabest#2573: How would you ask out a D&D player?... ask them for a D8
 272354#2943: so does mine - i don't mean that people aren't using randomness. i just find it interesting how many games feature dice as a thematic element.
it's going to be a cohesive jam!
 Srekel#3659: Thanks, will look into this 🙂
 Caenir33#8285: after 2 hours I have a unity game where you click a button to roll a dice to deal damage to an enemy which does nothing. most of that time was getting visual studio code to work with unity. think i'm done
 .Jony#4882: oh well got no team not participating i guess
 GAMERNINJASK#1503: Help, when i want to submit the game, it tells me that i am reguired to click the No, i used pre-existing art
 Lukey#6052: I woke up this morning (that's when the jam started in my timezone) and I was tired so my brain just went *hmm im making a board game* and I literally just started making a board game. Obviously, it's quite boring. I wanna restart. But it's been over 12 hours and I've made so much art. (Actually to be honest, I could re-use some of it if I restarted). I think I might restart.
 borboss#7877: mine has an element of randomness
 Nobody6502#8971: ugh I don't wanna make a scrolling camera system but I should
 Ahnaf30e#3408: i wasted one hour of my life trying to draw a dice smh
 Jemmeh#7117: We have our main level design done and some of the mechanics whew. Big day
 absolutelyivy#3850: i dropped my creative writing minor so i gotta use that knowledge on _something_
 Rav#3300: I wish my English was this good to make puns with words, but unfortunately
 Rav#3300: God damn I like this
 absolutelyivy#3850: ty ty :3
 anth#0817: thats actually so fire for whoever wants it lol
 272354#2943: i find it interesting how most people are making a game *about dice* rather than a game *about randomness*
as someone who is doing both, i'm curious to see whether we see a thematic staleness to this year's jam. a lot of games are going to look and feel similar. never before has the gmtk jam had such a narrow focus on one thematic idea.
 absolutelyivy#3850: i wanted to do something with "Cease and D6" but i couldn't figure it out
 Lukey#6052: literally 12 hours in and I wanna scrap my whole entire project
 nekotheasparagus#0809: “A dicey situation”
 anth#0817: paying cold hard cash for dice puns
 Lukey#6052: i just took a massiveee break but im really low on motivation still cuz i dont like my idea
 absolutelyivy#3850: ^^smaaaart
 wren#0640: oh shit that reminds me i should really back up my project folder
 Lawn#1538: But yeah, downloadable and playable on Windows, or web embed on itch.io at a minimum.
 sendhelpidfk#6700: i am now finally back to where i was several hours ago aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
 Lawn#1538: > You can not require the user to download additional software from external sources (so no ROMs for emulators, or games for Roblox. If your game requires additional files (like DLLs) they should be included in the download and not require separate installation).
Mark plays the games via the itch.io application, if it doesn't play from within that, then it won't count. Embedded web games on itch.io should work fine.
 wren#0640: has to either be downloadable or playable in itch
 Rav#3300: I'm writing to him that's better to do a more generic theme with a good looking, never fail palette like zughy32 if he wants pastel colours because we got a lot to do...what do you think? I just need an outside feedback
 Srekel#3659: Hi, got a rules question 🙂 Is it a requirement that the game is downloadable? I'd like to make mine with dot big bang, which is an online web platform for making games, so it would just be a link.
 Kol^2#3744: ✊
 hatoving#4710: 🤝
 Kol^2#3744: hi Five bro
 hatoving#4710: I slept for 0 hours
 Clive Dev#0446: i slept for 3 hours
 Kol^2#3744: Sleep is certainly good, but I will only sleep on my girlfriend's chest
 Tapu#9161: It isn't, you'll feel grumpy which will lead to not stonks 📉
 Kol^2#3744: I'm going to do it myself on "Construct2"
 5fm#0001: ah shit
 FryDev#0372: 5 hours and 1 minute of sleep, and then you’re talking
 PlatosMan#2789: Go for 6 to be safe
 Kol^2#3744: my team dumped me
 5fm#0001: 5 hours of sleep should be enough, right?
 CSharp#4989: And now...he will try
 Giga chad#0085: "***600 missed messages***"
 sleepdrifter95$#0912: I just know that the roundup after this is going to be mostly about games that didn’t take the theme literally 🤣
 ballfun#5808: my team just woke up *how2getideaz(speedrun)*
 CSharp#4989: Games done! Whew! Wonder why people think game dev is hard? /j
 Giga chad#0085: like never ever, I slept for like 4 like 5 hours and this chat is still typing
 Pygocentrus#8974: It is a big event
 CSharp#4989: Gotta click the import game button on unity I forgot
 Giga chad#0085: bro this chat is never dead
 toiletsnakes#0869: It’ll just take like 2 seconds
 hatoving#4710: well, if I don't, I might as well just use music from the website's recommended resources
 CSharp#4989: I got movement down and the initial steps of a main mechanic down...now just for literally everything else
 FryDev#0372: I finally got an idea after 10 hours for a western dice wrangling game, so, pretty good
 Rav#3300: Well, they said "when I find a composer"
 Rav#3300: Yes
More personalized stuff is good
 hatoving#4710: it adds personality
 Pygocentrus#8974: It is hard to make music
 Unclouded#9240: it is
but most people arent musicians
 Bart Moon#2749: No
 Rav#3300: Custom music = better
 SkinnerSpace#8418: It was a nightmare. I woke up in the middle of the night because I dreamed of the process of coming up with ideas but I was stuck and now when I came back at my computer I'm still just gazing at a blank screen.
 Unclouded#9240: cant you use music if you get permission or credit it
 hatoving#4710: gettin good lol
Might even complete the whole game when I find a composer 🥴
 Rav#3300: Bad for now lol, I guess the main person kinds forget there was the gamejam so we have an even shorter time to make stuff now
 Selviam#7268: oh yeah i love the theme too theres just something about dice that are so cool to me
 tykenn#8548: I think I finally have all the main systems in place, so it should mostly be adding actual content from this point on
 Yoshi#0080: loving the theme! when are we getting gmtk-branded commemorative fuzzy dice
 Rav#3300: People actually make noise generators and 3d games with scratch, I have no idea how, those things are impressive lol
 Panda S#8673: can someone help my visual studio isnt showing error lines
 icekiller158#1816: i'm not taking part, but rather watching from the sideline
 Unclouded#9240: i had top start over because fusion(what i use) wont work
i am working in scratch
 Rav#3300: 3d scratch game
 Selviam#7268: ehhhhhh i just got my idea down nw im gonna make some assets and try to learn tile based movement
 Pygocentrus#8974: Thanks for holding this event
 icekiller158#1816: oh hello mark
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Getting sleepy! Might take a break soon! But, our game has dice in it!
How are you, Mark?
 Mark Brown#6982: How's everyone getting on?
 NoelJasik#8768: When did i dunk on PHP though, that language is bussin fr
 NoelJasik#8768: Than make a game about crack, so that there's addiction diversity
 Merus#7019: sorry, the mods have just cracked this cunning code so it's time to wrap up dunking on PHP in the general channel
 Panda S#8673: my visual studio isnt showing errors pls help
 ryan123#4605: lot of people gonna have a gambling addiction after this jam
 NoelJasik#8768: Pot heads pancakes are bussin
 spagoogi#5559: Portly Hamsters Partying is so overrated...
 Yoshi#0080: i actually was using the 7 - side trick, but it didn’t really occur to me that i could use it for 3 sides to simplify things. this may be what i need to resolve my rotation issue in the morning—thanks so much!
 Soup#3034: if you want to update it after it closes make a new itch page for the non jam version
 GAMERNINJASK#1503: ok
 NoelJasik#8768: Until the jam closes mr gamer nijask
 Merus#7019: yep! up until the jam closes
 GAMERNINJASK#1503: if we submit the game, can we still update it?
 pixal#1121: And that too recursive
 Soup#3034: penguin's healthy posture is the worst language
 BuyMyBeard#8716: So basically the 2 rules of a dice is that each surface has the number 1 to 6 on it, and the opposing faces have a sum of 7. so you only need to know 3 of the sides (say Top, North, and West), and the rest can be easily calculated by doing 7 - the opposing side. if you want to be able to roll the dice, it can either roll north, south, east or west, and you can simply make a new dice with translated sides
 Selviam#7268: i dont have anything done and im gonna be busy all weekend but i dont wnna drop out ughggh
 spagoogi#5559: I vote for the porcupine one. nice and cute. not cyber at all.
 NoelJasik#8768: $response = "Skill issue";
Echo $response;
 spagoogi#5559: okay but seriously Hypertext Preprocessor is way too cool of a word for what it actually is
 nekotheasparagus#0809: What do you have against Porcupine Holding Potholders?
 Yoshi#0080: to be clear, i’m turning the die to the correct side, i just don’t have the face rotated the correct way from top-down, if you feel me
 Soup#3034: POLICE! HELP! PLEASE! is very annoying to use
 NoelJasik#8768: Hello i am matlab and this is game theory, today we gonna cook meth
 Yoshi#0080: that would honestly be a godsend if you’re willing! i was planning to bash my head against it in the morning, haha
 Soup#3034: i dont need to 😎
 BuyMyBeard#8716: want the solution? it took me 3 hours to figure out, its actually pretty simple
 NoelJasik#8768: Well what your problem with personel, homes and pages?
 dark prince of kisses#3874: Imagine not making your game in MatLab
 BuyMyBeard#8716: lol what, hell nah i'm not programming using *Personnal Home Page*
 Yoshi#0080: did the same. didn’t get the sides rotating correctly though for my want to move on to the next task
 NoelJasik#8768: Javascript? Try php next time, way better stuff
 BuyMyBeard#8716: what's really funny is that I see all these people who simply use a borrowed dice 3d asset, meanwhile I had to figure out how to make a 2d dice have logical sides only using javascript
 dark prince of kisses#3874: Just made a cup of coffee, it's 12:31, f it, we ball
 dark prince of kisses#3874: If I finish it 😩 . I have some friends pitching in some art assets but am otherwise solo this time around.
 nekotheasparagus#0809: It doesn’t have a built in pixel filter, but you can change the render resolution to get a pixel effect
 Soup#3034: seems very difficult, but it sounds like your game is gonna be fun
 icekiller158#1816: you can update it as much as you want before the submission closes
 Rav#3300: I don't code, but doesn't unity have like a pixel filter kind of thing? You could do that in 3d, when render it with that thing to make it look 2d
 BuyMyBeard#8716: Yeah, thats for sure. I'm not familiar yet with the engine, so I just make HTML games with javascript, and sometimes use different APIs
 wren#0640: I think one more level and a menu and I'll submit my first build?
 PinkyThreat#9450: bruh im bruh im screwed
 Chal#6423: **perfect**
 dark prince of kisses#3874: Anyways if anybody has any tutorials on making Rubik's cube-like rotations in 2d isometric in Unity, I'm all ears...
 Soup#3034: i think its the most popular game engine
 Hobusu#5033: You can update your game as many times as you like before the submission deadline, however after the deadline games cannot be updated until after voting has ended
 Rav#3300: I mean, unity is the most popular game engine by far
 BuyMyBeard#8716: seems like a lot of people are making their game in Unity
 Chal#6423: I wonder if i can update my game during the jam
 Chal#6423: Yea your right
 icekiller158#1816: i wouldn't worry too much about it though, it is still fun to see what people come up with even if the ideas overlap in some ways
 Rav#3300: He's a good leader, in the previous gamejam (brackeys) we came #22 out of around 1700 games I think? Like, we can do good stuff if we want, this is our first short gamejam, it was just badly timed, I dunno if we're gonna finish in time...but we'll try
 Soup#3034: so true
 NikReta (NCAM)#4357: we havent even started yet 👍
 Rav#3300: I wrote a better description. Let me plop this into dalle and let's see
 idk anymore#0323: midjourney singlehandedly carrying my asset creation :v
 Chal#6423: Ah crap
 dark prince of kisses#3874: Sounds like you have a jumping off point! Do your best with that and if it isn't what he likes, that's his failure as a leader, not yours as an artist :)
 icekiller158#1816: yea, there is gonna be some overlapping ideas in the jam
 Chal#6423: Same
 RedcoatsRevolt (Adam)#1185: Finished for the night. Getting a good night sleep. Good luck to those up for a few more hours!
 Chal#6423: Oh yea about that, i think i might have the same idea as that
 Rav#3300: That's the best I can describe it
 icekiller158#1816: another idea for anyone to use or make a derivative of
it is like rock scissor paper, but rogue-like and the dice can have anything on the face like elements or the traditional numbers
you and an opponent have X number of dice acting as HP, you both roll to get the winning element or higher number, etc. you lose a die permanently for the duration of the run each time you lose a roll. winning a battle will earn you two or X dice for the duration of the run
 Rav#3300: I think he wants me to do happy Bloodborne pixel art things
 Rav#3300: Yea this is not what he wants for sure
 dark prince of kisses#3874: Dude Midjourney has been an absolute godsend for concepting
 Rav#3300: That's actually not a bad idea, but I'm afraid it will just spit out generic fantasy
 dark prince of kisses#3874: I tease. Sounds like he's thinking of that pseudo-victorian architecture with a Ghibli pallette, so big on the hue and saturation
 Rav#3300: I dunno. He's sleeping now, he works tomorrow morning, I guess I'll find it out tomorrow (today? It's 6am) afternoon
 Rav#3300: He probably doesn't, I know him very well, and like, he's a better artists than me (I'm not good to begin with), but he can't explain himself too well
 Capybara#8868: what actually is this that hes asking about? you could make it span multiple tiles maybe but still yikes
 Rav#3300: Do whatever you feel like lmao, I'm going to bed for now
 dark prince of kisses#3874: I think he means "generic fantasy" but doesn't know it
 Rav#3300: Nono, Magical Victorian, whatever that means, the pastel parts refers to the steampunk-medieval-whatever thing
 NoelJasik#8768: I am tired and i dunno if i am supposed to laugh or feel bad for you?
 dark prince of kisses#3874: Put it into Dall-e or Midjourney ;)
 Unclouded#9240: trace the movie art?
 nekotheasparagus#0809: Magic pastels
 dark prince of kisses#3874: Tis the hour when you decide if you go all in
 Rav#3300: My group leader "yes for the art something like Howl Moving Castle, magical-victorian style, also medieval but steampunk, coloured with pastel-like colours, a lot of gold but not much metal"
All of this in tiles that are 14x14
Like man wtf do you want me to do????
 NoelJasik#8768: It's 6 am and i don't even feel tired
 Scolon#4218: It's almost time to sleep
 Glitch#1483: Thankyou!
 icekiller158#1816: people can use my idea if they like or make a derivative of it
 Unclouded#9240: dice gun
 박재민#0597: woah, a gun shaped dice huh. cool!
 Unclouded#9240: my idea is where you gun deals random damage
the bullets that comes out tells you how much damage it will do
 toilet gin (Rip Techno)#8501: I did the survey, hope you ace the school assignment (:
 박재민#0597: you're actually making the best game huh
 nekotheasparagus#0809: That is glorious
 icekiller158#1816: i won't be making a game
but what about a ninja that throws dice at cheaters in a casino to get them kicked out?
 박재민#0597: lol
 nekotheasparagus#0809: A game where you make dinner rolls but dice keep trying to distract you
 박재민#0597: in a same vive we actually can make real roll out of a dice like roll of a toilet paper, and have a reddit devate on the direction we're hanging it.
just a random idea i threw away. anybody got some?
 darlingS#1797: It's midday for me but I've been up since midnight
 Glitch#1483: I would really appreciate it if some of you could complete this survey for me. It is for a school assignment and is completely anonymous. I understand everyone’s mid-way through a game jam (because I am too), if you still want to help me out though you can save the link and complete it later (within the next week please). Thankyou to those who already have.
 Unclouded#9240: its midnight for me
 Capybara#8868: hoo boy woke up at 5am and its 4pm for me rn
 pandabond#4740: Hey im doing something similar. But i feel its really constricting. Since the world only has 6 faces to work with
 MangoWorks#1202: well my first day is done
 dark prince of kisses#3874: All my more experienced dev friends are busy this weekend so I'm really scrambling to build everything I need to. Which is a shame bc I think my design is a real home run this time
 FryDev#0372: hooray, everyone makes a game
 Capybara#8868: thats fair
 sendhelpidfk#6700: it should mostly be copy and pasting in the unaffected files but god i hate how gms2 breaks source control approximately right now
 박재민#0597: YO congrats!!
 Ðazed♡#8249: AHA finally figured out how i can add the dice to my game!! its so damn perfect of a way to add it too :3
 sendhelpidfk#6700: time to rebuild my game after it corrupted
 박재민#0597: I mean, ｐｈｙｓｉｃｓ　ｐｌｅａｓｕｒｅ matters for me lol
 Chowdog 宗翰#0135: And don't change any order in the file tree
 SamVinyl#0485: We figured that out, but it also happens for other files if we aren't working on the same room.
 박재민#0597: i'm just concentrating to make an platformer dice hero where physically P L E A S A N T
 Chowdog 宗翰#0135: If you have changes on the same room and you merge there will be conflicts
 박재민#0597: yeah that works huh
 nekotheasparagus#0809: Personally I started by creating a little die dude so I automatically fit the theme (half joke - die dude does exist but he’s not my only theme link)
 dark prince of kisses#3874: I took it literally and am physically rotating a cube, pulling in the luck elements in the narrative design
 Chowdog 宗翰#0135: Don't work on the same room
 PlatosMan#2789: Beware softlocking. That's what ended up striking down every idea for a platformer with rng mechanics
 박재민#0597: exactly. you got the point, stalk
 nekotheasparagus#0809: Roll of the dice can also refer to luck, and in a way the unfairness of randomness. Pretty fun to work with :D
 SamVinyl#0485: Anybody a github genius that can help me and my brother with connecting it to GameMaker Visual? Every time we pull it has conflicts that we can't figure out how to merge.
 PlatosMan#2789: Yeah. That's what's been paralyzing me. Every idea I came up with felt like everyone else was probably doing the same thing
 박재민#0597: tbh when I first saw the theme I thought the word 'dice' is already a restriction (since it's an... dice.)
but I mean, after a hours of brainstorming, there was like.. uh, creativity out of restriction moment.
so right now I love this theme for sure.
 toilet gin (Rip Techno)#8501: i just had a cool idea for the game jam. it could be like there is a grid split up into 6 parts and every 5 or so seconds  a dice rolls. let's say i roll a 5, the platform in the grid of sixes would go to the fifth box.  might be kinda luck-based though
 wren#0640: wtf my last jam was a week long and i only got 7 levels done and i now have 7 levels after what like 9 hours?
 FryDev#0372: I got a good idea, somehow
 Capybara#8868: i have like 30 tabs open rn
 dark prince of kisses#3874: I think it's easy to get trapped in obvious ideas for this theme, which is demoralizing and unexciting, but there's a lot to do with it if you sit on it for a bit
 Capybara#8868: bruh
 BadPiggy#5202: Oink
 PlatosMan#2789: Lol, I also needed a nap to come up with my current idea
 박재민#0597: relatable
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Mornin pig
🐽
 Capybara#8868: hoho
 Snory#4231: When I saw the theme yesterday I was like "damn, this does not spark even a little bit of fantasy and joy in me". But this morning, after I woke up, I think I came up with something what could be a bit fun.
 PlatosMan#2789: Yeah, except it took me 6 hours to even come up with the current idea cuz nothing else I tried to come up with worked :(
 BadPiggy#5202: I awake now kek
Time to try a very stupid idea
 nekotheasparagus#0809: Probably means you might wanna look into a different game idea? No fun making a game if you don’t feel it
 박재민#0597: maybe we're all on covid blues. cheer up bruh
 PlatosMan#2789: I was honestly so proud and excited while working on my submission last year, even though it too didn't go anywhere near the top 100. This year I feel nothing.
 nekotheasparagus#0809: Honestly I like the theme. Wasn’t expecting it so get to work a little outside my comfort zone
 박재민#0597: I like the theme this year tho. it's kinda more instict than last year's "join together."
 Chowdog 宗翰#0135: I don't like this theme too🥲
 Unclouded#9240: you have done more then most if you even post
 PlatosMan#2789: I really dislike this theme. Y'all are right tho. It is playable and kinda fun.
 박재민#0597: at least if you made something you're able to play it's better than anything
 PlatosMan#2789: Yeah, but I doubt it's going anywhere near the top 100 :(
 Capybara#8868: jesus christ its been 11 hours
 nekotheasparagus#0809: Mini game feels work for jams! You want people to be able to get an idea of if they like your game in a few minutes, so if your whole game can be completely in that time nothing wrong with that!
 박재민#0597: that's ok. i'm trying to make kinda physically acurate dice feel and i found out i'm stuck on it
 wyrm_slayr#7477: Believe it or not, that's actually a good thing from my experience.
 Chowdog 宗翰#0135: Hey minigame is still a game
 PlatosMan#2789: It's been 11 hours and I'm starting to realize my game feels like more of a minigame than an actual game
 박재민#0597: yeahhhh
 Unclouded#9240: wut up
 FryDev#0372: I’m glad I have an idea
 박재민#0597: yo ahoy game jam guys
 Ragh#5984: I'm regretting so much going for a card game
 Jemmeh#7117: ahaha boy I sure do hope so, it's got memes and thats what matters
 Tapu#9161:  try seeing if this works
 Lawn#1538: > You can not require the user to download additional software from external sources (so no ROMs for emulators, or games for Roblox. If your game requires additional files (like DLLs) they should be included in the download and not require separate installation).
If you can embed in Scratch, then that would get you sorted 
 wyrm_slayr#7477: That means it is an amazing idea :)
 ryan123#4605: you can post to itch.io with that
 Jemmeh#7117: our idea is so goofy I keep having to stop and convince myself to keep going 😅
 Lawn#1538: Have a read of the rules to find out what you can and can't do:
 Reptilian135#9436: where can i get some free 2d dice assets
 Unclouded#9240: would it be possible to just upload a link to the website
 theChief#0001: Then I think it's probably against the rules, sorry! It has to be playable through itch.io
 wyrm_slayr#7477: Lol
 Unclouded#9240: what does embed mean?
 Lawn#1538: RIP me.
 ryan123#4605: you can embed it
 Lawn#1538: Sorry, had a doozy of a morning.
 Lawn#1538: oh yeah, whoops
 theChief#0001: Definitely a wrong reply
 wyrm_slayr#7477: I didn't say anything about Scratch
 Unclouded#9240: to play a scratch game it has to be on the scratch website
 theChief#0001: I think it was a wrong reply 😂
 Lawn#1538: I didn't say it was?
 wyrm_slayr#7477: Why would that be against the rules Lol
 Unclouded#9240: Fusion(what im using) isnt working because i have the free version
 Lawn#1538: I believe so. Have a read of the rules to find out what you can and can't do
 Tapu#9161: Absolutely
 pandabond#4740: Yup also making them holes defeats the whole core mechanic. It'd end up being a fancy menu screen
 wyrm_slayr#7477: You could make it a highscore game with respawning enemies or coins or something.
 Unclouded#9240: would scratch be ok
 theChief#0001: I'd even say it _shouldn't_ be a long game 😂 a good length to aim for is about 5 minutes. Players will start to drop out at around the 2-3 minute mark unless they're really enjoying themselves!
 FryDev#0372: okay. so my idea is a western themed endless game where you pair up dice to make snake eyes and make them disappear
 Tapu#9161: Tho 21 levels are a bit too much for such a short jam
 Tapu#9161: What if those 21 holes 🕳️ led to other levels?
 nekotheasparagus#0809: 21 platforms can be interesting and fun, just need to design it. Doesn’t have to be a long game, heck, each level could be a different die?
 Capybara#8868: maybe you could work with d8's?
 pandabond#4740: But i can't possibly think of making it fun with only 21 platforms. Need something more....
 nekotheasparagus#0809: You’re allowed to use any engine as long as it’s playable on a windows computer with no additional programs (in short - yes, just make sure you export for windows or HTML)
 Chowdog 宗翰#0135: Every game engine works
 Tapu#9161: If you're experienced with it then it absolutely will
 Lawn#1538: Definitely.
 wyrm_slayr#7477: Sounds cool so far.
 Chowdog 宗翰#0135: Hi
 Unclouded#9240: would gamemaker studio work for the jam
 Pyramid Sam#8630: Hey everyone. Not a designer here. But just an enjoyer of games and excited to see what everyone comes up with!
 Tapu#9161: Hi
 Break#1234: yeah i keep seeing people i remember from last year too
 pandabond#4740: Basically the whole world is a dice. With each side having platform as same as the face of die. So one side has only one platform,another with six. You spawn of a side. And you can basically jump over the edges  to change the face. So like you can jump over four to go to two or six.... Etc.
 nekotheasparagus#0809: I think I finally found a good balance between my ideas, being possible, and actually being fun
Also hi Tapu! I remember seeing you last year, cool to see a familiar face
 Tapu#9161: Oh
 wyrm_slayr#7477: Probably just early gameplay prototypes.
At least that's what it is for me.
 Soup#3034: i like that part too
 Tapu#9161: How tf people already submitted 
 Chazi b#4006: I think my favorite part of game deving is when you mess up coding something but it's still cool so you keep it, my projectile shooting is not how I wanted it but I like it anyway
 wyrm_slayr#7477: Sure, what's the idea?
 Break#1234: oh god my idea is so complicated so it could easily be so terrible but imma do it anyway
i wanna do something original this time
 Unclouded#9240: would the free version of gamemaker studio be good for the jam
 pandabond#4740: Hey its first jam. That too solo. I came up with an idea about the game but dont know how to make puzzles out of it. Can someone validate of its a half decent idea
 FryDev#0372: top down game where you must hit dice to change their side. change two dice to get snake eyes and make them disappear
 Tapu#9161: Took me hour and a half to fall asleep, there were just too many ideas bubbling up
 Zixon7#3892: Rip
 Soup#3034: haha i spent hours setting up a skeleton based character only to decide i didnt want to use a skeleton based character because it was ugly
 Michel#2879: I haven't slept yet. I was already fixing my sleep schedule and this jam helps lmao
 Tapu#9161: Lol you too
 Dr Civilization#8741: Hey, just took a look at the GMTK branding and noticed there isn't any animation like there was in previous years from what I can tell, is that available this year?
 Cameron#7818: Lets hope you'll have an easier time falling asleep than I did yesterday, lol
 FryDev#0372: alright, I have an idea
 Michel#2879: everyone suddenly became my best friend
 LOPSTERu#3902: I have just realized that i have overscoped
 Zixon7#3892: I’m about to go to sleep 💀
 Michel#2879: same
 Selviam#7268: every social gathering just piled up the weekend of the jam hwahahahah
 Michel#2879: How good is an average Asus laptop. How much rest should I expect it to need after getting hot
 Cameron#7818: Just woke up, time for day 2 of the jam.
 Tapu#9161: Here's the one I'm gonna do, use the dice marking as attack and health and just straight up ripoff heartstone
 Hobusu#5033: So there's a lot of leeway for you to interpret the theme however you want
 Hobusu#5033: Some people are doing things based on the word 'dice' alone and interpreting it as like dicing food for example, and Mark said that was okay!
 Lukey#6052: i spent like almost an hour on a random side feature that turns out I'm probably not gonna use :D
 icekiller158#1816: comic sans is great! i used to use it on one of the instant messenger app back in the day
 Lawn#1538: Coming up with ideas!
 Selviam#7268: hours into the jam and ive done *nothing*
 Yoshi#0080: definitely not! you're free to interpret the theme however you like
 Tapu#9161: Just woke up what are you guys upto?
 Smoke#2408: hey asking again but does anyone know if you need to include actual dice in your game
 Beeg scarf#3571: Hey dont do your friends like that
 Penguinmanereikel#3708: I mean, it’s just an easy idea. But the problem I’ve come across is that I have no idea how to design levels for it. Bloxors from Miniclip should be good for inspiration, though. I’d recommend replaying it if you’re having trouble
 Aiminer357#8033: lol my "team" is just my friends that i occassionally ask favors for like some sprites
 MangoWorks#1202: i used it for mt 3rd grade essay and i got an A+
 M_Raven#4076: Pros of being in a team: competent programmers
Cons of being in a team: oh god I have to either reverse-engineer this or ask the programmer to walk me through it
 Cearáj#9556: precisely why it's gold
 Beeg scarf#3571: it looks DUMB and CHILDISH and professional irl places use it, namely restaurants
 wren#0640: almost exactly what I'm doing lol
 Cearáj#9556: sans real
 Penguinmanereikel#3708: If anyone’s interested, my idea was to have a top-down grid based puzzle game where you control a die, and things like switches and the exit can only be activated if you land the die on a specific side. Don’t know how many other people are doing the same thing though.
 Freast#9278: If I had a nickel for every time my dad booted me off the pc late at night while working on a gmtk game jam submission forcing me to crunch everything into <24 hours I'd have 2 nickels, which isn't alot but it's weird it happened twice
 MangoWorks#1202: comic sans is hated for no reason i like the font
 Beeg scarf#3571: always glad to help a fellow dev
 icekiller158#1816: comic sans is always the better one
 Cyber#0968: true, I'm just going to leave it and move on lol
 nekotheasparagus#0809: You have given me an evil idea
 wren#0640: it's always good to avoid sunk cost though, just because it takes a while doesn't mean it's *good*
 Beeg scarf#3571: comic sans
 Ðazed♡#8249: ah damnit i lost that one rly good font and now i gotta find a better one
 nekotheasparagus#0809: Design in a nutshell
 Cyber#0968: That moment when you spend over an hour getting the crosshair grow/shrink just right only to immediately replace it with a dot
 Beeg scarf#3571: the hub world and dog boss songs are pretty good
 icekiller158#1816: what you mean? that is music, not the traditional music that everyone listens to but it is music
 MangoWorks#1202: ok fine im listening to undertale dummy
 SomeTingOdd#8346: steve lacy rn lol
 FryDev#0372: the Cuphead DLC music is really good
 Cearáj#9556: *I just remembered that stanley parable lore generator*
 Ðazed♡#8249: i might see if i can either find someone to help with cleaning out my idea and make it maybe better + music soon tbh
 Beeg scarf#3571: stuck in the middle with you
 Penguinmanereikel#3708: Music? Ha! I just listen to the lonely, isolating sound of my computer fan, plus the tower fan keeping it cool.
 SomeTingOdd#8346: this idea is super cool!!!
 Crusher48#2092: Has anyone thought of doing something grim-reaper related after seeing "die" one too many times?
 nekotheasparagus#0809: I mean you could probably use a random word generator and see if anything sparks an idea
 MangoWorks#1202: im listening to my fan its awesome but a bit repetitive
 FryDev#0372: Cuphead
 Aiminer357#8033: aight time to get serious. what kinda music yall listening to for the jam
 Cearáj#9556: AI that generates ideas when
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: possibly yeah
 Break#1234: that means ive gotta think of 6 ideas tho lol
 wren#0640: I need to sleep bc I keep designing puzzles thinking I'm a genius and I just KNOW I'm gonna wake up and be like what the fuck is this
 MATRIX#4627: hey walrusware i think we have met before in godot game engine
 FryDev#0372: okay, I’m going to make a game where you need to make a pair of dice get snake eyes
 icekiller158#1816: randomly write 6 ideas, then roll a dice to pick one of them 👍
 Smoke#2408: does the game need to include physical dice or is including a probability element enough to fit the theme
 Cearáj#9556: same boat
 Pygocentrus#8974: I am just here to get ideas
 Break#1234: lmao ive still got no idea what to make
 icekiller158#1816: i have plans to learn unity, just need to find motivation to dive into it
i already watched and followed a 4.5 hour basic C# tutorial in one sitting some time ago
 FryDev#0372: what about a game where you have two dice enemies, and you have to make them roll snake eyes
 Penguinmanereikel#3708: Like, I legit have no idea how to design puzzles for my game lol
 Penguinmanereikel#3708: Hey, I know that we’re like 12 hours into this already, and im not even putting a lot of effort into this, but I found the motivation to do “something” just to revitalize my interest in game design again. But if anyone’s willing to lend a hand, I need some help making levels for my puzzle game
 PokeNinjaGuy#9592: my friends are using it because they don't know unity lmao
 No_Namer007#8260: ok thnx guys
 Sandra#4621: if you can output it as a standalone file, yeah.
 PokeNinjaGuy#9592: yeah you can
 ImNotAsher#6733: no you can
 icekiller158#1816: the furry bear dice is a secret character that is kinda fun to play too
 No_Namer007#8260: am i allowed to use scratch? (i know its a kids site)
 PokeNinjaGuy#9592: I especially love the robot character -- I love how different each character plays!
 icekiller158#1816: it is a rouge-like, you use the dice in your hands to use your skills
you also have different classes with a special skill, like warrior have the skill to reroll the dice
 PokeNinjaGuy#9592: I too enjoy dicey dungeon
 Pygocentrus#8974: Its a fun game
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I enjoy dicey dungeon a lot
 Beeg scarf#3571: what's the dicey dungeon gameplay loop anyway
 Chowdog 宗翰#0135: Gn
 StuartXYZ#1675: im going to sleep, goodnight everyone, i hope you enjoyed the first day of the jam
 icekiller158#1816: dice is a pretty interesting theme i would say
tbh, i was just playing dicey dungeon right before the theme announcement and thought to myself "what if the theme involves something with a dice", and that happened to be true 😅
 JoelOfWalse#8278: I was tempted to make something based on FFXI's Corsair job
 SomeTingOdd#8346: ngl not the biggest fan of my concept but the art is turning out really cute and thats fun to work on :>
 CrashCubeZeroOne#0715: gn everyone, 6am probs time to sleep
 JelyMe#2483: Have a gn. Timezones means it is midday for me
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: oh I see you're not matching the cards, you are matching them to die face
 FryDev#0372: well, the catch is that you don’t know what the die is going to roll until the cards are all shuffled. so you have to keep track of all the cards to make sure you can pick the right one, but I don’t know
 Rohandabest#2573: Im doing this in Korea lmao its 12 in the afternoon for me 🙂
 PokeNinjaGuy#9592: but also pretty vague
 Scolon#4218: I just finished  today's dev session but I'm doing a bit of planning for tomorrow
 Michel#2879: seems like nobody went to sleep
 Scolon#4218: I... just accidentally made an asset that isn't going to be in the game lmao
Good thing it only took 2 minutes to make
 Occelot Dan#3777: Well folks, I'm logging off for the evening! Wishing you all the best of luck in the jam, it's been such a pleasure chatting with you all! No matter what, remember that just giving the jam an honest go is a huge win, and you should all be proud of the awesome work you are doing! 🧡
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I would just take out the idea that they are faces of a die and just make the card memory game. Good idea though
 Rohandabest#2573: Im dont really like this theme. a little to specific for my liking
 FryDev#0372: what if you had a memory game where you have to keep track of six cards which represent faces of a die. at the end, you have to pick the card with the symbol of the die
 PokeNinjaGuy#9592: it is though
 hatoving#4710: honestly, i was kinda worried that it would be boring but it's a really good theme this time around
 JelyMe#2483: I spent thirty minutes on something that isn't even gonna be in the game
 Scolon#4218: That said try not to polish too much too early
 pexx#1899: its not tho... 😭
 JelyMe#2483: I found an epic CC Attribution model of a d20 with epic grunge and plastic textures
 Scolon#4218: High quality spikes though
 Minimg#8623: Worth, high quality spikes
 pexx#1899: man i really spent a hour drawing some spikes 🤦‍♂️
 Scolon#4218: awesome
 epicman#3996: thanks
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: you can use premade code or assets as long as you have the legal right to use them
 Beeg scarf#3571: yeah
 epicman#3996: am i allowed to use brackeys' character controller unedited if it's free use
 dangertimmy#8239: haha thanks! yes indeed this is surely the first of many
 Unclouded#9240: based
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: well done
 wyrm_slayr#7477: Congrats! ~~there will be many more to come~~
 icekiller158#1816: pog
 dangertimmy#8239: just fixed a bug by myself for like the first time ever!
 Khush#5581: thanks for giving me motivation
 Khush#5581: I will try to make a game
 Thisisareallylongname#6139: guys i need help with a problem
 icekiller158#1816: only just 10 hours have passed, that is not a day, you still have 40 hours to finish the game and submit it
 Cearáj#9556: it's just been 10 hours
 Khush#5581: IST
 ConstantDerivative#6302: wait what is your TZ
 MangoWorks#1202: my game is basically just luck be landlord as a town builder
 PepperBoi#4544: I’m doing a boring way of just having some rng lol
 Khush#5581: almost
 FryDev#0372: Karm White
 wren#0640: evil mark brown be like: game destroyers toolkit
 Aiminer357#8033: the theme is def more restrictive than previous years
 ConstantDerivative#6302: a day hasnt finished yet
 Cearáj#9556: oh yes they *die*
 darlingS#1797: My team is going dice as in "slice and dice"
 Khush#5581: This is so unfair
Its just been morning in my TZ and almost a day has finished
 icekiller158#1816: i'm mark brown's evil twin here to sabotage the game jam! 😈
||jk, i'm just here to have fun and watch the people do the jam||
 FryDev#0372: I think it’s a little restrictive
 PepperBoi#4544: The theme is hard but not boring
 ConstantDerivative#6302: How about a game where the enemies are dice and shooting the dice will make them roll, and if the number they roll is a 1 they die, i dont know if that is a good idea or not
 Aiminer357#8033: joining game jams? in this economy?
 icekiller158#1816: hello
 Thisisareallylongname#6139: people/game jam participants
 Beeg scarf#3571: who are you people
 Chowdog 宗翰#0135: Nah we're just random people chatting
 FryDev#0372: it definitely is imo
 MATRIX#4627: i think the theme is a bit hard
 Aiminer357#8033: nah i dont think anyone is joining it
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: on the itch page all details are in your local timezone
 MATRIX#4627: hey,anyone participation in the game jam
 Unclouded#9240: hey mods when does the jam end in EST
 Ahat#0842: thanks
 Occelot Dan#3777: Hey I'm still hype for this concept! I say go for it!
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: there's no downside to joining the jam though so you could join just in case
 toilet gin (Rip Techno)#8501: oh okay thanks
 SpawnCampGames#8155: day 1 down and i have almost nothing.. But thats just how it rolls... *pun intended* hope everyone is doing well! see ya tomorrow 😉
 Pygocentrus#8974: I don't know how to code
 Ahat#0842: ok thats good to know
 ConstantDerivative#6302: ~~maybe i should make a shoot-to-move~~
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: you can interpret the theme however you want  and you will be able to justify why it fits the theme when you add it to the jam
 Cearáj#9556: oh don't worry I'm not saying I can't use it, the person there just mentioned they were in an old version and felt the difference
 brazmogu#3238: the one you know how to use
 Beeg scarf#3571: yeah you should make your game finishable in 10 min max as most people are gonna want to check out all the other games
 Ahat#0842: do u think that a game where ur in a cafe for dice would fit the theme?
 Cearáj#9556: I remember I started on godot 3.2, can remember a few great subtle changes since then still
 MangoWorks#1202: i feel like no one is going to have the attention span to play my game
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: not that I'm aware but if you don't upload game you have to rate an amount of random games before you can pick the ones you want to plat
 Cearáj#9556: wow that's epic
 Pygocentrus#8974: I don't usually code
 Beeg scarf#3571: Jailbreaking mario world of course
 shuhai#8582: I have an idea, but I'm not sure if he's good enough, you need to play other characters to change the outcome of DICE, can anyone give me feedback?
 JelyMe#2483: Imagine having more than a character controller and an enemy running around as squares
 brazmogu#3238: oh, yea but I'm like trying to use argument types in the function declarations and that just won't do in 3.0
 Pygocentrus#8974: Whats the best programming language
 Ahat#0842: godot isnt that hard to learn, pretty easy once u get that hang of it
 Beeg scarf#3571: embed fail
 brazmogu#3238: So remember when I gave that general advice about updating your tools before the jam starts, well I just realized I've been using Godot 3.3 in another PC for so long I forgot this one had 3.0 and it's different in so many subtle ways
 Indigu#6862: That's a good way to make sure you make bad progress. 100% proper deep work for 3 hours is much more valuable than 8 hours of whatever keeps you up awake, headaches and feeling miserable.
 toilet gin (Rip Techno)#8501: do you have to join the game jam to rate games?
 Ahat#0842: just saying, the  channel should stay open when the jam is over so we can hype the next jam
 blltdgr#4722: I got my dice to roll randomly so I think that's a good start!
 Lukey#6052: my code is being naughty and im sad so imma have a 5 minute break (grab some water, lie down, etc)
 Ahat#0842: at my school one teacher did some game design courses, used gmtk vids alot, really want to show him what i made for this jam when school starts back up
 Ceding Tree#1081: My game is going to be essentiallly 4 scenes. A Main menu, a Game over screen, a Shop scene, and a battle scene.
 Minimg#8623: ^ this
 Beeg scarf#3571: yueah
 Ahat#0842: tommorow im gonna be working all day to get a demo finished
 MaryStrawberry#4672: mods can I submit two games?
 Minimg#8623: Sleep > Not sleeping, You will make more progress with the energy you get from resting, as opposed to using those 8 hours developing more stuff, and then being tired the whole next day
 Ahat#0842: barely made progress today, just learned godot and did my player
 Technically Insane#9013: yea, i have ONE main mechanic, and its pretty robust, im liking the feel of having less but more meaningful mechanics
 Ceding Tree#1081: 💯
 Ahat#0842: was thinking of quiting, cheanged my mind
 Ceding Tree#1081: So true. If you feel like you need to get back to work, try taking power naps. I try to take 3 naps that are 2 hours each throughout the day instead of one long sleep
 Minimg#8623: Yeah my expectation in the first few hours was wayyy too high, I’ve now had to redesign mechanics to fit within the scope of the jam
 Michel#2879: Personally I become more creative when I am sleepy
 Ceding Tree#1081: I just made some bullS*** account for Visual Studio. Although, if you have never used C# to program it  might take too long to make something for the game jam
 Technically Insane#9013: ive heard that before, plus ive gotten about half my games code done
 Michel#2879: I think Simplicity is the most important
then functionality
then look
Don't higher you expectations too much tho
 nekotheasparagus#0809: My advice is don’t
Sleep is VERY important for creating. More time doesn’t mean anything if your brain is running at half-power for the duration
 Minimg#8623: Thanks for the help everyone, really appreciate it! ♥️
 Ceding Tree#1081: I think minimalism is the way to go for a game jam. Polish when the jam is done if you like what you have made!
 Unclouded#9240: microsoft wants my account to use visual studio
 Lukey#6052: A, always A. As A Sentient Stalk of Asparagus said already, better to have a fun game than an unfun game.
 Technically Insane#9013: im tryna stay awake the whole jam-
 Minimg#8623: Sometime tomorrow sure, currently getting ready to sleep after an interesting first day
 MangoWorks#1202: I think B
 Ceding Tree#1081: In my opinion? More A.
 nekotheasparagus#0809: 100% A. A fun game that is ugly is still a fun game. And unfun game that looks good is an unfun game
 Technically Insane#9013: functionality
 MangoWorks#1202: im at the state where im doing a lot but non of it connects
 Michel#2879: Although I personally prefer to do everything from Scratch. I don't trust Unity that much💀
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: I came up with a title and what to make!  My project is now called "Random Randomizer" and the idea is based off of randomized games, but in this case, before you get to the randomized point you have to roll a dice to see what kind of random player character/item/encounter/event will happen...
 Minimg#8623: Hey! Quick question since currently I’m in a bit of an awkward spot
Should I
A: focus more on functionality and less art / polish
B: Try and do more polished stuff but have less and worse functionality
Thank you!
 Ceding Tree#1081: Hmmm.....never seen anything like that to be honest! I use Unity, its free and there are a million tutorials for whatever you can think of
 Technically Insane#9013: anyone wanna vc while we code/develop, i need someone to talk to ;-;
 Michel#2879: I think Unity already has a tool for path finding
 AZOTh the Creator#7094: thx ill do my best🥲
 Ceding Tree#1081: Yeah, I was gonna do pictures liike runes and stuff, but then realized thats outside my scope for the time I have to complete the project
 MangoWorks#1202: you are all out here with ways to represent a dice my dice is just a function that no one can see 🤣
 nekotheasparagus#0809: Ooh that’s neat! Sadly I don’t use Fusion so can’t offer help, but I hope you can get it started soon! If you haven’t tried uninstalling then reinstalling that might be worth a shot if it won’t mess up any projects, and finding a fusion discord/forum can get you more help with your issue. While you’re troubleshooting, you can always use paper and pencil to design different aspect until you get fusion to work. Best of luck ^-^
 snares#8483: anything that invokes the theme works
 ATaco#6690: Also might be worth considering using the "Die" pun
 Ceding Tree#1081: good luck, you can do it!
 Minus#1843: No, it would be good to make something that is not clearly dice related, and still is quite fun with "roll the dice", just saying but warhammer or dnd is also very well known and related to dices 🙃
 Low Rider#5938: yeah I was kinda thinking the same idea there. Like a dice with pictures instead of numbers
 AZOTh the Creator#7094: im going to part time job rn🥲 hope i can finish my game
 Ceding Tree#1081: what programing language does that use?
 dangertimmy#8239: I'm probably just incorporating luck based elements
 Unclouded#9240: fusion (the engine im using) wont let me work
 Ðazed♡#8249: yoo dani, funny seeing you here!!
 Ceding Tree#1081: not at all, im using a fake dice. Like, its just colors no numbers
 dangertimmy#8239: def not!
 Low Rider#5938: do you guys think that a real dice, like dice art, is necessary to fit the theme
 Beeg scarf#3571: this guy gets it
 Ceding Tree#1081: Sounds good, I say go for it
 Unclouded#9240: but i cant work on it because fusion isnt letting me do shit
 Lukey#6052: ok gone unity is gone gone time to reload it and hope i remembered to save often
 just the dani#8008: bro I can't even get enemies to follow the player correctly rip
 Pygocentrus#8974: Good thing I have a very high performance laptop
 Unclouded#9240: my game idea
you are some stick figure guy with a dice gun
when ever you shoot it you shoot a bullet with the damage of 1-6
your gun does random damage, if you do way more damage then you need too the enemy will blow up 
 Ceding Tree#1081: 48 hours = day 1 + day 2 + day 3 XD
 Lukey#6052: gahdamnit unity wont even let me close it. time for task manager :[
 nekotheasparagus#0809: Final day should be “submit a copy that works”, then polish, then if you get the polish submit that
 Michel#2879: my Pc is making weird sounds
 MangoWorks#1202: the 3rd day is rushing in panic
 Beeg scarf#3571: first day: idea
second day: game
final day: polish
 nekotheasparagus#0809: Ah, still, looks like you got a few hours of sleep and are good to get going! Some of us got the theme as soon as it started and have been working all day still to have no ideas
 MangoWorks#1202: the 2nd day is adding stuff
 Lukey#6052: unity is *still* frozen. I think my potato laptop has run out of resources
 Occelot Dan#3777: You got this, friend! Lots of folks here willing to talk through ideas, especially in 
 ATaco#6690: `BABA ISNT YOU`
 MangoWorks#1202: i spend the first day of every jam just getting the pieces of the game
 ConstantDerivative#6302: no i was awake at 2 am and slept at 3 but i couldnt think of any game ideas except for 1 terrible one
 Avian Overlord#3191: Well, I've gotten to the point where the player can pick up dice and throw them. It doesn't change their face yet, and I still need to figure out how exactly to use them gameplay-wise, but seeing something work at all in one day is still really satisfying.
 nekotheasparagus#0809: Nothing wrong with that. Sleep is very important for jams, you just happened to be sleeping at the start rather than several hours after
 ConstantDerivative#6302: and this is my first game jam and i am terrible at coming up with ideas oh god
 Ceding Tree#1081: Yes, but its time for bed here where I am, so now you have 8 hours to work while I sleep!
 Lukey#6052: u n i t y      **froze**
 Beeg scarf#3571: yknow, wether or not i get my idea to work i think i lose nothing by making a menu while am at it
 ThatIsANoNoWord#5311: Is spinning 2d dice technically rolling?
 MangoWorks#1202: i kinda had a bunch of ideas planned before and one of them just matched up
 Occelot Dan#3777: Oh that is such a good idea!
 Bifrost_Gaurdian#7562: I'm making a game that involves rolling dice
 Lukey#6052: nononononononoNONONONONONONONONONNO unity is frozewn
 ConstantDerivative#6302: i still dont have a game idea, i am way behind (the theme announcement was at 2 am so my brain wasnt working and i just woke up)
 MangoWorks#1202: but there might eb a dice item
 nekotheasparagus#0809: Honestly I’m excited to see all the dice being rolled- I know there will be quite a few who will have literal rolling dice and I wanna see what everyone designs
 Ðazed♡#8249: i have a slight idea tho idk how i would implement the dice rolling into gameplay
but its at least an idea
 MangoWorks#1202: im using the dice as a metaphor
 MikeHazeJr#6582: So I took way too long making a physical dice roll, but I'm super happy with the result. Time to build the levels. 🙂
 TheChronicPhenix#1205: Yea definitely submit whatever you've got if it runs at all, can always get some feedback on what's there
 sqrt#9237: is it even possible to make a game without crunching at all?
 MangoWorks#1202: i feel like im making a good game
 nekotheasparagus#0809: If it runs go ahead and submit your incomplete game! I did that last jam and now have some great feedback for when I eventually use the gameplay as a base for an actual game
 Ceding Tree#1081: 💯
 MangoWorks#1202: why does GMTK Jam feel like a week long
 Zag#6205: It doesn’t matter if you finish, just as long as you are motivated to complete it another time, and it is also a good experience
 Unclouded#9240: does anyone here use Fusion 2.5
i really need help
 wren#0640: i always use the previous level as a base so i can visibly see that its harder than the previous level, allows for a better difficulty curve imo
 Tsunami#0963: same, i mean we only have 40 hours left and i havnt even slept yet.
 nekotheasparagus#0809: A template level is lovely
 Occelot Dan#3777: Honestly from a technical aspect you can also just clone the poop out of your tutorial level once you have it complete to save time on your later levels lol
 Zag#6205: Mine
 Glitch#1483: Thanks! Hopefully it will work
 Ceding Tree#1081: Why not?
 Pygocentrus#8974: Mine but I don't think I will finish
 Ceding Tree#1081: anybody elses first game jam?
 wren#0640: i knoww i knoww i was mostly joking, but when teaching mechanics you generally dont have to create a "catch" so its far more simple and allows you to bump up the level count for free lol
 Pygocentrus#8974: That software would be incredibly helpful
 Glitch#1483: No. Just when ever you're free
 nekotheasparagus#0809: Baba is you is my favorite game - it handles so many aspects of the puzzles well, and it challenging but not “what the heck how was I supposed to figure that out???”
 spoofshot#3082: I wouldn't consider them cop out levels by any stretch. They're still useful in teaching concepts in your game!
 Jasper#7906: Alright, found the problem, completed my before-bed goals, so off to bed it is
 Glitch#1483: I would really appreciate it if some of you could complete this survey for me. It is for a school assignment and is completely anonymous. I understand everyone’s mid-way through a game jam (because I am too), if you still want to help me out though you can save the link and complete it later. Thanks😀
 Mattstov(Matt) ⃤#8596: like in the baba is you gmtk vid :D
 wren#0640: because i decided to teach both regular sokoban mechanics and my dice sokoban mechanic i get to have 2 cop out tutorial levels >:)
 Lawn#1538: Because you may have more responses after it.
 Lawn#1538: Does it need to be completed during the jam?
 nekotheasparagus#0809: I actually thought that video was going to go into true vs pseudo random first time I saw it, but it was actually about letting the player have some control in what is happening if that makes sense
 Occelot Dan#3777: For folks working on puzzle games, it may help to consider making one full puzzle to start, and then a "tutorial" puzzle to teach mechanics. That way, even if you run out of time, you have a full proof of concept with those two levels.
 Pygocentrus#8974: I might need to rewatch that video I watched a while back
 Mattstov(Matt) ⃤#8596: time to rewatch
 Ceding Tree#1081: So without spoiling my whole game concept, I'm drawing heavily on the mario party style dice "roll". A little bit of RNG, but mostly it just "seems" like RNG
 Leon the Artist#6349: Hi all. Good luck with your projects
 Lawn#1538: Annoying random is annoying.
 Lawn#1538: Focus on the fun random.
 nekotheasparagus#0809: Ooh it’s the video about annoying random and fun random ^-^
 Mattstov(Matt) ⃤#8596: keep going you got this, you got a good mindset
 Shroomax#3378: i got like 3 already, sometimes i think bigwig softwares do this intentionally (premier, unity etc etc)
 Ceding Tree#1081: It is time.....
 Minus#1843: First unity crash of the day, HELL YEAH
 Shroomax#3378: A lot more to do, and not that much time left
 Ricky#5210: Lol I'm so worried the puzzle design is going to take more time than it should for mine
 Lawn#1538: A reminder that Mark did a video that might help inspire you.
 Ilias L#2942: Optimistic for now.
I should have the main loop together by the end of night 1.
Night 2 will be all polish and difficulty modes
 Unclouded#9240: shit, fusion isnt working
 wren#0640: im really fucking happy with mines so far, main bottleneck is that puzzle design is Hard Actually
 Shroomax#3378: i got another idea, a shooter where your bullets are decided by the dice/randomness, but each dice roll costs something, and if you are out of that currency and bullets, you ded
its kind of like aarcade scoring system
 Ceding Tree#1081: Feelin good, how about you? I've gotten through the planning phase with a small idea board, and now I'm onto coding the mechanics
 toiletsnakes#0869: My MMORPG with branching path conversation and crafting is gonna be sicc
 Scolon#4218: I'm really excited right now but slightly unsure if I'll get to finish everything on time.
If worst comes to worst I'll cut some content for a bit of extra polish
 Zag#6205: I have a great idea but not enough time to work on it, Guess I’m pulling some all nighters :/
 R4zorcl4w77#9100: despite the fact that its generic im actusaly getting excited bc i think i can switch ot up with some cool mechanics (ooohh, i just got some ideas for awesome bosses too)
 Mattstov(Matt) ⃤#8596: hows everyone feelin bout their games?
 Ðazed♡#8249: i have a slight idea now tbh tho idk what else to do then "command prompt with a randomise command" 🤷
 Cearáj#9556: I see, thanks for the advice!
 Scolon#4218: Yeah if you're stuck just go with any idea even if it doesn't feel that great. You'll probably get more ideas to flesh it out and make it more unique as you go along
 R4zorcl4w77#9100: high key i might do a top down shooter lol, i actually have a pretty good idea for it
 toiletsnakes#0869: Ok here’s an idea. Spherical dice. And somehow, the direction of each numbered face matters. Maybe when scoring or something
 Unclouded#9240: does anyone use fusion 2.5
 Ilias L#2942: Imo if your stuck, it's best to start getting the productivity going early. It will send the brain into jam mode which might start generating ideas. Sitting around being stuck ain't the best.
 Occelot Dan#3777: The  channel has a ton of good discussion around ideas, if you're still looking for your concept that may help!
 Ceding Tree#1081: I feel like I dont know how to game dev, and thats my actual paid job if that helps motivate you XD
Just find an idea, anything at all, and start there. The biggest challenge is actually making something 😛
 Lawn#1538: Then just do that. Focus on the game not the theme.
 toiletsnakes#0869: Pro tip a 4 dimensional dice has 24 sides
 Jellogramming#4653: I'm gonna go to sleep now
 Pygocentrus#8974: I am still struggling with ideas
 nekotheasparagus#0809: I would say that’s not a good idea, I would start thinking of different things that relate to “Roll of the Dice”
As an example, luck doesn’t involve dice, a game with luck as a mechanic fits the theme
 FryDev#0372: my goal in the jam was just to make a really good game
 Shroomax#3378: you better never let it go.
you only get two days, do not miss your chance to develop
this jam comes once in a year yo
 Cearáj#9556: oof, any tips for me who hasn't gamedev'd fr in like half a year?
 Ceding Tree#1081: When you sign up for a game jam just to sit in discord and chat with the stranger homies
 Jasper#7906: choices, choices. I'm close to done with the goals I set for myself for before going to bed. It's also bedtime...
 Lawn#1538: I’m excited to see concepts with no dice at all.
 Shroomax#3378: i heard this quote today, some of y'all may relate
"there are a lot of fishes in the sea. but it doesn't matter if you can't fish"
 Pygocentrus#8974: I am excited to see games that use a d20 since most of what I have seen has been d6s
 Ceding Tree#1081: You better lose yourself, in the game jam
 R4zorcl4w77#9100: yessir, these are true facts
 Ilias L#2942: I more so mean if you have no ideas
 Occelot Dan#3777: You got this! We believe in you!
 williamdoro#8857: i just signed up to trello thanks for mentioning it
 sqrt#9237: sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak
And when you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up
But you got to search within you, and try to find that inner strength
And just pull that shit out of you
And get that motivation to not give up, and not be a quitter
No matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse
 Lawn#1538: You don’t need to have dice in a literal sense.
 Lawn#1538: I feel like we’re going to see a lot of gambling and roguelike card games this year.
 FryDev#0372: fair enough
 nekotheasparagus#0809: None of my ideas involve programming dice haha
 Shroomax#3378: you never know where your idea will sprout from
 Ilias L#2942: If your struggling and don't have dice programmed, start making dice. Ideas might come to while getting those ready
 Chowdog 宗翰#0135: I might do that too lul
 Ceding Tree#1081: Thats how you know your a true game dev. You just gotta be burnt out on everything, and learn to push past that
 Scolon#4218: I'm currently designing my enemies
I also have so many things in the "Nice To Have" category on my trello, hopefully I have time to get toe m
 williamdoro#8857: someone make discord gc for ppl with no idea lol
 Shroomax#3378: just go for a walk, i got my idea in the bathroom
 Lawn#1538: This is the way.
 Cearáj#9556: I might just make a generic top down shooter last hour lma
 FryDev#0372: I think I’m just burnt out on game dev or something
 maxbox360#7946: Y'ALL GOT THIS 👏
 Lawn#1538: Welcome to da club.
 nekotheasparagus#0809: I’m still putting all my ideas in a notebook. Glad I did because one idea was awful when I tried to design the level lol
 Ceding Tree#1081: Games that use dice to draw ideas from: Monopoly, Mario Party, ummmmmm......other games XD
 Cearáj#9556: man, I'm struggling as well
 FryDev#0372: I don’t even have an idea
 Shroomax#3378: yeah but, but but the lulz, i gotta do it for the mems
 williamdoro#8857: have you done 9 hours yet?
 sqrt#9237: how will we finish a game in such a short time
 R4zorcl4w77#9100: i had one but it was too ambitious so i had to scrap it, im still thinkin
 Ceding Tree#1081: Dont do it FryDev, I believe in you!
 williamdoro#8857: i code from 9.30 - 18.30
 Shroomax#3378: my school starts in 5 weeks so i have the entire time lol
 Ilias L#2942: You should sleep, the more you rest the more you will get done
 Mythic#7803: yea
 Lukey#6052: there is a smol 5% of me that wants to change ideas and scrap my ENTIRE project, but uhhhhhh iskfineaoiiomomL{<F<@{Q:F{H{H#... [-Rebooting-]
 williamdoro#8857: i am so lucky that school starts in 3 days
 Shroomax#3378: yeah that's true
~~~sleep is for the weak~~
 chillvibes#1248: 8 hours straight and finally got all main mechanics done now to fix bugs for the next 24 hours
 FryDev#0372: I think I might throw in the towel
 Mythic#7803: well imma go now i have school and after that i need to work for atleast 8-10 hours so that i don't lag behind
 Shroomax#3378: or i can call it a night
 Pygocentrus#8974: There is still a entire day sleep is important
 Shroomax#3378: i don't sleep tonight and work my ass of to do this. tbh i can still create that, i've got my platformer done
 williamdoro#8857: u continue ur game and adapt to that concept
 maxbox360#7946: Yes, this one
 graygray#8956: I offered that idea a while back, 6 different genres roll for each level
 Shroomax#3378: UNLESS!
 Lukey#6052: 9 hours in and I've realised my idea is kinda bad and I'm struggling to implement some basic features
 FryDev#0372: I recommend it
 maxbox360#7946: I feel like there was a similar game highlighted within the last few years
 williamdoro#8857: its because unity is class based vomit (no offense to unity users)
 Lukey#6052: oh god
 williamdoro#8857: but the whole point is that it is luck based (though i suppose the computer's randomisation sometimes bugs out and returns the same value like 3 times)
 Cearáj#9556: I've only played the jam version but that one is on my wishlist, I might get it someday after I actually play other titles waiting on my library
 OrangeKingdom#9769: **I want to find a knight character**
 BBB#7952: How do i do movement
 L1ttel_Y#7220: Isn't that because Unreal 5?
 sqrt#9237: are you making 6 genres in 1 game in 2 days ?
think shroomax . think!
 FryDev#0372: there was a game like that for the 2020 gmtk where you rapidly are flipping between genres
 Mythic#7803: same  but i am using it for first time
 Mythic#7803: thats a good idea
 OrangeKingdom#9769: I am going to create a plattformer game that you can win without the dice but with the dice you can win it easily but if you are unlucky then it can be more harder
 williamdoro#8857: EUREKA MOMENT for u lol (sad that its wrong timing)
 tykenn#8548: oops, replied to the wrong person
 FryDev#0372: the non-jam Wrong Dimension There is No Game version is actually pretty good
 williamdoro#8857: i am going to have to figure out mass image blit() to screen (i'm using python)
 Shroomax#3378: i just realized.
i could've made a game where you change game genre each dice roll smh
 maxbox360#7946: Game is None
 wren#0640: oh also the damage would have to reset to the middle value after a timer i think? because you could just get lucky, get the max damage and dominate the whole game
 Cearáj#9556: I've only played the jam version
 tykenn#8548: There Is No Game is actually a pretty fun game
 Shroomax#3378: based
 wyrm_slayr#7477: Fine, then I'd run in circles rolling
 tykenn#8548: probably a mix of both. I'm trying to make everything myself, but this is getting exhausting
 R4zorcl4w77#9100: same xD
 Cearáj#9556: nah, the easiest game is "there is no game" because there is no game
 maxbox360#7946: you'd probably have to make enemies pretty aggressive then huh?
 sqrt#9237: cookie clicker
 wren#0640: i feel like it would have to be a collectable that shows up every now and then for this exact reason
 williamdoro#8857: my own scuffed assets
 Shroomax#3378: in my opinion, the easiest game is press the button
 R4zorcl4w77#9100: holy i am making no progress lol
 Scolon#4218: It really depends on a lot of factors
 OrangeKingdom#9769: **Are you guys going to create your own assets or get from the internet**
 Beeg scarf#3571: clicker i agree with, top down shooter not so much so
 wyrm_slayr#7477: I'd just hide in a corner rolling till I get the highest possible number Lol
 Mythic#7803: top-down imo
 Cearáj#9556: top-down shooter
 williamdoro#8857: clicker is easier
 maxbox360#7946: ooooooooo
 Shroomax#3378: ~~make cuphead~~
 Beeg scarf#3571: isnt a platformer virtually the easiest kind of video game you could make
 wren#0640: im not making it but i had the idea of a shoot em up where every now and then you can roll a dice to change your attack damage, but it could be *lower* than what you had before giving a reasonable point to not using the dice rolls so someone can take that if theyre stumped
 Mythic#7803: i was thinking of making a platformer but i don't have time so i have gone for games that we actually play with a dice and then make it a bit different
 maxbox360#7946: This but on a die
 Beeg scarf#3571: im doing one where you play as a dice that rolls dkc style
 maxbox360#7946: Sometimes you just fuckin' fall through lol
 wyrm_slayr#7477: I thought it would be interesting to make a platformer where every time you jump, the die lands on a different face causing a unique effect
 Shroomax#3378: i am currently building a platformer lol, you roll a dice that gives you buffs or punishments, you might need to take some risks or play it safe
 krisis in a jar#0904: My hand hurts so bad from coding ong
 Occelot Dan#3777: Good one, I'm rolling with laughter
 sqrt#9237: if you could just, for one minute
 Lukey#6052: hehe
 tykenn#8548: There's going to be thousands of games with anthropomorphic die people, and then a few with a something way out there like "troll of the dyson sphere" or something
 maxbox360#7946: Randomly flip, randomly twirl
 Chowdog 宗翰#0135: 200 IQ moment
 Cearáj#9556: platformer where you kill dice (they roll when they *die* (haha get it (please laugh)))
 wren#0640: i assure you theres gonna be a lot of platformers submitted
 Mythic#7803: man i am able to think ideas for other games but not a single for me 😭
 6746#9763: Unity is losing a lot of users. Maybe Godot will finally get a chance to shine.
 maxbox360#7946: Platforms randomly switch states of some material idk lol
 Mythic#7803: maybe there are rolling dice in the platformer
 Shroomax#3378: aw crap. seems like unity made another bad decision
 wyrm_slayr#7477: Make the main character a die, boom.
 Ðazed♡#8249: eh i mean i rly dont see how a platformer would fit the theme
 Mythic#7803: i will have school after this so i will be not able to work on the game for 6 hours
 Scolon#4218: I'm cutting some corners in my code since this is a game jam
But if I do any sort of post-jam updates I'm definitely recoding some things
 maxbox360#7946: Be strong comrade
 Occelot Dan#3777: Let's gooooo 🤘
 Danny Dan Dan#6699: I can feel the tired creeping in, I think I should call it a night lol
 Cearáj#9556: based
 Mythic#7803: wise words :D
 wyrm_slayr#7477: My code has reached the point that should legally require a safety warning before viewing. I shudder to think what it will be like at the end of the jam...
 Cearáj#9556: hmm
 GentleRedemptor#3608: well this is a blast from the past
 Niba#7306: If you have the right mindset, EVERY idea fits the theme 😎
 Danny Dan Dan#6699: Roll like a roll cake?
 Cearáj#9556: then roll it?
 Beeg scarf#3571: it probably does, if it doesnt you can do it anyways iirc
 Endorth#5797: my game is crazy hard and absurd 🤣
 Mythic#7803: this increases my scope :D
 Cearáj#9556: yeah uh I don't really play games that have a lot of that so makes sense I can't imagine my ideas being fun
 Scolon#4218: cards huh...
I think I just found my inspiration for my cast of enemies
 Ðazed♡#8249: i might have just thought of an idea tho it doesnt fit the theme
 Danny Dan Dan#6699: The way I've interpreted it is by thinking about a dice as an object with distinct faces and unique values, and from there thinking about rotating (or "rolling") it to different effects
 wren#0640: I really like this theme tbh
 USER#8646: Im thinking of it being about resource management and making decisions
 Hobusu#5033: 'dicing' as in food (Mark confirmed this was a valid interpretation when someone asked about it)
 Mythic#7803: ok i have decided on an idea
 Beeg scarf#3571: i got a cool basic movement done but i dont know where to go from here
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: dice
cards
randomness
percentages
taking risks
unknown outcomes
 Cearáj#9556: or maybe a game where you need skillz to throw it or sth
 Chowdog 宗翰#0135: This feel like the theme is just a more narrow version of out of control
 sendhelpidfk#6700: again depends how you execute on it
are there additional mechanics? how does the game present itself to the player? 
 tykenn#8548: Yeah, you work a metaphorical dice roll into just about anything
 Scolon#4218: I had a ton of ideas for this theme right off the bat
Honestly surprised  that a lot of people are going for similar ideas
 null_ham#2050: the only thing you could do is something with randomness
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I'm really surprised that people think its limiting
 USER#8646: Do you think its better to give players specific rolls and have them try to win or let them play and just say that the goal is to get the fewest possible
 Mythic#7803: well a dice roll makes us think of number b/w 1-6
 null_ham#2050: yeah i really dont like this theme since its so limiting
 sendhelpidfk#6700: or that there's at least a reasonably new autosave
 williamdoro#8857: ye me 2
 Cearáj#9556: yea uh idk if it's just my brain that doesn't want to work with it
 Chowdog 宗翰#0135: On top of my head all I can think of is dice roll into random number etc
 williamdoro#8857: easier for newer devs though
 sendhelpidfk#6700: depends how you execute on it
 USER#8646: Do you think a game which everyone can easily beat eventually but is about beating it in the fewest amount of rounds (dice rolls) could be fun
 SirRana#9966: Limiting is good :]
 Scolon#4218: Just think outside the box a bit more
 NotExplosive#0002: idk who needs to hear this but: make a simpler game
 Chowdog 宗翰#0135: Anyone feel like this year's theme is a little limiting
 sqrt#9237: am scared😬
 sendhelpidfk#6700: oh boy bsod while gms2 was saving, time to _roll the dice_ on whether or not my jam game is just corrupted now
 williamdoro#8857: is there a genre you do well in, like platformers, clickers, or puzzle games?
 Mythic#7803: same here
 Ðazed♡#8249: henlo game jammers :3 hope yall's games are goin well!! im still tryna think of an idea lol
 williamdoro#8857: i just woke up lol
 TheChronicPhenix#1205: Oh wow, impressive
 Zixon7#3892: I finished everything except sound
and art :p
 sbubby#4885: i'm going to sleep rn
 Mythic#7803: i got to know the theme at night and after that i slept immediately
 Muffy#2153: Oh god I'm at the time where I feel like I bit off more than I can chew and there's no way I can make a presentable product in time 🙃
 tykenn#8548: I got a lot set up for my multiversal escape room, but it doesn't look like much yet
 Mythic#7803: i don't even have an idea
 SockPoppet#6054: I finished the player's sprite sheet 😛
 d4r3k#2238: same here
 TheChronicPhenix#1205: How are people's projects coming along?
 Mythic#7803: i need to start now
 mickychin#7933: 
 maxbox360#7946: any good streams of people making stuff for the jam?
 Hinduballer#3246: Anyone need a artist and animator?
 Ty4ft31#0767: b
 mickychin#7933: is casino allowed like in the game ofc
 Freast#9278: finally had some inspiration strike!
... now there is a cube
 toiletsnakes#0869: this theme...................is hard to come up with ideas for. but know when the results come in there'll be plenty of kick ass games w/ amazing ideas
 darlingS#1797: I wish it was warmer here (Australian winter, way too much rain)
 Michel#2879: I usually stay until 5 AM tho. to avoid the hot hours of the morning (middleeastren weather)
 Scolon#4218: Currently looking at my Trello board, yeah I got quite a lot done too. Ton of art to do now though
 darlingS#1797: It feels like two days for me because I had to wake up at 1 am to see the theme when it was announced
 Michel#2879: Amma watch some PewDiePie and sleep.
 Michel#2879: Actually the game jam started a little after mid day so it feels like 3 days to me
 Jellogramming#4653: I'm surprised I got as much done as I did today
 Sandra#4621: (I know that I have had my vehement disagreements with mark's opinions in the past.)
 sendhelpidfk#6700: ah yes i too have definitely finished mine
 Fraserfatt#1021: man, 8 hour stream FLEW by
 Danny Dan Dan#6699: Same 😂
 Chowdog 宗翰#0135: People from east Asia probably just starting now lol including me
 Sandra#4621: gmtk videos give you some tools, but you don't need to use them to make a good game (oftentimes they're representative of mark's personal preference for "good" rather than anything objective too)
 dangertimmy#8239: yall its okay I'm just sitting down to start now hahaha
 Michel#2879: I like how I went from "it's been hours and I've only made a rolling dice" to "who tf did I do all of these so fast"
 Splinter of Chaos#9089: It's an aspect of many good--but not all--puzzle games rather than a principle to follow. The big thing is just to try to not derive challenge only from combinatoric explosion (as the puzzle grows, the number of actions possible increases: that's combinatorics).
 Scolon#4218: Breaking "rules" and trends will probably get you something more unique anyways
 USER#8646: Ok
 Scolon#4218: There's no rules behind creating a "good game", you can do whatever you want really
 USER#8646: Does a good puzzle game need to follow nhe principles of assumption, catch, revelation or can it be more open ended
 fairydust#7188: alright thanks! looks like i actually did sign up for it but i forgot lol
 Scolon#4218: I made sure I didn't overscope on this
 Lukey#6052: oh god people are already finishing their main mechanics
 Scolon#4218: Mechanics are finished now, just need to add content and juice
 Lukey#6052: yeah either that or think of it as a minigame or something small like that
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Yeah absolutely but rather than thinking about make "a whole game" its good to think of it as a protoype or vertical slice
 ChichoRD#0598: Ok, thank you
 Xernas78#5400: i'm french and in france it's 2AM sooooooooooooooooo
 fairydust#7188: do we need to sign up for the jam somewhere or is it enough to just submit the game?
 ChichoRD#0598: Like a character gets injured and says *shit*
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: We're allowed to swear in this server so I assume that would be ok
 Zag#6205: Yes for instance I started my idea as only a small concept and built up until I reached a place I would be happy continuing after the game jam
 ChichoRD#0598: Question: Are my game characters allowed to swear, like in a cutscene or something, despite the rules (No NSFW) of the jam?
 1Am2Good4You#4414:  but people need to give their games some "juice" too
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: remember to think of your project as "making a prototype" for a game that could be created. It usually helps with scope
 1Am2Good4You#4414:  well the bulk of it will be code not necessarily game content xD
 Portland.Horton#3845:  that is quite ambitious! I hope to see it done!
 1Am2Good4You#4414:  Lol I am trying to both make a big game, and make it multiplayer (first ever attempt at it too)
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824:  or 
 Portland.Horton#3845: That's fair. That's what i'm trying to do but again, I've made one other game so we'll see if I can manage a whole game in less then 2 days now
 ThatIsANoNoWord#5311: It’s also mainly the type of game I make
 Ber#3410: can somebody please help with music
 ThatIsANoNoWord#5311: I wanted to do a platformer but top down feels so much easier
 1Am2Good4You#4414: yeah I am gonna leave a dice themed thing in the game but I don't want it to be like literally 99% of the other games
 GreenBWW#9006: sounds cool
 ThatIsANoNoWord#5311: I’m thinking about your enemies being spinning dice and which side you hit determining a difference on death effect
 Minus#1843: I once used PC as a dice, it was rolling if it is going to work or not after falling on stairs - it works xD
 Lukey#6052: you took a spin, literally ;D
 Portland.Horton#3845: Ayy oh that's my guy!
 1Am2Good4You#4414: I took a spin on everyone doing dice stuff. I'm using bingo balls 😉
 Minus#1843: add also Dice of Accelration - fling player in random direction with rolled force
 Gabriel [BluishGreenPro]#5666: "Well begun is half done" having spent 7 hours planning our game, we'll see how much that helps with development :/
 Portland.Horton#3845: I got one about a guy with split personality disorder that I'm going to attempt
 borboss#7877: i just realized how much i probably have to cut from my game
definitely overthought this and had too big of an idea
 Lukey#6052: instead of focusing on my main important systems I added a 'Dice of Death' and 'Dice of Life' which can add random debuffs or buffs (depending on which one you get)
 1Am2Good4You#4414: no game ideas then?
 Portland.Horton#3845: I'm still figuring that out. He used unity and I only godot
 1Am2Good4You#4414:  what are ya doing?
 Portland.Horton#3845: Developer got burnout already so I'm going to attempt to do it myself. Wish me luck
 ApolloPlease#1777: I may be making a fool of myself but that's roughly what I'd do
 ApolloPlease#1777: transform.lookat
 TheRayvenn#0001: I used that, it's not making the player look towards the mouse that's the problem, it's moving the player towards the mouse. It spins in circles and stuff
 ApolloPlease#1777:  there's a method called mousetoworldspace
 TheRayvenn#0001: It's fine I already gave up 🥲
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I just fucking burnt myself getting food out of the oven 😦
 Minus#1843: can you explain what you want to achieve  exactly? Be it on  or in DM, maybe I can help somehow
 1Am2Good4You#4414: UI game? I assume?
 TheRayvenn#0001: it was 2D
 TheRayvenn#0001: I tried everything bro 😭
 Minus#1843: alright, time to really do some work 😂 I need to make my character use his sword, and not just walk around
 ApolloPlease#1777: Lol
 1Am2Good4You#4414:  look up any youtube tutorial
 TheRayvenn#0001: After hours of trying to get the player to look and move towards the mouse, I gave up on unity. I'm going back to python
 1Am2Good4You#4414: I'm not even joking. Onenote would be good alt choice
 Ricky#5210: I've been using Miro and it's pretty solid (see my last post in  lol)
 Xalph555#5377: Miro could be useful
 Minus#1843: oh yeah, if I had one I'd use that too 🤔
 Cearáj#9556: the paper
 alexp#7720: I personally really like Notion
 1Am2Good4You#4414: i use my brain
 Jellogramming#4653: milanote
 Minus#1843: well we use google jamboard
 (유)니티 좋음/나찰 니티#7281: I use trello But you can't do pictures
 CoolRyan#6539: hey guys - what's a good digital white board / design space for throwing up a bunch of media, screen grabs, youtube, spotify, whatever links - to quickly sketch out like visual art themes or whatever - game dev focused . . . what do peeps in the community use?
 DevKoala#3849: imagine a cooking game where rolling diced meats or veggies will determine the amount of tips you get from customers
 Minus#1843: that would be UR card in PIGS gacha system, not sure what would it be worth, but take it '-'
 DevKoala#3849: hmmm the theme is roll of the dice
but what if you roll diced pig meat
 sendhelpidfk#6700: stephen's sausage roll but instead of sausages it's dice and instead of dice it's pigs
and instead of grills it's idk mud
 Minus#1843: or join us in magnificent talk about pigs - choice is yours
 Moloch#1312: Same boat, chief. set an alarm for the theme to be announced. Didn't actually turn the alarm on.
 Xalph555#5377: thnx alarm i set incorrectly, i only just woke up XD - better get to work
 Minus#1843: alright, jam randomness: check, we're supposed to make games, but well... pigs are also interesting topic :V
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: its called contributing the the conversation
 CALSYTHE#6648: just as there are millions of ways to make games about gardening or dice or attacking things with guns or swords
 Minus#1843: I dare you, try to pass a whole living pig. Just gimme one sec, going for popcorn
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: thats fair you should be able to choose your flavour of pig 😄
 CALSYTHE#6648: we know that this game exists.  there are millions of ways to make games involving rolling animals
 Viola_Buddy#6763: But that's pig *figurines*. You aren't getting that raw pigness
 Minus#1843: so... whole pig plot thickens it seems. What have I done to this chat here 😱
 CALSYTHE#6648: ha, nice
 Viola_Buddy#6763: The origins of dice is rolling knucklebones of animals. Pig dice isn't so far-fetched, or at least pig bone dice.
 Minus#1843: PIGS: The Game. Have fun for a whole family in dozens of minigames, all around PIGS! (Pig Jam not included, Pig Jam sold separately at your nearest grocery store) .
 39#6748: next day at school i did not know how i did that but i was happy
 39#6748: i once got home drunk at like 1am and i still had IT homework to do and i somehow managed to get it to work (it was some for loop maths puzzle exercise)
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: its already a thing you can do
 Minus#1843: alright then I want pig tetris too.
 CALSYTHE#6648: rolling farm animals would be funny
 Lukey#6052: literally what I was going to say lmao
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: like a digital version of pass the pigs?
 graygray#8956: Isn't that already a big board game?
 CALSYTHE#6648: someone should make a game about rolling pigs like dice
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: fantastic
 Murten#0001: Search for messages then mention you.
 39#6748: good 😄
 Minus#1843: think about it, lard with greaves is basically jam made of pig '-'
 graygray#8956: It wasn't my original plan, I didnt end up in Popworld so my night is going better than I expected
 The Dream#2457: Gotta hit that Ballmer Peak
 CALSYTHE#6648: jam rations... scary times
 CALSYTHE#6648: pig jam
 39#6748: obviously it doesnt work if you get actually drunk 💀
 Minus#1843: ya want strawberry, cherry or maybe pig jam?
 Cearáj#9556: i hate cold, it's winter in south hemisphere
 sendhelpidfk#6700: nope, rationed to only a tablespoon per person
 graygray#8956: Got the dice rolling actually working 🤣 . For those who say alcohol works with gamedev, they're mostly wrong
 Evan Butterfield#7312: It's a thing here to cook random stuff on the sidewalk
 Minus#1843: I could cook my dinner on street with that heat! xD
 Cearáj#9556: damn I wish
 CALSYTHE#6648: is there enough jam??
 budget#0365: Nah it had to have been within 60 messages
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: it could be been done ages ago or it could have been deleted
 Amelia-chan#4996: oh boy how I love programming at 1:38 am
 Evan Butterfield#7312: A little toasty there? It's starting to cool down and it's 112°f or 45°c
 Minus#1843: well remember that whole idea of seasons is up, for Poland it is middle of summer now, so.... yeah, and different regions are also going to get different temps due to winds etc
 budget#0365: Did someone ping me, I got a notification but see no message
 Wames#8409: Not in the US. Michigan has been pretty mild lately.
 Minus#1843: in general, GUYS, **hydrate** especially if you're in europe cause here it is getting a little bit toasty as for our standards
 39#6748: reminds me of minecraft lucky block mod lol
 The Dream#2457: Incredibly not stupid idea, I love this. Might get repetitive a little fast tho, would need some extra layers
 Minus#1843: just got stupid idea, minecraft clone, but every block you dig is a dice roll what you get, pleasant or not surprises included :V
 The Dream#2457: same it's the feeling of when you don't get enough/anything done in the day so you stay up trying to be productive through the night... which leads to the same issue again in the morning
Maybe it's better to be nocturnal 🤔
 39#6748: covid aint that bad for me tbh, its the 2nd time that i have it now and what should i say, besides the little headache im feeling fine and can dev like a pro (god bless github copilot)
 Minus#1843: Not sure about covid but I often have nose bleeds, for me it is just "alright if I cannot stop it in 15 minutes, let's call ambulance"
 Cearáj#9556: I sleep like a stone as well, my problem is bedtime procrastination
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I shouldn't have to say this but do NOT put a game jam above your health
 39#6748: thanks
 Wames#8409: hope you get better bro
 The Dream#2457: g'nighto gl
 Scolon#4218: You're devving with covid? 💀
 39#6748: nah im fine now. not the first time stuff like that happening, also i have covid so yeah probably thats why
 Wames#8409: Sleepless nights are sometimes part of the game jam experience
 Minus#1843: Everything fine now? If not seek medical help immediately if you cannot stop it. You can be in serious danger.
 The Dream#2457: can't help it I'm hard addicted to sleep 😔
 Cearáj#9556: gn
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: maybe stop posting and go get medical help
 Cearáj#9556: that's some hardcore shit ngl
 who-is-Ellie#8917: alright time for 6h of sleep, see y'all tomorrow! ^^
 Minus#1843: we're going with idea of: let's make this game work at all, maybe you guys are going to like it, maybe not, we don't care about that, we want to make a game, test our abilities and have fun 😛
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: wait, just now?
 39#6748: this game jam is tryna kill me, just almost passed out because my nose started bleeding like a period
 The Dream#2457: the OP strat- just being healthy about sleep
 Cearáj#9556: didn't sleep enough last night so that's probably affecting me as well
 Cearáj#9556: same, but I'm considering doing something different and actually going to sleep early since my brain is probably much cleaner when well rested in the morning
 Corrade#0901: penis
 The Dream#2457: thanks for lookin out for us mods
~~but it is really tempting tho~~
 sqrt#9237: sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak
And when you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up
But you got to search within you, and try to find that inner strength
And just pull that shit out of you
And get that motivation to not give up, and not be a quitter
No matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse
 Mattstov(Matt) ⃤#8596: same thing for me
 Scolon#4218: I don't have any art outside of a few icons, just a bunch of placeholder textures and mechanics
So the game is a bit lifeless atm, that'll just soon though
 Minus#1843: Lemme introduce Howling Badgers team: Me, me as a temp game designer, and me as a temp 3d artists, cause they're sleeping :V
 TheGameShePlays#7762: I believe there's a law where I am that says your signature isn't legally binding on a contract after being awake for 3 days because you're so out of it.
I remember when I was younger they did a TV experiment and people tried to stay awake for a week... I must find out how that went, I forget.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: please get decent rest, don't crunch your way through the jam it won't help
 who-is-Ellie#8917: also to finish a game jam actually lol, albeit in a slightly different style to this (6 teams of 5, working in-person sponsored by some 'big' game companies)
 Astrow#4496: I guess that's true I am working alone
 The Dream#2457: Haven't gotten to start yet and really considering powering through the night with coffee at this point
 who-is-Ellie#8917: i've done 3 days max
 Mattstov(Matt) ⃤#8596: alot of people are working in massive teams
 Ice ZeeKay#7335: Ohh aaaaa I see scary, yea I think most I’ve done is all nighters and I feel p bad even with just that
 Minus#1843: ya didn't hear? After 3 days without sleep it is possible to hallucinate, after 4-5 days you have very high chance of heart attack, that's why I'm not going to do that again EVER
 Ice ZeeKay#7335: Wai wut dragon xd
 Minus#1843: hahahah, I get you, I was confused by that dragon behind me after 72 hours, but got used to it, sadly it went somewhere after I slept.
 Astrow#4496: I've realized how efficient yall are. I haven't got animations for my character and I stole the assets (not litteraly don't kill me mods) and I am using brackeys character controller but some of yall are working on making an inventory
 Ice ZeeKay#7335: Damn I see. Once I pulled an all nighter for a project, couldnt stay up or focused so chugged some coffee, then I had my first panic attack lol (I think it was also cuz of the stress)
 Cearáj#9556: the possibilities are endless! (literally)
 who-is-Ellie#8917: uhh, any idea why my UI isn't showing up in a built? lol
 (유)니티 좋음/나찰 니티#7281: Kay
 Minus#1843: 🤔 InffiniDice
 Cearáj#9556: ok guys hear me out, what if
ball dice
 Ahat#0842: ill continue my game though, and ill do this jam next year
 KimTheMightyChim#0685: "I will focus on the basic game stuff first" I say, while animating strands of hair individually
 Minus#1843: it's simple just study at university and have like half of semester suddenly pile up in few days in terms of rapports, werid exams etc
I was driving till 48 hours without sleep, after that it was safer to take a bus. after I finished everything it was just "crash into bed, wake up after 20 hours :V
 Astrow#4496: Health < GAMING GAME JAMS YEAAAAAAAH 😎
 Ahat#0842: im gonna leave the jam, just dont have the time,
 TheGameShePlays#7762: "I will focus on the basic game stuff first" I say, opening the animator controller to make the precise sequence of something in the background
 Ice ZeeKay#7335: I can’t do anything or think the day of an all-nighters let alone 90 hrs omg how do u do that
 Viola_Buddy#6763: Lots of dice aren't 6-sided. Even 6-sided dice can be loaded dice, so they might not give a perfect 1-in-6 chance, either.
 GODFATHER#6766: Alright message me personally
 Technically Insane#9013: hows yalls progress
 Minus#1843: either no sleep for few days or sleeping for one whole day. both options are possible, both options are kinda bad 🤔
 DemonPawi97#7055: Doesn’t matter it doesn’t even have to be numerical values xd you’re free in the way your dice are implemented
 Astrow#4496: Wtf is your sleep schedule going to be like after the Jam
 Astrow#4496: I have no team 🗿 I would be dragging them down anyways, I'm just following a tutorial for my game
 Minus#1843: trust me, I made some bad choices in life already, never again I'm going 90 hours without sleeping, NEVER
 39#6748: you can decide
 Freast#9278: wait, does dice roll specifically mean 1 in 6 chance, or just random
 Clive Dev#0446: its going pretty good actually
 (유)니티 좋음/나찰 니티#7281: I'm working alone
 DemonPawi97#7055: 2 am gang where ya at! 🤣 but still I need to go to work tomorrow. See yall laterss. I might not be joining this jam but am pretty excited to what ya’ll be making. BEST OF LUCK!!! 🔥🔥🔥
 Astrow#4496: If you want to be productive for the last full day of the jam you should get some rest
 GODFATHER#6766: Are u working alone?
Or is there more people in ue team
 39#6748: omg i dont know about you guys but github copilot is saving my ass and brain... it fills stuff like ```self.x, self.y = (pg.mouse.get_pos()[0] - self.TILE_WIDTH/2), (pg.mouse.get_pos()[1] - (self.TILE_NUM * (self.TILE_HEIGHT/2 + (7//3))))``` in one second while i would probably spend at least minutes
 Clive Dev#0446: yup
 Minus#1843: sounds like epic team of random randomness which can lead only to chaos.
 (유)니티 좋음/나찰 니티#7281: I put you on the team
 who-is-Ellie#8917: isn't it like 10pm at latest in america?
 Astrow#4496: Oh so you're up bright and early
 Clive Dev#0446: 1 european and 2 americans, im asian xP
 GODFATHER#6766: Ok sure if you put me in team, I can help you...
 Minus#1843: hey I'm from Europe here, sleep is for weak! Or something like that '-'
 who-is-Ellie#8917: also from europe!
 DemonPawi97#7055: Im here lol 🤣
 (유)니티 좋음/나찰 니티#7281: Um no but I have the dungeon generation and player movement,and minimap
 Astrow#4496: Europe teammates? there are a lot of European game devs
 Minus#1843: might be not finished, but hey, testing builds, we still kinda do that stuff 😂
 wren#0640: tbh the dice *is* what looks like a d6 but with 8 sides lol so this makes sense
 Clive Dev#0446: my teammates are asleep, timezones suck xP
 Astrow#4496: They said you could take it anyway so I took it the easy way 💀
 GODFATHER#6766: Is your game already finished
 Astrow#4496: I'm kind of phoning it in for the theme I don't know rng or pixel art so I just put dice pixel art on a unity asset and that's it for the theme lol
 wren#0640: hm i tried making my dice accurate rather than just increasing til the max every movement and i think that just made its movement really confusing? so im gonna go back to physically impossible dice lol
 Minus#1843: **it depends**, just go with the flow, that's my idea how jams are supposed to be taken
 sendhelpidfk#6700: considering i'm nowhere close to mvp whatsoever, or even anything more than a backend test
 sendhelpidfk#6700: how terrible of an idea is it to let myself get sidetracked and write music
 Minus#1843: that's why you're just reminding people to switch channels if something like that happens, and people should just get there and everything will be alright... And with that I think it is now another 45-50 minutes of coding, need to make some more stuff before potentially crashing into bed
 (유)니티 좋음/나찰 니티#7281: Can you test my game and give some feedback?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Its ok it happens, we just don't want it to drown out the chatting
 ATaco#6690: My B.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: take the code stuff to  thanks
 Cearáj#9556: or, change the Align property from Left to Center (if it's a regular label and not a RichTextLabel)
 ATaco#6690: `transform.Position = transform.Position + transform.Rotation * Vector3.Forward * Time.DeltaTime`?
 TheRayvenn#0001: It points towards the mouse but when I move it towards the mouse it just breaks
 SlingingPlant145#5532: Game jams in a nutshell
 DemonPawi97#7055: Search brackeys touch countrols he did something similar to that in that video
 ATaco#6690: With code? Use `transform.Rotation = Quaternion.LookAt( /* Get the mouse Pos*/ - /*Get my pos*/)`
 Minus#1843: my current state:
- GD went sleeping so I try to figure out how it is all supposed to work
- 3d artist made some mistakes so I am going through tons of blender tutorials so I can just test stuff before I can tell what I need fixed
- my controllers and managers decided to crap out and everything is in chaos mode
BUT at least character is following waypoints. Way to go xD
 Arleycht#7791: try setting the text label as the child to the thing you want it centered in, and the layout anchors of the label to full rect, or v/h wide
 TheRayvenn#0001: Unity hates me. Does anybody know how to point a game object towards the mouse and then move it towards the mouse?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: thats awesome
 ATaco#6690: Sort of sad there's no Voice Channel here. I'd love to Vibe and Stream concepts.
 TheGameShePlays#7762: building out the scenes with these assets has given me great ideas for fleshing out one of my other plans after the jam
 ATaco#6690: "How quickly can I flesh out an Inventory System" and other horrible questions I need to ask myself.
 Astrow#4496: Is this good progress for one day? Think up my idea, create *cough cough* modify existing assets from the unity asset store for my needs, yoink brackeys character controller and set up basic character movement.
 Lukey#6052: Still haven't finished the most *basic* of polishing on the main features but yet my monkey brain decided to start making another random side feature B)
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: for sure go get some rest and you can always fight with the UI again toward the end of the time limit
 DemonPawi97#7055: 2 am here lol
 SlingingPlant145#5532: I'm in a similar state. We created a GDD, so I have a general idea what they want for some parts of the game, but Idk for others. :/
 ATaco#6690: It's 10 AM 😂
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Oh yeah! I just need to come up with a ton more tasks for the programmers. They're already chugging along the prototype and we're running things for them to do. Lol.
 DemonPawi97#7055: I feel ya or maybe u can create a duel game and then u can have dices that gives u extra stats or disadvantages
For example if u have a character that attacks with a power of 10 u have the chance to roll a die to increase the damage but the die can also have an outcome that can decrease you’re armor
 kablouser#4232: Good night, everyone! Sweet dreams coming.
 Minus#1843: Ughh then cannot really help, sorry 😅
 Cearáj#9556: 2 clicks, if you're using a normal label just change the align property which is right under the text property
 who-is-Ellie#8917: Godot
 Minus#1843: In what engine you're trying to center it?
 ATaco#6690: Game Design, where possible, should be delegated IMO. Anyone can think of an idea, not anyone can design a good mechanic.
 Minus#1843: for me it is more: It is great when main Game Designer went sleeping and I am now left with note scraps with vague explanation what I need to have done for tomorrow. Programmer designing a whole game mechanic is not a good idea xD
 nekotheasparagus#0809: Sleep first is rule
 ATaco#6690: I generally avoid art entirely, as a Programmer first and foremost.
 who-is-Ellie#8917: y'know what, does anyone really care if the text is centered or on the left of the screen? xD I can spend the next 3h sleeping or centering text and I think i know which one i'm picking lol
 Tex B.#4484: who else chose an art heavy idea despite being bad at art?
 Cearáj#9556: same bruv
 DemonPawi97#7055: If u use github make sure u use the correct .gitignore template so u won’t add shit stuff in it…brackeys made a good vid about it
 The Pullenator#1864: me rolling basically solo be like
 Lukey#6052: gahdamnit! I've unknowingly come back and started procrastinating again >:|
 ATaco#6690: Bruh this theme got me *thinkin*
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: you're happy you took on the numbers then, still feeling good 🙂
 SlingingPlant145#5532: It feels great when everyone else on the team is in a different time zone and won't be awake for another couple hours. 🥲
 Zag#6205: No they are too limited in file size
 Cearáj#9556: I feel like I can't quite figure out a game based on random dice rolls that would feel fair to me as a player while still actually using the dice
 budget#0365: Probably github
 Apollonios#9210: anyone know the best way to share unity files between two team members? is dropbox/github the answer?
 MikeHazeJr#6582: How is everyone doing? I managed to get a great roll mechanic, still mentally working on the related gameplay
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: hows the team plugging along
 budget#0365: I think it goes a bit fast
It's hard to see what the damage is with that frequency/at close range
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I'm glad its not just me then lol. It's all anchors and margins
 Jellogramming#4653: the number on them is the damage done to the enemy
 who-is-Ellie#8917: UE is totally different with UObjects, AActors and SWidgets, which is what really confuses me whenever I work in godot or unity
 budget#0365: Are the shooting dice cosmetic or do they have a mechanical function
 Cearáj#9556: 43 left
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: were already 7 hours into the jam lol
 who-is-Ellie#8917: I wouldn't discount yourself haha, from my limited experience in both unity and godot seem to have a very similar 'gameobject' style ECS
 Jellogramming#4653: I posted a video of my game in  if anyone wants to check it out
 DemonPawi97#7055: Well in case I don’t join I might share an idea. What about a platform game based on luck. Where the character’s action are decided by certain amount given by the dice. For example a u start with 2 dice. And the summed value of the dice can be used to move, jump, attack. Like move costs 1, jump costs 2 and attack costs 3
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I feel like the UI in godot is the same as the UI in unity- admittedly I haven't used Unity for a while but when I first jumped to godot I remember feeling like I understood how it all worked because it was so similar.
That might just be my weird brain though lol
 Cearáj#9556: it's powerful tho
 Arleycht#7791: godot ui is... interesting
 39#6748: trust me, at that point just remake it in another engine, god i hate ui in godot
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Well, I was going to live stream progress... It went up in flames really quickly...
 budget#0365: I might have more knowledge of Game Design than any other human alive or dead, no way to say for sure though
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: thats a whole thing... the nodes are sizes and positioned based on the min size, anchors and then parent's size and margins. You might find joining the godot disocrd good her help but if you need anything more specific take it to 
 Cearáj#9556: lol I'm still thinking about an idea and procrastinating here, gl to you too if you join
 GODFATHER#6766: sorry that my skills are not any impressive
 Darklava#1088: 100%
 Wames#8409: UI is the worstttttttttttttt
 GODFATHER#6766: I have knowledge about Game Designing and I can do testing too
 Cearáj#9556: I usually hate doing UI but I guess I understand it, what you trynna do exactly?
 DemonPawi97#7055: Hello all. I wish you all the very best in this game jam! 🤟🏻🔥 I don’t know if I’ll join might check it tomorrow 🤣
 Cearáj#9556: uhhh control nodes blablabla
 who-is-Ellie#8917: I have no idea how UI works in godot lol helpp
 budget#0365: I thank you for your thanks soldier
 SoupScythe#8178: I thank you for your input
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: 10 years or so? ish
 Scolon#4218: I'm currently thinking of overall theme for my game
Like, locations, enemies, player design, etc
So I'm chilling here for a bit
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: that's fantatstic
 Zag#6205: How long have you been making games? Just wondering
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Take a breath, take a break. Get up and stretch and work out what you're trying to do before you get back to it
 Jellogramming#4653: this is the first game jam that I don't think I'm overscoping on
 budget#0365: Eating crumbly food then touching game pieces?
 Lukey#6052: `- Help Complete -`
 VulpineMachine#2173: [Feeling Relief...]
 Lukey#6052: [Sending Help...]
 SoupScythe#8178: I need some examples bad tabletop game etiquette
 Zag#6205: Same lol
 VulpineMachine#2173: What am I doing!? Why did I think I could do this!? ... *** SEND HELP ***
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I can mute you if it helps 😛 haha
 39#6748: that's so easy to modify, its even funny.. all you need to do is run the main loop async and add one line of code in the main loop
 Jellogramming#4653: same
 Lukey#6052: true
 who-is-Ellie#8917: running in browser is so important for jams imo, it's why i'm not using unreal lol, nobody wants to download a 3gb file for a jam lol
 budget#0365: Man your code is gonna be easy to modify but this is harrowing to me
 Scolon#4218: Gonna dev for about 3-4 more hours and call it a day
 Lukey#6052: i should probably work on my game instead of procrastinating by staring at this discord channel
 Zag#6205: K
 39#6748: im using python with pygame rn and that only because yesterday i found out that theres finally a way to run it in the browser with wasm
 who-is-Ellie#8917: build an executable, yea
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yeah I wasn't replaying to anyone specific I was just commenting a head's up to people. It happens all the time. If I was warning you about something I'd pinging you and tell you ok 🙂
 39#6748: or not compile, you know what i mean, make an exe
 Michel#2879: oh yeah GJC
 39#6748: huh you can compile it tho
 Michel#2879: I tried it once upon a time. it didn't work
 budget#0365: Everyone knows the best game engine is to use the the node4j minecraft exploit to run msdos emulation on a 2 gigabyte raspberrypi
 MrBen#0001: cya now
 Zag#6205: Nothing made me think that. Proving my point, you legit just deleted your post nvm lol my phone glitched 😂😔💀💀
 who-is-Ellie#8917: i guess you could pull a mojang and bundle your own JVM with the project?
 MrBen#0001: oof
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: What makes you think my post was aimed at you?
 Veqsa#8120: Thanks
 Michel#2879: actually Java is against the rules. cus it requires you to download additional software aka. Java's virtual machine
 Lukey#6052: because link is great
 Zag#6205: Yes
 WorkingJoe#4433: I don't have any connection to this link Fella
 budget#0365: Why is every emote in this server a variation of link
 GameDude#3494: Ah, nothing like the good old brute forcing all code and skipping all logic to save time and move on to another feature
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I said stop ben, so stop
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yeah this sort of joke isn't funny as a reply to what I just said
 MrBen#0001: ok 
 Michel#2879: life was better when I was just chilling and making programming memes
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: go to sleep then, that doesn't require pinging me
 Zag#6205: I understand people have different likes and desires in what they like to use, I was simply commenting on another comment about choice of game engine. No hate was placed into the wording of my response.
 39#6748: only when someone uses java its ok
 Darklava#1088:  That image you posted of your games looks great! I would definitely love to play it when it's done
 gnarbro#1627: Thank you!
 graygray#8956: Save that time, player controllers take for ever to make smooth
 Jellogramming#4653: yes, you can use anything you have the legal rights to
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: no thanks
 Scolon#4218: seems like there's a lot of rumor and misinformation spreading about the Unity merge
 MrBen#0001: yep
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I'm not offended, I'm moderating the chat. I'm making sure things don't become an argument
 gnarbro#1627: Hey everyone, this is my first game jam. I'm using Unity and I know we are allowed to re-use code/sprites that we've made before, but what about Prefabs? Can I bring over my character/character controller from another project? Thank you!
 Zag#6205: I really don’t think you need to be so offended by it
 budget#0365: Business mergers typically have very little immediate impact on the software platforms they control
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Also lets not shit-talk what engines people are using. Different people have different workflows and are suited to different tools. Saying stuff like "X engine is rubbish" isn't helpful for conversation. A debate about why YOU don't like something isn't the same as saying it's unlikable
 who-is-Ellie#8917: Well they merged with ironSource (I think that's what they're called?) and they make malware lol
 Zag#6205: Probably cause I haven’t made a 2 d game before
 davidnjihiahere#6326: I like how this question turned into a roast session
 Ricky#5210: Man I wish UE was viable for 2D games in any practical way lol
 budget#0365: How do you mean, Unity is a good game engine
 skonn dinasir#9002: yeah just look up aseprite source code on google
and if u wanna compile it look up a tutorial
 Zag#6205: Unity > unreal, Godot is tied with Unity
 krepen#6466: are there diversifiers in this jam?
 who-is-Ellie#8917: lmao it's just a framework for malware now tho isnt it?
 notpenguin#8983: wdym is the source code available somewhere?
 budget#0365: Unity is based and I will hear no dissent
 Jellogramming#4653: unreal engine just isn't unity
 who-is-Ellie#8917: if you get a friend to buy it on itch you get drm-free installer files for all platforms lol
 skonn dinasir#9002: no i compiled it
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: take the tech questions to 
 davidnjihiahere#6326: tic80. No editor. No art program
 budget#0365: A TI-84 graphing calculator design suite
 Scolon#4218: I compiled aseprite myself
 who-is-Ellie#8917: one thing that annoys me is that i have my IDE in my editor ugh lol
 notpenguin#8983: damn yall paid for aseprite? im too poor :(
 graygray#8956: Unity and VS
 skonn dinasir#9002: oh ok thanks idk how i forgot that lol
 Ricky#5210: Using UE as it's the only tool I'm competent in lol
 Scolon#4218: I'm using Unity, Visual Studio and Aseprite
 MrRoboman#9804: Haha true. Tho, my heart is with godot
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: I do not advise using UE for a game jam !
 who-is-Ellie#8917: godot, for better or worse .-.
 Jellogramming#4653: unity
 wren#0640: asesprite and godot
 notpenguin#8983: hey whats everyone using to make their game? cause i feel like i've made a mistake with the tech im using
 MrBen#0001: getUnrealEngine().Cool()
Return;
 Scolon#4218: I'm doing pixel art too yeah. I'm doing the most of my art tomorrow though
 Jellogramming#4653: void Function(){}
and to call it it's Function;
 MrRoboman#9804: GetComponent().Method()
 BLOKE#8078: i think mrroboman said it
 budget#0365: My personal strategy is to have a level of technical knowledge just high enough to baselessly critique the programming of others while not actually doing anything myself
 MrBen#0001: jokes on u
 who-is-Ellie#8917: Like what even is this UI editor 😭 how tf do I change the text size lmaoo
 skonn dinasir#9002: ik but how do i call it in code
 39#6748: next tima ima use asm
 budget#0365: Because your suffering will not end until the powers that be are sated
 who-is-Ellie#8917: no cuz I don't know godot 😭 😭  (it is an awesome engine, I know!)
 MrRoboman#9804: You have to GetComponent()
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: godots so cool. you do need some time to get used to it
 BLOKE#8078: public void
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: because godot is awesome?
 skonn dinasir#9002: how do i call a function in unity again, i forgot somehow lol
 who-is-Ellie#8917: Gah why did I choose to do this in godot 😭
 GameDevDave#7551: Goodluck everyone
 CFHM#9742: ha yep. My b. Replying to you to follow the conversation, but I was saying it for everyone. Thanks 🙂
 MrBen#0001: thx :D
 Jellogramming#4653: looks great so far
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I'm aware of that but it's still worth mentioning so people have all the information. Eg just saying "you can make a game that doesn't fit the theme" leaves out some stuff. The fact your game will be effectively disqualified is worth mentioning
 PizzaGamer#1302: I forgot about the jam too, bye bye 6 hours
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: You can write whatever you want in your game description as long as it doesn't break itch.io ToS. But when you link your game to the jam there will be some information to fill out
 Bombshell93#5069: DAMN! I forgot about the Jam and have a busy weekend,
For anyone looking for ideas I'll throw one out that I would've tried: Super Monkey Ball, but the ball is a D20, and its rolled value is a mechanic
 BLOKE#8078: i got an idea where the player starts with dice to determine certain values for base characteristics and gets a dice roll every round as a multiplier to one of their stats. idk what the actual game should be tho, just how to use the dice
 MrBen#0001: my game gameplay  :) 7 levels
 Jellogramming#4653: I'm like speedrunning even though there's plenty of time left
 WorkingJoe#4433: I had an idea which I would have named "pearmutations", won't go into detail because my current idea is not far off. But if it inspires anyone have fun with it \:))
 PizzaGamer#1302: Oooh nice I didn't know there was a discord server for this
 USER#8646: Thank you so much for guiding me through this
 CFHM#9742: I mean, that makes sense. If Mark is going to make a video featuring games with the theme, he certainly can't show one that doesn't have it. But jamming is more than just "winning". It's about the community and the stuff you can do and learn.
 Thisisareallylongname#6139: r u guys doing pixel art too?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Adherance to theme will absolutely affect your score, that may not be something you are worried about but just to be clear this jam does expect you to use theme.
My advice is that if you have a choice of not finishing a game or finishing a game that doesn't fit will then choose to finish
 Lukey#6052: ok just had a snack break, gonna grab some water. Make sure you guys eat and drink, then I've got a game to dev. (Make sure you guys eat and drink too!)'
 USER#8646: Yeah its definitely difficult to design but should be easy to implement
 WorkingJoe#4433: I had a really punny name for a concept but I switched ideas
 Scolon#4218: I need to restart unity, starting to go slow since I've had it open for so long I think
I got like two more main things to program then I might start on the art
 davidnjihiahere#6326: I forgot puns in games were a thing
 budget#0365: That's why it seems technically immense to me but if you can pull it off in an interesting way could be nifty
 Scolon#4218: Yeah it's only been roughly 6 & and a half hours. There's still plenty time
 nekotheasparagus#0809: I’m hoping my idea is unique enough. Maybe my pun title will get me noticed lol
 sendhelpidfk#6700: something something that one really good mark rosewater gdc talk
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yes but remember the game is discounted from being showcased if it doesn't fit the theme
 Jellogramming#4653: idk why I'm stressing out, it's only the first day
 MrBen#0001: can I like explain my point of view in game decs?
 Scolon#4218: Adherence to theme will affect your ratings in originality I think though
 USER#8646: I like designing complex systems but I'd need to ensure that you can progress no matter what you roll and that you aren't just re-rolling to progress
 sendhelpidfk#6700: just remember that subtlety in how you incorporate it isn't necessary and in some cases might work against you
 CFHM#9742: "Adherence to theme" isn't one of the rating categories. It's just a starting point to get everyone going.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: You can interpret the theme how you want. When you submit your game you will be able to justify how it fits the theme
 MrBen#0001: cool
 sendhelpidfk#6700: you can get creative with interpretations of the jam theme, so yeah
 WorkingJoe#4433: I'm just coping that I can't get my precious data out of my structuredbuffer so now I have to work without computeshaders
 budget#0365: The technical complexity of that sounds immense but it would be neat
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: They mean after the deadline which is why they said that and the question was already answered 🙂
 MrBen#0001: I made a game where the mechanics r unexpectable just like the roll of dice is it OK?
 USER#8646:  what if its as a very open ended puzzle game spread across 12 levels and due to what level yoe visit each time Beeing random you can solve it in many different ways
 sendhelpidfk#6700: one of the more serious ideas i scrapped was an rpg in which the current environment for battles was determined by dice that could be rerolled by you or your opponent
 nekotheasparagus#0809: If you mean before the deadline yes
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: To be clear if you are struggling with the theme and want to make something without worrying about it then you can, just know you ratings will be affected but in this jam there's no winners or prizes so that's not really an issue
 Nathan W#4780: perfect, thank you
 Echoslab#3872: Thank you everyone!
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: you can edit the page's info and the decorative elements you just can't change the files
 WorkingJoe#4433: spent hours trying to get some engine feature to work for the main gameplay mechanic but it just wouldn't budge. No menu for me \:p
 graygray#8956: Any games you've done that you can add some classic dice roll rng to
 sendhelpidfk#6700: idk trying to keep a bunch of dice on the correct face but more and more dice keep getting added
 budget#0365: An rpg where you roll dice to determine a preselected stat and then allocate the excess of whatever the roll is (so if you roll a 1 you have 5 excess) to your other stats
 Danny Dan Dan#6699: Yatzee RPG
 Nathan W#4780: Question, can I still edit the game page AFTER submission
 nekotheasparagus#0809: You don’t have to make a dice roll, but since you’ve already spent the time:
You can make it visualize a randomizer
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: if its your first jam just feel free to ignore the theme
 39#6748: These were my notes at the beginning:
•    Endless runner/high score game
o    Before every round you roll the dice and get the rolled dice amount of power ups/items
•    Black Jack
o    Well black jack just with dice lol
•    Endless runner/high score game
o    You can collect a dice every few meters or something and either get something good or bad
 budget#0365: That's on the right track I think, just ask yourself if your design is taken from the perspective of why it needs to be random
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: not everyone is going to like every theme. You can try and make the best of it or you can let it go but don't be bringing the bad vibes round when people are trying to get into it and work hard
 Echoslab#3872: Someone I need help getting a idea. Please, give me something good or bad, idc. I need something. I spent forever just getting a dice to roll. And have no idea what to do with it. It's my first game jam. PLEASE!
 sendhelpidfk#6700: F
 Squirtz MD#2049: well lost most of my meaningfull progress RIP
 wren#0640: it always goes up to its max value before resetting regardless of the side you roll it from
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: there are game jams where you make templates on paper or card/board games etc. There's game jams for everything
 budget#0365: I am taking this as a personal challenge to rob the world of more positivity
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: for a longer time jam, absolutely. in two days it's over kill imo
 nekotheasparagus#0809: How so?
 wren#0640: i JUST realised the dice in my game doesnt function like a real life dice lmao
 sqrt#9237: ass theme
 budget#0365: Well played, or that's what I would say if I wasn't typing this message out on a mechanical differential analyzer used by Ada Lovelace herself. Pace yourself next time kid
 nekotheasparagus#0809: Can confirm - had a class for my game dev degree where we made games in only paper
 USER#8646: So maybe have some things change depending on the order you played the levels.Like what if there are some levers that can open doors in other levels
 MrBen#0001: 🤔
 Echoslab#3872: guys
 graygray#8956: Sorry your punch card failed, try again next week
 budget#0365: This is unironically a good design exercise imo
 sendhelpidfk#6700: to be fair i do benchmark on my old sandy bridge laptop for performance with game jams
 who-is-Ellie#8917: vacuum tubes? I'm still cracking enigma on the original turing machine
 budget#0365: Look at mr moneybags over here, fancy schmancy Apple 2 while I'm running on vacuum tubes
 sendhelpidfk#6700: just remember: it's not stupid if it works
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: really you should just make your games in paper for a game jam
 who-is-Ellie#8917: you really should be benchmarking on an Apple II, that way you make sure everyone can run your game
 nekotheasparagus#0809: If you’re not coding your game in machine language don’t even bother /j
 Danny Dan Dan#6699: The scenario this time was realizing I don't need to come up with a way to render a custom mesh of a randomized dice, and instead just slap 6 planes together and call it a day lol
 budget#0365: If you can't run your code on a set of stones in the middle of the desert did you really even program it
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: we all know that during a game jam you should be thinking about memoizing your code
 39#6748: thats how im going through school lol
 davidnjihiahere#6326: I'm really interested with the puzzle games that will come out from this jam
 budget#0365: I am the gremlin in your brain demanding you optimize your for loop to complete in O(logn) time
 wzyanggg#5277: The theme is really diffucult for me...
 nekotheasparagus#0809: Gamejams in a nutshell
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: how do you have already seven levels. What?
 Danny Dan Dan#6699: I'm gradually learning that I have to stop worrying about making everything optimized and efficient, and just go with the "good enough" solution
 MrBen#0001: I will post 7 lvl gameplay in  soon 😜
 nekotheasparagus#0809: I mean a little but do whatever you want
 budget#0365: This is just my opinion but I think if you just have levels happen randomly that's not really using the theme in an interesting way. That's just having a game that could've been linear which you've decided to scramble arbitrarily. I think to make that meaningfully engaging you need some intersection in what you're doing or have done
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: guys. switch/match statements. use em
 Among us#2308: a dress up game where you roll the die to decide what type of clothing you get to use
 MrBen#0001: ok I need to take a break
 ddd Makbema#7469: is it to crazy to have a die possesed by a ghost?
 who-is-Ellie#8917: gamedev be like
 Jellogramming#4653: same
 nekotheasparagus#0809: The rules don’t say you have to make a game.
You can make a dress up game where you dress up a die for his evening at the casino
 golds#3845: I have a bunch of if statements lmao
 budget#0365: How dare you give this a positive spin. I was trying to fulfill my goal of destroying as many positive things as possible
 USER#8646: So you mean having power ups and such carry over from each level
 Galse#8611: I planned out my times with 9/10 hours of sleep each day and 30-1h of time for eating + showers every day. Y'll killing yourself out there w/ this jam jeez
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: There was some times about people dropping out earlier etc. Just a reminder that if you have trouble with the theme or if you don't get as far as you want then you can absolutely make something that doesn't fit the theme, it just won't do so well in the ratings but of that's not your goal anyway then it's irrelevant.
The other thing you can do is decide to not make a game and instead focus on learning a specific feature from your chosen tools. You have the time of the game jam carved out in your schedule anyway so make the most of it and see how far you get even if you don't pursue finishing a game.
This jam is all about learning and embracing the challenge and there are many way to do that
 sendhelpidfk#6700: didn't start until like 2 and a half hours ago and so far all i've done is cobble together all my backend stuff
 Lukey#6052: the GMTK Game Jam always has the BEST themes
 Borna#7759: gonna rest for ~7 hour
 budget#0365: It's probably the best I've seen in general honestly
 39#6748: me who hasnt stopped working on it since the beginning and is dying because of headaches and covid
 Among us#2308: if I think of an interesting idea for one, I'm definitely doing it
 Jellogramming#4653: I like the theme. It's vague enough to where you can come up with many creative ideas, but specific enough that you get ideas out of it.
 Galse#8611: I like how on the announcement there is a "REMEMBER TO STAY HYDRATED/FED/WELL RESTED!" reminder lol
 budget#0365: Just like me.....
 39#6748: lmao what
 Among us#2308: so tempted to use a spherical, 1 sided die
 budget#0365: You could do that, but I'd try to make there some compelling purpose behind having that particular implementation in how it intersects with the gameplay. You could for instance have some parts of it carry over from level to level even if the core mechanics differ somewhat
 USER#8646: That way each roll is exiting since its a different mini game
 davidnjihiahere#6326: this theme reminds me a gmtk winning game where you had to predict random movements
 budget#0365: They are much more in line with procedural mathematical languages
 USER#8646:  ok thanks I think in order to keep it simple I might make each level correspond to a mini game that each has a different gameplay but they should be simple enough to not take too much time
 budget#0365: To get very mildly serious here programming languages differ from spoken and written languages in several important ways. In the first place they're constructed and controlled usually through some centralized or distributed apparatus which decides what is and isn't valid. It's very hard to evolve their use beyond the tenants they've already been established to have in a way that is not true of archetypical languages
 39#6748: sounds interesting ngl
 Darklava#1088: Oh nice! yeah you could make some really interesting levels with that
 GiugiX#1016: ahaha
 davidnjihiahere#6326: living the dream
 39#6748: guys whatever you do, dont add drag and drop grid based tetris like stuff, you will save yourself from awful headaches
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Programming languages are languages. They are a set of words and rules used to communicate
 budget#0365: The way I go about it is that I simply don't have bad ideas
 davidnjihiahere#6326: the way I think about it is if an idea sounds good but it won't work, I put it aside and write it down somewhere so I can have it for a future project. If it's good and I can use it, I use it
 Darklava#1088: Hmm, what if when you roll the dice, like your jump height / movement speed is randomized
 GiugiX#1016: but i dont know about how inseret the rolling in the game
 budget#0365: Keep in mind what designs add complication and which don't, certain ideas that on the surface seem complex can often be more simplistic to implement if you're already designing around a core tenant. The easiest thing to do via programming is a calculation or series of steps so if you already have the premise and core code developed it's not that bad sometimes. Though if you're making full on different mechanics it can be
 Reptilian135#9436: same
 jack fractal#5340: What about rolling the dice right onto the screen, and where they land they create platforms?
 wren#0640: ? gdscript is a language ?
 bobjrgeorge#6625: cool
 GiugiX#1016: i create an rpg
 MrBen#0001: my idea is simple:
Platformer game where when u press R to make some unexpected and random  mechanic that helps you reach end of the level
 GiugiX#1016: Guys, i write in GDscript. Is not a fucking language!
 budget#0365: Undertale is just goated in general
 Seva Khusid#8784: So how's it going?
 who-is-Ellie#8917: Oh i'm not saying ideas don't matter, i'm saying that they're cheap. Everyone has ideas, and most ideas have the potential to be good enough, if not great. You can have a game with a mediocre idea but a great core loop, and it'll be fun to play, and you can have a great idea with very poor execution that sucks to play. Execution is more important (and far, far more expensive) than an idea
 Lunar#4998: i'll take undertale as an example, the game is visually very simple,  but gosh the ideas, the characters, the story, it really brings the game to life
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: I'm gonna start my project here soon, and I'll go live when I start it!! Link is in the 
 USER#8646: Its the first game im publishing so  im not sure if i have time for something that complicated
 39#6748: im happy that my only problem is to get it work
 budget#0365: I'm not sure it's physically possible to write python as bad as the worst C, I genuinely just don't think it has that capability
 ryan123#4605: i’m so mad i probabaly won’t be able to work on my game today or tomorrow
 Ahat#0842: time to get started on my game itself
 GiugiX#1016: ahahahahah
 budget#0365: Once again the idea guys are out here winning
 Darklava#1088: Randomness seems like in a way it could be harder to do, because for a lot of ideas you would need to create extra content. And for other games, balancing things so that the randomness still leaves a balanced game can be hard as well
 who-is-Ellie#8917: python is the king of spaghetti code
 Lunar#4998: but if the ideas aren't good, you can have extremely good designs like graphics, the game wouldn't be enjoyable (imo)
 budget#0365: You could for instance have each die correspond to a power **or** a stat depending on what they want to take from it, or some risky modification of a power or stat depending on how they roll. Giving a player the ability to choose this for themselves can create a lot of engagement in that particular context
 39#6748: nah pygame LMAO
 wren#0640: my code probably isnt great but i think its decently readable still?
 who-is-Ellie#8917: not a bad idea, it makes me think of something like xcom, say you roll a dice and you always hit the Xth shot, idk
 GiugiX#1016: im itaian
 davidnjihiahere#6326: actually good design can come from ideas
 39#6748: god damn not even a day has passed and my code looks so spaghetti you could think im italian
 budget#0365: I think if you're going in this direction you should give the player some control over how the randomness is implemented
 jack fractal#5340: A game that appeared to have randomness, and then it turned out to be entirely scripted might be an interesting if frustrating experience.
 MrRoboman#9804: I'm just testing out different ideas, and they're all boring! 😄
 wren#0640: actually i slightly randomised the pitch of the movement sound so it doesnt get annoying but i dont think that *quite* counts
 GiugiX#1016: god i have no idea
 MrBen#0001: omg I feel so tired rn
 budget#0365: I am calculating all randomness in my brain and then playing the game normally with the values I come up with
 USER#8646:  hmm so for a platformer what if instead of random level selection you got two      random power ups that each corresponds to a face in the dice
 davidnjihiahere#6326: I do understand this. But ideas are sort of important. If you have both a well designed game and a good idea, it's a great combo
 wren#0640: im not using any randomness lol
 jack fractal#5340: Hahahahaha
 who-is-Ellie#8917: lmao
 budget#0365: The fact you even have to ask that shows how behind the idea curve you are
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i had like 7-8 ideas today and took them all to the bin cause of the video on randomness in games by mark. the concept of output random and input random is very useful for this jam
 Tupi#6500: would love to do some kind of simulation stuff based on probabilities
 who-is-Ellie#8917: for the jam or in general a game idea?
 budget#0365: Name one idea right now
 Tupi#6500: well, right now I'm looking for an idea
 Ahat#0842: i might not do the jam, i dunno if i will
 who-is-Ellie#8917: Nah, hate to break it to you, ideas are cheap. If you can *design*, then that's valuable now, but an 'idea guy' is almost useless, everyone has ideas ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 budget#0365: Then let me introduce you to one of the best in the business
 budget#0365: I'm definitely a C++ fan so I get that
 Hobusu#5033: As far as I know it should, so long as any updates you push are before the submission deadline!
 davidnjihiahere#6326: I mean idea guys are really important
 PepperTroopa#4091: im kinda stuck with my concept and im feeling a little overwhelmed with how to move forward as far as coding goes..
 who-is-Ellie#8917: yeah for sure xD C++ and BP are really powerful though, and I have a workflow there and plenty of previous code to pull from. In godot i'm starting from scratch, i hate python so gdscript isn't exactly my favorite language, and I have 0 xp in 2d graphics haha, I would've definitely been faster with UE
 graygray#8956: That's my vibe
 budget#0365: I would like to the idea guy who does less work than everyone else but helped design the core tenant so gets most of the credit
 Alphons6#5054: I’d like to join an experienced team, I’m a professional pixel artist, give me a ping
 davidnjihiahere#6326: I feel like this game feels terrible but it's starting to feel nice
 Wolf'1988 🐺⚔#1859: Im loving the theme 😍
 budget#0365: Going Unreal with C++ is a great way to get beautifully realized game assets and mechanics that are 20% complete by the deadline
 Alphons6#5054: hi
 FryDev#0372: same, think I'll just drop out this year
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i think this is going to be a good jam just because i'm actually going to really go all in into learning godot themes
 who-is-Ellie#8917: I feel ya I usually work in unreal, writing c++ and working in 3d with a blender-zbrush->substance painter workflow, decided to do godot + 2d pixel art for the jam lol
 graygray#8956: Lost where? any easy wins to get a nice mvp?
 Scolon#4218: Really close to finishing all my core code
 PepperTroopa#4091: im feeling rlly lost... maybe going solo wasn't such a good idea :(
 who-is-Ellie#8917: welp submitted an early build, I really hope that that updates with the updates i push to itch 😅
 wren#0640: it had to happen at some point
 budget#0365: Hell yeah brother that's what we like to see
 wren#0640: woo just hit the first mechanic that didnt work first try
 Ricky#5210: Tying it to level selection won't be as big an issue if level selection isn't tied to difficulty. If you have a Mega Man-esque level system where they're all roughly the same difficulty but there are different ramifications to the order you play the levels (in Mega Man's case, the powers you pick up), then there will be meaning to the randomness without sacrificing a difficulty curve that can be controlled
 budget#0365: Well just make sure it's engaging whatever it is. No sense having something that's technically fair that doesn't get the player motivated or immersed
lmao itch isn't happy with me
 Takago#8059: I don't think there ever was
 NoelJasik#8768: I have that, but my whole game is dice related, and it's not really all that RNG based, i am trying to make it so no matter what you roll, it should be fair
 USER#8646: At least I haven't put too much work into the idea yet all I have is 2 dice that randomly roll
 USER#8646: Hmm ok
 budget#0365: On its face yeah, but I could be convinced by a more specific idea that ties into randomness in level selection. I don't think you should just staple a random number generator selection to your otherwise unrelated platformer though
 NoelJasik#8768: Yeah, but last jam atleast few guys would sit on somewhere like the bruhkeys discord, but rn i can't find anyone
 graygray#8956: As others said, no, just enjoy your weekend. No stress. I've quit loads of times
 Mrinin#2181: yeah but... I think they'd know to tell their team if they were in a team. They are asking if they should tell any of the mods.
 baz_geluk9#9978: solo
 jack fractal#5340: Unless you're on a team, in which case definitely tell your team.
 USER#8646: But do you think that tying it to level selection is bad
 budget#0365: It is a bit rough that there's no communal space here, I get why though it would be an nightmare to moderate
 Mrinin#2181: no, just don't submit
 graygray#8956: In a team? yes, not? not
 NoelJasik#8768: Why i don't see anyone in any VC in not even single game dev discord i am in, i love to spend time in vc during a game jam, and well i don't really have a place to do it rn
 baz_geluk9#9978: Small question:
Do i need to notify someone if i cancel my participation?
 budget#0365: On a more serious note I think a platformer based around dice is entirely feasible, just depends how you implement the randomness. The possibility space you create when you're rolling the dice should be the thing that sparks interest
 graygray#8956: Ahh, the classic "dev is always right" play
 Ahat#0842: i think today im gonna make all the art and stuff, tommorow program
 JesseMartin#7182:  might have some replay issues
 Mrinin#2181: the theme is "roll of the dice" not "roll of the russian roulette chamber"
 The Wandering Shadow#4975: big brain play
 budget#0365: If people say it's frustrating I'll just tell them that they didn't get it and post on forums talking about how no one understands the true vision at play
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: 48 hours to make the game and send it and 2 hours as a grace period in case you need it to upload your thing
 mimmoO#6880: thinking about making a game you can play only once: simply toss a die. if you roll as 6, you win, otherwise you lose. one attempt only
 The Wandering Shadow#4975: i dunno it's hard to think of something good for this theme
 dangertimmy#8239: just got home from work so I haven’t started yet haha
 USER#8646: So you think it could be frustrating?
 davidnjihiahere#6326: I wonder whether there'll be games on lootboxes. Now I feel like making a fake lootbox
 サヨリ(Sayori)#1414: its 50 hours this time
 graygray#8956: It started 6 hours ago, its 48 hours
 サヨリ(Sayori)#1414: 1 day 20 hours
 graygray#8956: I'm doing a platformer, realistically if you can explain it to yourself its close enough
 Mrinin#2181: I'm willing to bet we'll get more dice themed games from this jam than we ever got in the last 50 years of the gaming industry, so, don't try to adhere to theme too hard. (or at all really)
 budget#0365: My idea is this, a platformer where if you roll a 4 or higher you get to play the game and if you roll a 3 or lower you instantly die
 sqrt#9237: how much time is remaining ?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: EVEN if you wanted to adhere to the theme it doesn't mean it has to be about luck, honestly
 USER#8646: So could a platformer with a relatively flat difficulty curve work
 budget#0365: No?
 sqrt#9237: bro jam ended right ?
 graygray#8956: Yeah I was trying to insinuate that. Lite-dice is the new genre 🤣
 budget#0365: Yeah but rolling the dice is a sick theme so adhere to it 😎
 davidnjihiahere#6326: the problem of making longterm projects and getting burned out
 Mrinin#2181: There is no "adherence to theme" criteria this year. I'm sure you can get away with barely having any luck or dice related things in your game.
 hungryroy#0352: ugh, i still have no idea what to do with this theme
 davidnjihiahere#6326: programming a new game feels frustrating again
 ^_^#9116: i sleep now (for real, i have my music box unplugged and everything )
Hope to see some great games tomorrow
Bye
 graygray#8956: The theme is direct but vague tie-ins always succeed when gameplay thrives
 syelan34#3258: I'm sure some are but not many
 Shattered Omega#2221: Are people no longer accepting new team members?
 budget#0365: Fog of war can be very interesting but I think it's important to consider what control a player has within that scope. Interesting gameplay opportunities occur when you're reconciling with that randomness in an engaging way
 LightHouse#2571: Hope y'all enjoy suffering
 Mrinin#2181: Agreed. Why use such predictable factors like wind and gravity to generate random numbers when we have the truly most capable machine in our heads? I
 kcorb#6614: Anyone else doing a casino theme? Feel like it's gonna be overdone but I'm in too deep now
 Among us#2308: wow D3 die are pretty cool too. I just want to use some kind of unconventional dice
 ^_^#9116: They look funny
 graygray#8956: I think if you are doing something using dice directly it would be at least a really nice visual difference
 budget#0365: Dice? How trivial, I simply computed a perfectly random algorithm in my mind when you asked me to conceive of such a thing.
 Among us#2308: no? 👀
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: do you know about d3 dice?
 Mrinin#2181: The physical boundries of dice cease to exist when us englightened geniuses can come up with ideas that transcend the intelligence of humanity.
 ^_^#9116: I like the second idea
 hehe boi#3720: Ok, it is now my beddy byes so wish me the bed bugs won't bite! Bye bye!
 Among us#2308: I'm thinking about using these in my game, for no other reason than they are cool
 EnderShade#0424: I'm stuck deciding between two ideas.
One idea that fits the theme well but it might be too obvious .
In the other idea the player is given unclear information of what is around him  by a similarity percentage and must proceed avoiding dangerous encounters, but I’m afraid people might take it as straying too far from the theme.
 USER#8646: Do you think i should do something to ensure that you can't get hard levels at the beginning and vice versa
 budget#0365: The infinite potential carried within me surpasses the pathetic corporeal limitations of any extant game. This is true for you as well I assume
 ^_^#9116: I should sleep
 hehe boi#3720: For all the time I have been here, the most popular word (except for dice) has been idea
 Mrinin#2181: thank you, I'm sure your idea is frighteningly good as well, maybe better
 Z2D#3320: I just spent 2 hours getting hitstop working
 USER#8646: No you only get to roll 2 once beat a level
 budget#0365: My genius.....sometimes it's frightening
 USER#8646: Yeah ik but they should be short so maybe  it wont matter
 USER#8646: So after 1 win its 66% then 33% and 0%
 Among us#2308: but you could still get really easy levels at the end
 USER#8646: Im thinking every time you beat one there's 33% less chance you get it
 MrBen#0001: k k
 Among us#2308: thats a cool idea
 USER#8646: The idea is that you start of with 1 die and when you win you roll 2 and the higher numbered ones are harder not sure if it'll work
 JowelYudisi#4271: you skip tutorial and end up on the boss room, miyazaki would like this
 jschwitzer#0421: Ayyy
 NalaFala38290#9305: I have an idea but I don't have an idea
 jschwitzer#0421: Would you pull the level after it’s played?
 JowelYudisi#4271: could you start and roll double 6 and end the game directly?
 USER#8646: Yeah the idea is that depending on the result you play a level (ill have a system to reduce getting the same one a lot) and when you get double 6 its the final level
 caibi#5324: EEEEEEEEATING
 Among us#2308: this is a cool idea, but how are you going to balance it?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: chillin
 ^_^#9116: im fine
 Ogórek#7242: Hi how you guys doin
 Mr.Wip#9066: Yeah man it sucks
 caibi#5324: RIP (?
 jschwitzer#0421: Yo random level selection? That’s a cool use of the theme
 ^_^#9116: ohhhh f*ck
im sorry for you
 Mrinin#2181: I have a really good idea for a dice game... I'm not going to say it, but trust me it's really good
 USER#8646: Its my first game and i didn't want to make something super complicated so i just used them to determine level selection
 Mr.Wip#9066: Nah it's just I missed this year gamejam due to exams ;_;
 JoelOfWalse#8278: Originally I considered an RPG where you generated the world by unfolding dice with terrain on each face, but decided I wouldn't be able to make something I was happy with in the time limit, so there's a free idea
 JowelYudisi#4271: praise the dice
 JowelYudisi#4271: do whatever you like if the dice concept is there
 ^_^#9116: no i dont think so
 hehe boi#3720: Yeah just fight through or something...
 USER#8646: Is it bad if im using dice in quite a literal way
 ^_^#9116: you got this
 Mr.Wip#9066: Fuck the exams, alright thanks 😭
 JoelOfWalse#8278: Anyways, while rolling around with a fever, I think I'm going to base something on... Mega Man Battle Chip Challenge, the GBA flop
 hehe boi#3720: Yes it is
 caibi#5324: only know about 3D, 2D is painful. I can only make a 3D game
 ^_^#9116: wohooooo
Profit is always good
 FryDev#0372: Next year
 hehe boi#3720: Yeyeyeyeyeyeyyes
 Aeph#4622: I think it's good, allows for a lot of interpretations that in my opinion is trying to divert away from platformers
 ^_^#9116: fair deal?
 Mr.Wip#9066: Ummm I don't want to break your topic but when is the next gamejam =))
 hehe boi#3720: Awesome, 100% profit
 caibi#5324: nice suggestion! I’ will write it down
 FryDev#0372: eh, I really don’t have any ideas that I like, maybe I’ll just do the art for someone’s game
 ^_^#9116: i hope so
btw i think its time to share your money
u got from the 0.00 we made 0.00
 mimmoO#6880: i dont think i like this years theme 😦
 JoelOfWalse#8278: I have finally sat down, but unfortunately I had The Illness delivered to me a few days ago so here's hoping I have enough strength for this
 graygray#8956: While out of control, make sure especially with jump and sprint that the player can control how they do that. You want the player to feel constrained not limited or forced
 caibi#5324: oh fuck I think this idea is bad, I just found that someone already do that in out of control, **FUCK**
 Joel_Overdue#7850: i feel like theres already a discussion happening here but do any of you have good playlists for music
 JowelYudisi#4271: rolling luck just to see if you can advance a bit? may be cool but kinda frustrating if luck isn't on your side, isn't it?
 hehe boi#3720: This could go on forever lol
 SaadTheGlad#9716: Tip for people who are struggling to find an idea: it doesn't have to be wholly original, you can use other games as a backbone and start adding your own flair until you make a game of your own
 (유)니티 좋음/나찰 니티#7281: Can you do anything else than programming? Like art or music?
 ^_^#9116: yes you are
:)
 Aeph#4622: I'm just going for a simple platformer, this is my first game jam so I'm trying to not scope creep
 hehe boi#3720: Woooooooooooooooooaaaaaaah I'm soooooo gooooood
 ^_^#9116: cool
btw great job at doing nothing rn
you just got promoted to ceo
 caibi#5324: I’m woke up, the theme is roll of the dice, my idea is that the “attack” “defense” “sprint” and “jump” is all by the RNG, basicly player “can’t” control the charact(it’s like out of control….)
 Ahat#0842: my art is fine, im good at small/ kinda simple graphics
 hehe boi#3720: Ok sure!
 GODFATHER#6766: appreciate that but my skills are not that solid to make a game by myself so I was really looking forward to have a team and experience this oppertunity
 ^_^#9116: ur welcome to join the team and do nothing just like me
 Cunnah#9270: right I am off to bed good luck all 🙂
 Minus#1843: remember, even if your art is not best, it is yours, and hey, I am a programmer here, my art skill is: "Yep this is brush" 😛
 JowelYudisi#4271: is someone going out with a horror game?
 ^_^#9116: i cant send pics
imagine a d20 here that does nothing
 hehe boi#3720: Ahhh that's annoying cuz the idea is soooo good!
 Ahat#0842: many times when im looking at other peoples art i get discouraged, thinking theirs is better, but then i think, they have a style, i have a style
 Minus#1843: "And dice number 4 is now entering scene in a sick drift, is it going to be 4 or maybe 6??!?! Nobody could expect this outcome, our judges will have tough time scoring this one. We'll be back after short ad break with Dices on Ices!" 😂
 ^_^#9116: yeah
i already made the game
 (유)니티 좋음/나찰 니티#7281: I'm not looking to make a game with somebody but I can help you if there are problems on unity
 JowelYudisi#4271: i wanted to use a D20 but that would make moving a bit boring for my idea :c
 BetterThanYou#4809: when you have a plan that takes the whole game jam that you did not know about -_-
 100th_Coin#4059: Welp, I'm already throwing in the towel. I'll see ya next year, ha!
I was gonna make a dungeon crawler where you pick up dice, and when entering a new room, the faces of the dice all have rooms on them. You can look them over, pick the dice, throw it, whatever room is face up on the dice is the next room you enter. maybe you'll get enemies, or treasure, or the boss of the dungeon.
I think I scoped too hard, and I'm gonna do something else this weekend. good luck everyone!
 Ricky#5210: I'm interested to see how many people are gonna play around with non-D6 dice; seems like an interesting avenue for people into tabletop stuff
 JowelYudisi#4271: DICE on dices electric bogaloo
 hehe boi#3720: Hmm why not... that's such a coincidence
 GODFATHER#6766: I got no luck finding a team for Game Jam :
 Reemus#7953: Mine was DICE rolling over because they are a failed game design company.
 Cedetis#4838: dices on mices
 ^_^#9116: good idea
for some reason i had a similar idea
we should make a team
 JowelYudisi#4271: DICE developers trapped on a dice full of dices rolling
 Minus#1843: dices on ice
 ^_^#9116: dude get some sleep and be productive today (but later)
 hehe boi#3720: My idea: something to do with dice
 MrBen#0001:  ! I love capybaras!
 Capybara#8868: that sounds interesting but sounds like a pain to make in 48 hours
 Reinspieler#2067: Dumbest idea to make a physical Dice and cant get it up and running
 (유)니티 좋음/나찰 니티#7281: I hope someone would make physics simulation of dices
 JowelYudisi#4271: yeah we're doing turns like the ones with a destroyed sleep schedule and the ones with normal life schedules
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i'm going a route i'm like sure almost nobody else is going to go
 Ricky#5210: I was thinking about something with the geometry of the dice, like a sokoban-esque game where the numbers on the dice are important (which might be fun since I've been on a Baba is You kick recently) but I think I want it to still have randomness be thematically there while still being puzzly; I have an idea I'm gonna toy with a little bit
 Minus#1843: just don't overwork yourselves, if you feel you need to - sleep, trust me it will be better than trying to do something without a single drop of energy left
 JowelYudisi#4271: first time too, we're kinda hyped doing stuff nonstop
 Minus#1843: that's good, ask people for help on according channels, do stuff, make things, create epic bugs and have fun!
 Teslobo#8274: I've seen 1 or 2 puzzle games gestating that use dice without being random. You can do it!
 Kn0cktane#7320: I also just got off work and I'm in the same boat lol
 yugioh#7402: One billion dices
 ItsYoBoiChad#1806: It doesn't necessarily have to be about randomness, you could make a puzzle game involving dice
 JowelYudisi#4271: my idea: walk with a dice
 Pydude#7379: My idea: a lot of dices
 EternalTurtle#0554: first time doing a jam, this is fun
 MrCurt#0695: 🗿 thank you
 Glitch#1483: Maybe you could make a puzzle game about making dice? Like from dice nets.
 (유)니티 좋음/나찰 니티#7281: I really like the idea, I think it's pretty good
 MrCurt#0695: Hm... I had one bullet hell inspired idea, where you need to roll the dice to replenish ammo and health (also provides a damage boost) at the cost of rolling a random number from 1-9, causing a random effect... But I think I can do better.
 Ricky#5210: Just got off of work so I'm brainstorming ideas now; hurts to be a puzzle game fan when the jam theme is very closely related to randomness lol
 JowelYudisi#4271: outdoors isn't a word on my dictionary
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: yeah but like i prefer not to reinforce unhealthy approaches to work and art honestly, not even as a joke. it's a bit like self-demeaning jokes. after a while you actually start believing 'em
 Hobusu#5033: Also a reminder to everyone that the submission deadline is pinned in this channel, and there's a more precise countdown on the itch.io page for the Jam!
 (유)니티 좋음/나찰 니티#7281: Okay.. I think...
 JowelYudisi#4271: Well i' still placing walls everywhere it's been 2h placin walls, only 20% of the map is covered im feeling bad
 Teslobo#8274: I've seen some impressive stuff in 
 hatoving#4710: ah gotcha
 (유)니티 좋음/나찰 니티#7281: Oh okay thanks! It's my first gmtk game jam
 worm#9050: not good!!!! still thinking of an idea!!!
 Sapient#3138: Dude i meant it as a joke
 SleepyBoi#7678: Hows the game jam going
 Jolomoju#6021: I'm still updating my unity '-' oh gosh
 Hobusu#5033: __Remember that the last two hours are for submissions, you should not try to improve your game during that time__
 Sapient#3138: Hmm maybe like have a rougelike with enemies as dice , and when they die they roll
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: pal i ain't sacrificing my health and wellbeing for a game that's going to sit in my itch going untouched for eons until another jam starts and i go "oh hey yeah i made this does anyone wanna check"
 Error Loading...#6270: So it’s a cooking game with dice where they only make rolls like sushi rolls my team didn’t decide on this idea but I thought it was funny :)
 yumaikas#3530: I haven't started programming my jam entry yet. We do have an idea, and the artist has started on stuff, though
 Teslobo#8274: every 5 hours is 10% of your time.
 whataboutme#3895: I don't even have a game idea and we've used 5 hours already
 Sapient#3138: Wait that is impossible  ,  What am I seeing good sleep patterns during a jam ,... IMPOSSIBLE
 (유)니티 좋음/나찰 니티#7281: 6 hours they added additional 2 hours so it's actually not 48 hour but 50
 sbubby#4885: day 0, what the team decides is most appropiate to begin work on
- 1 person working on prototyping
- 2 people making sprites
at least the art will be decent ig
 Riley#2192: google chrome has imploded
 hatoving#4710: eyo
 Sapient#3138: Wait 4hrs are nearly gone already...
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: and i have 8 hours of sleep ahead of me
 (유)니티 좋음/나찰 니티#7281: You guys have 1 day, 20 hours, 35 minutes, and 40 seconds
 MrCurt#0695: ...what the frick is a node...
 MrCurt#0695: ok time to learn how to use godot, design the game, make the sprites and then put it together
 Acu1000#5560: 5 minute break every half an hour can help with burnout
 ^_^#9116: dm or vc ?
 R2D2Vader#0693: laying down on a carpet is comfy (hopefully)
 hehe boi#3720: Yup
 Viatrix#3575: i feel like laying down on the carpet is better than working sometimes
 hehe boi#3720: Also that was 10 mins ago lol
 R2D2Vader#0693: oop-
 hehe boi#3720: Bit rude innit?!
 Kapcpa#2087: Yee i want mu game to have quite Basic and easy mechanics to understand it but the level of Madness around it should make it more intresting, tho already playing in a blank room with one enemy feels quite nice
 Doodles?#8052: Well, I unfortunately have to bow out of the jam; After 3 hours of troubleshooting, GMS2 on linux is just too unstable, and I'm not prepared to use any other devsuite right now. Best of luck to everybody!!
 ^_^#9116: ok gimme a sec i just need 1 more beer
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: mario
 R2D2Vader#0693: actually it's shoo|| they're gonna  make this dumb joke bannable aren't they 😭||
 hehe boi#3720: I should go sleep as I am in my bed at midnight rn, right?
 JJfriends#3686: gimmme a idea
 ^_^#9116: i know that he wanted to learn godot
 yumaikas#3530: Granted, I hope to have the basic mechanics in place for my game by end of tonight, I haven't really started yet
 budget#0365: Godot is a really weird thing language to begin with, sort of like learning rust to start
 jschwitzer#0421: All of you working on your games don’t know the struggle. I’m in an airport trying to pull from unity rn
 Acu1000#5560: yeah Im going to sleep gn everyone
 budget#0365: Probably better to start him with python or something
 yumaikas#3530: That's quick!
 Teslobo#8274: Regular reminder not to overwork yourselves. Get some rest at an appropriate time of night.
 Acu1000#5560: nice
 ^_^#9116: same
 Kapcpa#2087: Yoo i finished most mechanics needed at this point! Now just wave system, enemy variety, polishing, graphics and sounds 😅
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: aaaaaaaaalright i think i have an idea. it's not the most original thing ever but it's an homage of a game that i really care about for what it's doing with its mechanics.
 hehe boi#3720: I'm not working on my game rn, just chatting and chilling
 ^_^#9116: what happend
how could i help you?
 Fox#3756: Was hoping to have a prototype complete before I go to bed, but I took too long to finalise an idea. Guess I'll just stick with this one and hope it's fun. Anyway, good luck to everyone not yet going to sleep; see you all tomorrow!
 hehe boi#3720: Got me there
 ^_^#9116: lmao good one
 ^_^#9116: no idea hes sleeping rn but ig godot
 hehe boi#3720: Its alright don't worry
 budget#0365: Nice, what is your friend starting with
 JJfriends#3686: SHIT
 Jellogramming#4653: it already dropped, it's "roll of the dice"
 yumaikas#3530: Depends on tech, I often go level-based in Godot, and more procedural in stuff like Love2D, but either can work
 Technically Insane#9013: the theme is "roll of the dice"
 hehe boi#3720: It has lol
 ^_^#9116: btw good news
i forced my friend to learn coding  and i gonna learn design and stuff and next year i compete with you all
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: When does the theme drop?
 Acu1000#5560: Make the core part first, add more features later
 budget#0365: Just try not to lose yourself in the process of allocating too many, keep in mind a strong foundation is paramount
 wren#0640: i hope im in there by the end of tomorrow lol
 hehe boi#3720: I wonder how the  chat will be tomorrow
 Jellogramming#4653: good luck
 Stopa#6148: I am trying to scrap as most features as possible... hopefully we'll be able to make it in time...
 budget#0365: An rpg idea I had was that you pick one or two primary stats to roll for in combat and then you have to take the excess of whatever you didn't roll and allocate it somewhere else
 ^_^#9116: thanks
 hehe boi#3720: Understandable
 Reptilian135#9436: you can use perlin noise to make a randomly generating map and make it a servival game woth other randomized features
 ^_^#9116: thought so too
but my music is so good that i just dont want to sleep rn
so im here and still vibing
 brandonhs#5941: I am almost finished with starting my game
 Doooofus#0314: I think I'll just go level based then, just gotta flex those design muscles a bit,thx a bunch
 Jellogramming#4653: no, but unless it's a very small RPG, you're probably overscoping
 wren#0640: i think im almost mechanically finished? i might add some stuff to make the later levels more interesting but other than that i think i have a good base for future levels
 Acu1000#5560: If you can handle it on time
 hehe boi#3720:  I thought you were asleep lol
 ^_^#9116: nope
get creative and have fun
 budget#0365: It saddens me I don't have a ton of time so I can't really justify participation, this is one of the coolest ideas I've seen
 Lyfe#8258: i am almost finished with my "game"
 Stopa#6148: Are we too crazy if our team decided to make an RPG?
 Acu1000#5560: go to sleep. now.
 hehe boi#3720: It's hard to get a good idea straight away, you could try modify it on the way
 Jellogramming#4653: make the player be able to go through the tutorial at their own pace
 ^_^#9116: already postet here but i dont want to make you to scroll to the whole text here
what if: you take a rpg  but the Player is a dice and everytime you doge **ROLL** it rolls the dice, this then gives you a + or - on speed/atk or something
Just an idea tho
 budget#0365: You could theoretically make an entire level of a platformer a tutorial, just one you'd never realize is a tutorial if you're already competent at the game
 Jamesor#6153: ok thanks!
 Doooofus#0314: Hm true
 MCCV#1542: Uhg I can't think of an idea
 budget#0365: The best solution to this is to just make your tutorial incredibly easy so long as you get it. The tutorials in portal aren't that annoying because if you know what you're doing you're out of there in seconds
 Acu1000#5560: try asking in unity discord
 MrBen#0001: OFF my head hurts
 MCCV#1542: Shader graph: Perlin noise on render texture UV
 Doooofus#0314: Ye I think so too I'm just a bit worried players might not wanna play a game with a tutorial
 budget#0365: But you are right in that a more wholistic experience you'd want a strong starter which often falls flat in that context
 budget#0365: Level based games are super nice in that tutoralization is very easy
 Jamesor#6153: hello everyone, I was wondering If anyone here knows how can I make a drunk wobbly effect in Unity. Idk if this is the best chat for this lol
 japson#4917: Ey got the idea 👌 good night every one make sure to get enough sleep! 😊
 Doooofus#0314: What's your guys general approach do you go for a level based game or more procedural structure ? Feels like level based games are bit harder to design a compelling start for
 hehe boi#3720: Yeah go on
 Danny Dan Dan#6699: My brain is totally fried, I should probably take a food break huh?
 Msipp#6059: idk why the animation doesn't work tho, it's coded to workk andthere's no error, but it just doesn't work
 Msipp#6059: ok
 Jellogramming#4653: goodnight
 hehe boi#3720: And it becomes silent...
 Woum#5790: 'night 'night, going soon too
 Lukey#6052: goodnight!
 SomeTingOdd#8346: goodnight!! :>
 GuyWithTime#7852: aight I think imma go to sleep with 41 hours on the clock
Goodnight everyone and have fun jamming! 👋
 budget#0365: This reminds me of how certain hackathons are run, public channels in a normally private server
 ^_^#9116: 
 hehe boi#3720: Great! Me too
 SomeTingOdd#8346: ohh is this server patron-only after the jam?
 Lukey#6052: Ok main-ish game stuff is done :D\
 ^_^#9116: ok i go and sleep
need some concentration to play some games from yall tomorrow/ today
c ya next year ig 
 budget#0365: That was a joke but I see now how that might have been unclear. I probably won't participate this year just because I don't have time, I actually really love the theme though. I love the idea of a game about rolling dice minimizing randomness
 Danny Dan Dan#6699: I finished making the basic gameplay!
 hehe boi#3720: Fun fun fun!
 eMChe#3779: And number equals damage dealt? 😄 That would be fun btw
 Acu1000#5560: Yeah but going to bed at 3am is pretty late, try to reduce it to at least midnight, it will make you feel healthier
 GuyWithTime#7852: Yeah GameJams are there to have fun and learn something new.
If you feel exhausted dont feel forced to keep working and take a break :D
 skonn dinasir#9002: the game is impossible to play rn
 hehe boi#3720: It's 1 hours late for me
 ^_^#9116: good morning everyone (its 0:00 for me)
 L3mmy♡#2307: If you're stressing about it, go take a break, you're not meant to stress until last day at least
 farkon00#0500: 45 hours left, i am going to sleep. Good night to everyone!
 Plide#2447: No i litterally mean I go to bed around 3AM unless I force myself. Game jams ironically might make me go to bed earlier because they require more focus than my usual scedule, which means I get tired faster.
 budget#0365: My idea is to have a fighting game where you simply determine the winner based on rolls, no input required
 hehe boi#3720: How's that gunna work?
 CC426#0243: I mean it’s extremely Basic. Probably add a few more stuff and Clean things up but other than that I’m almost done
 ^_^#9116: u can do it
 Acu1000#5560: You should try to relax then and don't overthink
 skonn dinasir#9002: ive thought of a theme and have a basic platformer without using the theme, time to add the theme
 GuyWithTime#7852: hehehe >:D
 Technically Insane#9013: welcome to game development
 Acu1000#5560: Try to reduce it a bit, it'll be healthier
 ^_^#9116: pls dont
 Ber#3410: im going insane 😭
 Plide#2447: Does he have his phone? If so, you can contact him for advice.
 ^_^#9116: ouch
im sure you still gonna crush it
 Plide#2447: Never stayed up past my bed-time for a game jam... but keep in mind I usually go to bed at 3AM anyway.
 ThatIsANoNoWord#5311: All I can think of is that you roll the dice to reload a weapon and the result of the roll is what weapon you obtain
 Acu1000#5560: rip
 hehe boi#3720: Yeah for some reason I'm the same too
 GuyWithTime#7852: Congrats! 👏
 Pygocentrus#8974: The thing that sucks is my friend that has been learning game design with me is stuck across in another state without his computer
 CC426#0243: IDK why but I think I’m like half done with my game. Jesus. Gdevelop is easy to use
 GuyWithTime#7852: With that said I think I should go to sleep soon
 Acu1000#5560: You're not stupid, you're just inexperienced. And the only way to change that is actually making things
 ^_^#9116: great
 Ber#3410: 🤣 not when im stupid
 hehe boi#3720: I am basically done ( yay :) ) just need the level, background, main menu and sounds
 GuyWithTime#7852: That was my mistake in the last gamejam I participated in :/
Stayed up till 4am and wasnt even worth it lmao
 Acu1000#5560: You can go solo like many people here
 MrBen#0001: yeah making game at night is good for everyone. good point
 Acu1000#5560: its not good for anyone
 Ber#3410: 😭 i dont like gamejams people never use the same thing as you which means you cant even make teams
 GuyWithTime#7852: Hell yeah! I already learned something new so thats cool
 MrBen#0001: I dont think that making game at night is good for 15 yo like me lol
 L3mmy♡#2307: Gotta start somewhere!
 Plide#2447: Woo! My unity project is loading! Woo I bet it's gonna load so much faster than everyone else's!
 hehe boi#3720: Ofc
 Jolomoju#6021: I'm starting right now without a team T_T Will try my best
 Soup#3034: i dont think anyone else has come up with my concept
 GuyWithTime#7852: Surprinsingly yeah I've come up with an idea that should be fairly easy to complete over the weekend
 L3mmy♡#2307: Are y'all have a blast too ? that's the most important part
 Acu1000#5560: get some rest now, you work faster when rested
 wren#0640: my games going really well actually?????
 Plide#2447: I mean-- nothing's gone AGAINST plan yet...
 ^_^#9116: i just try to motivate ppl and vibe to good music
 Rilic#8461: I've never made a shmup before, let alone make a shooter in Godot, so I'm panicking :'3
 Technically Insane#9013: yep!
 hehe boi#3720: K yeah
 MrBen#0001: true 👀
 L3mmy♡#2307: how's everyone doing ? Everything's going to plan so far ?
 Jolomoju#6021: That's exactly what game jams are for!! Its a great boost, don't give up
 Acu1000#5560: use a bed
 Rilic#8461: A noble goal
 Plide#2447: Sounds fun!
 ^_^#9116: then get some sleep and do it tomorrow
gn
 Technically Insane#9013: i thought of stat randomization, but i challenged myself to have no rng this jam
 MrBen#0001: I need rest
 Acu1000#5560: Ben is speedruning it
 Rilic#8461: Idk if this idea fits so I'd love some feedback:
It's a space shoot-em-up where your stats are randomised at the end of the wave. The points you earn during the wave can be spent on making the rolls better permanently, but you run the risk of having stronger enemies spawn in the next wave. So it's a **roll of the dice** to see if you keep those stats after that wave.
I did it, I said the theme haha laugh
 MrBen#0001: sure man I was working on the for 5 hours now strtaight and im tired
 dark prince of kisses#3874: been spending the better part of the afternoon trying to figure out how to make isometric cubes rotate on grid lines in unity and also begging Midjourney for some nice concept art
 Mukhavertolet#2243: that's great, i just came up with a concept
 Plide#2447: Don't worry, I do have an idea, I'm just waiting for the Unity project to load. (and also I was here 4 hours late because I thought the jam was tomorrow)
 Acu1000#5560: a game jam can be a nice opportunity to work on these skills
 ^_^#9116: make a little dice animation and then it fits the theme
 Ber#3410: o
 GuyWithTime#7852: ouhhhh nicee
 clearlyyoudonthaveanairfryer#6669: im gonna go for a beat em up style game
 hehe boi#3720: Just try it out! My first game was a game jam game
 Ber#3410: gamejams are annoying honestly
 Acu1000#5560: if you need ideas look in 
 Technically Insane#9013: me and my team got our core mechanics done essentially, and we are kinda making movement look good and spicing up some stuff, we are making a retro puzzle game 🙂
 Pygocentrus#8974: I just love this event
 JJfriends#3686: I'm going to make a game about drugs
 syelan34#3258: I don’t know any unity either, that’s why I’m making a 2d puzzle game it’s way easier to make as a browser gamr
 Plide#2447: I haven't even started yet :)
 hehe boi#3720: My game will be 1 huge level with lots of different paths
 clearlyyoudonthaveanairfryer#6669: ikr, it is so cool
 Ber#3410: bad
 Nimerya#3837: Only got the general idea just need to break it down to make doable xD
 Pygocentrus#8974: I don't feel comfortable with my game design skills to participate this year since I just started
 MrBen#0001: yep. I have menu, pause menu and 8 levels :)
 hehe boi#3720: And better than mine
 syelan34#3258: Ok completely different concept lol
 Dimitri#4646: what do you guys think is the best choice of renderer for game jams in unity, hdrp or urp?
 Scolon#4218: I'm doing great, coding a lot of stuff
 Ber#3410: nope, i have 0 clue about unity or anything else because im stupid 😃
 GuyWithTime#7852: Dude I looked into  and I love how every idea is kinda different /s
 Technically Insane#9013: how have yall been doing?
 Jolomoju#6021: Similar to mine too 😮
 Plide#2447: Currious, In my game, I plan to make to mess around with 2d physics for the first time, and the idea is that dice will fall, and you have to get them to land on high numbers using projectiles, without getting crushed by the dice.
 syelan34#3258: Can you do a different language? Because yeah not many people use scratch
 hehe boi#3720: Pretty neat tbh
 dark prince of kisses#3874: dice are more than just rng :)
 Ber#3410: the day is almost over and i still dont have the main part of the game 😃 because i cant find a single person here that knows scratch
 Msipp#6059: I HATE IT
 Mukhavertolet#2243: is it playable already?
 hehe boi#3720: Ooooooh ok
 bug#4987: I'm just making Mario party without the Mario
 MrBen#0001:  am I doing good?
 syelan34#3258: Hmm similar concept as mine I think
 clearlyyoudonthaveanairfryer#6669: mario party uses dice
 Msipp#6059: WHY that doesn't make any- UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
NOT EVEN THIS DUMB IDEA WORKS WITH THIS GODDAMN THEME I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT
 GuyWithTime#7852: oop-
 Plide#2447: My game will only have a small amount of randomness, since it's going to be a game where you have to manipulate the dice.
 hehe boi#3720: In this theme, how?
 p3u#6651: yep, for me, it's a valid interpretation
 farkon00#0500: Hmm i have a brilliant idea, that i can add to my game idea. I can display little dice in the corener every time i call any random function
 syelan34#3258: It’s really not that random, instead I made it so you roll the dice in the direction that you are going, so like you start with 3 then clicking forwards will make you go forwards by 3 then you have 1
 ^_^#9116: what if: you take a rpg (or whatever this genre from dark souls or elden ring is called) but the Player is a dice and everytime you doge **ROLL** it rolls the dice, this then gives you a + or - on speed/atk or something
Just an idea tho
I dont have a team or any experience but if someone wants to take this idea as a start, feel free to use it
 Msipp#6059: ok it IS the cooldown
 clearlyyoudonthaveanairfryer#6669: someone gonna make mario party i bet
 GuyWithTime#7852: Yeah sure
 AlexBR#3963: Dice ≠ randomness
 Plide#2447: Honestly, that horror game that is in the roll of the die sounds like a great idea.
 MrBen#0001: Hey can I interprete the theme as: Press a key do to random, unexpected action just as rolling a dice?
 Hederlunden#3231: good night everyone, i am still prototyping my idea lol, it's super risky and idk if it will even work and be balanced :/
 hehe boi#3720: Everybody is working on a specific thing yet I am just making whatever pops in my head
 Ber#3410: white box nothing else
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: aaaaaaaaauuuuuuugggghhhhhhh i have no idea what to make :(
 Michel#2879: The slowmode is very annoying
 PolygonHead#5785: "* Have a game where the player doesn't know what they're doing."
 ^_^#9116: no idea
 Michel#2879: I thought of puzzle games tbh but then thought "how can puzzles work with randomness"
 ^_^#9116: could i dm you ?
 Plide#2447: Now I'm waiting for my new Unity project to open in the editor for the first time :D
 TheZipCreator#8673: here's some AI generated ideas
```
Game jam theme: Roll of the die
List of ideas:
* A game based on a dice roll. The player rolls a dice and it tells them where to go, or what action they do in that scene. 
* A game with random encounters, but instead of being a monster you encounter a building. Then you can either explore the building or leave, depending on what your results are from rolling the die.
* Instead of exploring an area, get a random result and follow it. If you don't like how things play out, try again. Repeat until you find something you want to do.
* Use a die as a weapon. This could be very simple or complex. It is up to you!
* Use dice as currency. When you buy something the shopkeeper asks for the lowest number possible.
* Make a game about rolling dice and surviving. You only have so many numbers before you die. Survive by rolling well.
* Create some kind of horror game where the player has no idea what will happen next. They have to keep rolling the die hoping not to die.
* Have a game where the player doesn't know what they're doing. A lot of times it's best to go along with it and see where the die leads them. Sometimes it's better to run away from danger. Or sometimes it's better to stay and fight.
* Make a game about a player who can't control their destiny and has to roll the die every time they want to do anything.
* Have a game where all the enemies are randomly generated.
* Make a game where there is a random event at the beginning of each level. ```
 yumaikas#3530: You could roll to decide which idea you'll make
 Minus#1843: adventure, arkanoid, fighter, RTS, or simple turn based game
 Vabenil#5485: Alright this time I'm really going to sleep. Cya
 clearlyyoudonthaveanairfryer#6669: hey guys
 pogrammerX#1167: see yall tomorrow!
bye!
 Vabenil#5485: RPG, city builder, tower defence
 hehe boi#3720: Oooh I would
 syelan34#3258: I’m doing a puzzle game with a kind of weird concept
 farkon00#0500: I guess `_ready` is more of a main, then process. Use godot for this jam too
 yumaikas#3530: Nah, C# made Java better, both as a riff on it, and by putting pressure on the Java committee
 ajedro#4638: dont you dare
 GuyWithTime#7852: Top Down shooter
 Ber#3410: please answer
i have a question if putting timezone is optional how come i cant make the post with it empty??????
 hehe boi#3720: Lol I have a good idea already its just a joke
 Tustin2121#6219: I prefer something starting a `require` call or maybe a `(function(){` if pressed
 farkon00#0500: I prefer
`if __name__ == "__main__": main`
 iceberglettuce#4394: I still have no ideas, can someone give me a random game genre so I can start working on something lol
 Borna#7759: func _process(delta)
 MrBen#0001: bruh I have 8 lvls now
 Michel#2879: 23:43
I usually stay up to 5 AM. To avoid the hot hours of the morning 
 GuyWithTime#7852: Make a game where its just a cube spinning and all the textures are rick astley
 Plide#2447: int main()
 farkon00#0500: Ok, that's my idea. Use it!
 Minus#1843: I prefer void main(int argc, char** argv)
 Plide#2447: static void main(string[
 hehe boi#3720: I could make a game with rick Astley as a dice...
 Ahat#0842: making a die into a character is hard
 GuyWithTime#7852: Cool same
 coronelrsm#8055: repeat with me: public static void main(String []args)
 awsumturtle#2957: same
 farkon00#0500: I am listening
 Michel#2879: oh nice.
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: 23:42
 syelan34#3258: i think it's +5 then
 Minus#1843: 23:42 :V
 Ber#3410: i have a question if putting timezone is optional how come i cant make the post with it empty??????
 Vabenil#5485: 00:42
 hehe boi#3720: It's almost 11 oclock
 Beeg scarf#3571: EST is BEST time zone
 Lukey#6052: 9:42am
 GuyWithTime#7852: Out of curiosity, what time is it for y'all?
 Michel#2879: yeah Java is like the difficulty of typing in a mid level language combined with the inefficiency of high level languages and for some reason I still like it
 syelan34#3258: this is why i'm doing 3 levels for now
 Ber#3410: nothing on the create post thing is est
 hehe boi#3720: About the dice and rick roll though...
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I'm gonna go sleep aswell. I need to be awake early tommorow to be ready to play games all day :D Take care everyone!
 Borna#7759: i might literally be killed by scope creep
 syelan34#3258: EST
 Tustin2121#6219: I'm pretty sure there's whole academic papers on this subject, "detecting if a program will finish".
 hehe boi#3720:  it's fine if you wanna know btw
 Vabenil#5485: It may not end up looking perfect but it's better than nothing
 ajedro#4638: it was the cow part, what if you get resources based on dice?
 Michel#2879: ik just kidding
 coronelrsm#8055: as a java developer, I can confirm that java is trash
 hehe boi#3720:  eoah woah I don't wanna lose it
 Vabenil#5485: You could find some pixelated icon pack and with something like Photoshop or gimp, put those icons on cards maybe recolour them and BOOM! You got yourself a deck
 Michel#2879: what's it💀
 Tustin2121#6219: Blasphemy, C# is the better version of Java. C# actually does generics correctly, instead of erasing them all.
 hehe boi#3720: Wait can't I make a game about rick..?
 IceyMations#9584: gl to you
 syelan34#3258: i have 85 lines of if else statements for a single movement direction
 PolygonHead#5785: Same
 JJfriends#3686: I can't think of anything shit dude
 ^_^#9116: thats neat
 Michel#2879: C# feels like They tried to fix Java but they made it worse instead
 hehe boi#3720: I am so happy that nobody has thought of my idea
 IceyMations#9584: Then he will finally get rolled
 ^_^#9116: dont ask me
everything i know is how to code "hello world" in python
 Michel#2879: ty
 Tustin2121#6219: That's an impressive reply-non-sequitur. I'm interested in what idea you got from "slamming if elses", lol.
 1Am2Good4You#4414: Seeing how I have pretty specific themes, as well as a need for consistency when it comes to the cards, it is a lot more difficult to find art
 JJfriends#3686: im getting scamme
 Plide#2447: I'm 4 hours late, but I'm ready to start my game :D
 IceyMations#9584: I’m done with level 1, tutorial, and credits screen there will be 6 levels, and the dice has no six side and you play as the dice, you go through the levels collecting 6 dots, and at the end once you get all six you get the sixth side
 Ber#3410: what timezone do i choose for the post thing in the team finder
im canadian and in ontario hamilton what would i choose
 Michel#2879: Also I don't get why C# doesn't detect infinity loops
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Sleep well everyone!
 TheRayvenn#0001: I've barley started the project haha 😁
 ^_^#9116: cmon you got it
even if you dont finish it on time, keep going its all about experience
 kotadinmala#6222: I am going in too for the night . Goodnight guys good luck and have fun !
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: wish I could help. Maybe you can find some free to use assets?
 Vabenil#5485: Well, I'm gonna get some sleep. Good luck!
 Msipp#6059: let's try moving it
 Michel#2879: Going to bed. Never went to bed so early but this jam is tiring af
 syelan34#3258: Lol that’s what I’m doing
 ajedro#4638: holy shit, i have an idea for a managment game with dice
 1Am2Good4You#4414: If only artists would think that lol
 Ridley#0760: I think it's best to take the naive approach and just slam if elses until the cows come home
 kablouser#4232: That's pretty poggers
 Msipp#6059: i think it's cause i re-added the cooldown
 ^_^#9116: pls say that you have backups
 Msipp#6059: well i can't get the dice to change sides even tho i coded the roller AND my silly super shotgun is GONE
 Ridley#0760: (that's a joke, its not entirely my idea, but I'm a little stuck on how to properly do inheritance with this)
 Funguy1010101#5539: Well the idea is pass and play so one could try against themself. But i can see if i can make a simple enemy work.
 ajedro#4638: what is your idea? i suck at drawing but i am good at 3d
 Lukey#6052: wooooooooooooo! All the basic code is working so I am SO happy. Time to make the entire rest of the game :D
 DaforLynx#0296: Tip for inspiration: do menial chores like cleaning, or take a shower
 Ridley#0760: my idea is so good its a shame I suck at this
 syelan34#3258: Maybe try and make an ai, with a bit of randomness of course
 Zanthous#0112: you dont even have to make your own art, there are some free art sites linked on the jam page too
 Tustin2121#6219: The people testing the game (ie, all of us after the jam) are going to be solo players, so it's unlikely you'll get anyone to be able to review your game if its exclusively multiplayer.
 1Am2Good4You#4414: Well it's 6 cards on the screen, with same theme cards being able to be combined. All cards have different minigames, ranging from pure rng to skill-based ones. The more risky, the higher the reward
 ajedro#4638: i dont think so
 Michel#2879: I thought about 10 levels now I ll hope I can do 3 levels lmao
 LightLeviathan#1443: bro i can't even get movement code to work for my game
 Msipp#6059: ok
 syelan34#3258: I don’t think so but it’s better not to
 Michel#2879: I think mechanics is the hard part. Level design would be easy tho
 Funguy1010101#5539: Is there a rule against multiplayer?
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: devart is acceptable for a game jam
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: That sounds like a fun idea tho! I wish I could help you out, I just got some crappy pixelart skills
 Michel#2879: I still haven't finished the first level yet lmao
 kablouser#4232: Like Minecraft bingo?
 Tustin2121#6219: I remember that happening to me during the "out of control" jam, where I added something to my game and it caused the javascript to suddenly decide it needed 150% of my RAM, so I had to kill the browser forcefully (which took a half-hour) and then when it started back up, my browser had updated to suddenly hate WebGL and Hardware Acceleration and now suddenly the game is running at like 20% speed and I'm like "WHY?!?!?!?!?!" and it was literally at the start of day two...
 ^_^#9116: would love to help but i cant even draw a circle or a straight line
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: Trying to AI is hard
 1Am2Good4You#4414: It's supposed to be a fun multiplayer bingo game with cards with different minigames. Leaderboard goals
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: lmao poor code!
 Vabenil#5485: You could make a game where every time you kill an enemy you get a dice that can give you different types of weapons (each weapon having limited ammo to incentivize diversity) and/or armor and buffs although that feels a bit more rougelike.
To expand further you could make it so after throwing a dice there's a chance for a debuff or being thrown to a hard situation so that players can sort of "gamble", their way through the levels
 Lukey#6052: YES! The code is working :D
Turns out I have to apologize to the code, it was my fault. I was telling it to do two different things at the same time lol
 kablouser#4232: Hit me with your idea
 DaforLynx#0296: What's your idea? That's a bit of a judgement for someone to make...
 Big Cheese#7612: beautiful
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I'm not a great artist but, what was your idea if I may ask.
 Capybara#8868: you could always make your own art
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Oh?
 1Am2Good4You#4414: I have given up hope sadly. All artists I have contacted so far either found my current game idea "old fashioned" or "not their style" 😦
 DaforLynx#0296: quit shouting you're stressing the dogs out
 ^_^#9116: idk
 Msipp#6059: I DIDN'T CHANGE THE CODE AT ALL WHAT HAPPENED TO MY SUPER SHOTGUN
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: aww. Hope the code gets a bit of manners soon
 ^_^#9116: i thought thats normal
 Double_Gezicht#2599: Ello
 FloFlo#6826: nice
 Gumball#2577: Soup
 Lukey#6052: my code has decided to hate me
 Minus#1843: can we just agree that working is quite... vague term during jams? Let's go with "running and not crashing" 😂
 Evan Butterfield#7312: I have to share a laptop with my brothers so I'm gonna be grinding all night
 Msipp#6059: WHAT HAPPENED TO MY SUPER SHOTGUN
 ajedro#4638: yes, a working videogame in 48 hours
 Will#4481: thanks
 wumpus#3512: basically, it has to be fully digital ( as in game-wise, feel free to make irl images in it)
 Cunnah#9270: I have a manic red dice with legs and arms running about the place so things are ok
 Minus#1843: what has bagun? Jam, OH FRICK, I OVERSLEPT, FULL CRUNCH MODE ACTIVATED!
 farkon00#0500: I didnt even try to make it 3d. Just made a screen with 2 dices with question mark in the middle and change it to the right sprite when needed. Btw my game is 2d, so i think its ok
 Cunnah#9270:  tis ok took me a good few hours to actually figure out what I am making 😉
 Will#4481: i have one doubt about the rules, so the question maybe the question may seem stupid, but i don't speak english so good
whats this mean > You can not require the user print things out?
 BurnV06#5857: I’m in the top 10 first submissions
 ajedro#4638: i just realized that it begin XD
 wumpus#3512: with a scoring system, do you guys think i should be more lenient? or focus more actual skill? its a movement based game - and i dont know how i should go about this
 Cunnah#9270: just taking a break how is everyone doing?
 Minus#1843: WONDERFULL PROGRESS, KEEP IT UP, I still have to do my dices 😂
 mtoon#8128: 2days is short for proced gen
 pogrammerX#1167: ill just use another word
 ajedro#4638: you could make a dice that depending on what you get the world gets generated?
 Dragonite#5414: I have a working dice
 bbrainstormer#9101: The game jam page says no "extremely strong language" so unless you're using racial slurs or smth you're probably fine
 Minus#1843: add second dice for direction of acceleration - let the chaos begin
 Dragonite#5414: GUYS
 Will#4481: Hello!
 mtoon#8128: Ok so how to add dice into a platformer
 pogrammerX#1167: can i use the word "drugs"?
 Vabenil#5485: I got no ideas for that
 Ragh#5984: racing genre, you roll a dice and then your car acclerates by the dice amount
 Xurnt#2932: I didn't find an idea either yet (or at least an idea that would be good lmao) but I'm gonna keep searching all night if necessary
 FryDev#0372: a platformer
 Minus#1843: give us a genre and expect flood of ideas, better or worse, but still ideas 👌
 ajedro#4638: horror
 mtoon#8128: Give us a genre
 FryDev#0372: mhm, I’ll try to get something
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: May I suggest you think about it tommorow with a fresh head again about it? An idea will come to mind eventually. Never give up! Even if you don't finish try to make something!
 Minus#1843: here selling and idea, simple game, you are controlling a dice, with face that is shown on top of you is deciding on world, shwoing or hiding some stuff, move accordingly to reach end of the level :>
 Roof#6985: Never Give Up!
 farkon00#0500: Me neither, i just made one for learning godot
 olifire#9152: Dont quit! You'll get an idea soon.
 Action Dawg#5943: I did rip my camera controller from my actual game tho
 mtoon#8128: Start with a genre
 Vabenil#5485: It's too soon to think about quitting
 FryDev#0372: maybe I’ll just quit, I really just can’t get any ideas
 Minus#1843: my character controller decided at one point it is time for Cheap Space Program... and sent my character to lower earth orbit '-'
 vaamiart#5077: that's okey
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: Mind if I DM you for more details?
 Action Dawg#5943: I didn't have any idea of what I'd do going into it and I need a custom controller for this idea anyway so 🤷‍♀️
 Honzus24#7663: That's not bad a good idea is the most important thing
 farkon00#0500: F
 Vabenil#5485: Implementing the idea will be the hardest part though
 vaamiart#5077: hi, i have problems with 
 Minus#1843: hey that's better than trying to do RPG like Skyrim or Withcer with 3 days of free time 😅
 Gnebbers#0001: Not a huge fan of this year's theme, I feel like the focus on dice makes it less interesting (yes, I know you technically don't have to add dice) - the previous themes were better in that regard
 bbrainstormer#9101: Gosh, I'm stressing out.  I have nothing.
 Vabenil#5485: Nah, took me 4 hours to figure out my idea and get an asset pack
 farkon00#0500: But my main idea is too big. I understand that from a beggining i need like 6 mini boses + sprites for 6 location + mechanics for this locations
 Minus#1843: even Volition in Saints Row 2 used lorem ipsum in newspapers shown after completing a mission 😛
 Honzus24#7663: Have you already started guys?
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: obviously it's probably better to just use lorem ipsum or something
 Cat Sydromde#8405: its not like its ela class go nuts
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: Hi! How can I help, are you having an issue with the website?
 Vabenil#5485: If there's citation it's fair game
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: No that's fine!
 PowerZox#5241: If I need sample text am I allowed to just copy a Wikipedia page and cite it? Or is that plagiarism?
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: you only- no you already got that XD
 bbrainstormer#9101: "Your game must not contain nudity, or hateful language or visuals... Please consider avoiding extremely strong language and excessive gore, as the jam should be suitable for a general audience"
 farkon00#0500: 4 hours in and i only have rolling dice screen and working movement and shooting
 JowelYudisi#4271: yeah i'm trying to make the next short streamer horror game hahahaha
 Minus#1843: Good, we had internal crisis with possibility of scrapping our 3 hours of work, that would be devastating
 Cat Sydromde#8405: thanks
 vaamiart#5077: 
 Peewi#8572: the only content restriction mentioned in the rules is "no nudity"
 JowelYudisi#4271: i usually like to do some foreshadowing with the main concept, maybe something like a short adventure where you find out that you have been controlled by some dudes making a D&D game, idk
 bbrainstormer#9101: I have almost nothing
 farkon00#0500: Its why i used my controller, that i wrote earlier. I was in voice channel streaming, when i did that. And guy who was there said "yeh programming skills kekw"
 Vani079#5044: 4 hours in and i only have a single battle and 3 weapons (and one of them doesn't even work!)
 nut dealer#1157: yeah
 Cat Sydromde#8405: are horror games allowed?
 FryDev#0372: man, it feels like all my excitement has just completely fizzled out
 bbrainstormer#9101: check 
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Have a good night of sleep!
 davidnjihiahere#6326: what are everyone's ideas?
 USER#8646: found a website that says i am free to use them so i guess that counts
 olifire#9152: i just watched that lol
 nut dealer#1157: when is the deadline?
 RedVoxel#9210: Yes as long as you have rights to them
 Vabenil#5485: Depends how interesting movement feels, if there's something new or exciting after ever few moves then it wouldn't feel boring
 olifire#9152: yeah i dont rly wanna go with the first interpertations
 USER#8646: am i allowed to use sound effects i havent made myself
 Msipp#6059: you just shoot 8 bullets it's hialrous i love it
 olifire#9152: lol
 JowelYudisi#4271: if you are lacking ideas just take your time to think about the concept of a dice and not as probability or random things
 Action Dawg#5943: I just now got movement and face detection working  haven't even got any other elements in yet
 Galactum#6235: yea that's fair but I'm in that state where its like i dont know if im tired or not
 farkon00#0500: Sitting for 20 minutes, procrastinating and having brilliant ideas like "Rick Astley, but dice. You roll rick."
 MrBen#0001: man I was tryharding this. I need to take a break
 Squiggles#2157: prioritize your health, but if it were me id stay up xD
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Get some sleep in, start fresh tommorow!
 olifire#9152: still dont have one
 Galactum#6235: it's already midnight for me and I'm not sure if i should keep going or sleep
 farkon00#0500: Sorry, what?
 Dabt#7840: im out here with no good ideas, and im thinking to quit
 JowelYudisi#4271: i was thinking about 50 but wondering if it was too much, every step would be 1m
 olifire#9152: how do you guys come up with your ideas?
 Snakes#8442: Yeah I can’t really do any work until late tonight this is unfortunate
 Galactum#6235: depends on the game but maybe like 75 or 100
 Squiggles#2157: Anyone else stuck at work and cant work on anything till theyre off
 JowelYudisi#4271: if you were to roll a dice in order to move how many rolls would it take you to get bored
 Galactum#6235: I got basic mechanics working but not much else as of now
 Shroomax#3378: i just finished the basic stuff for my game, still need the special mechanics though
 Galactum#6235: nyoom 🌬️
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Send those games my way :D
 jef#7172: Daamn. Zooming huh
 Scolon#4218: I'll definitely keep ya in mind
 JowelYudisi#4271: when you wake up at 6 pm in summer that's not a problem anymore hahah
 vaamiart#5077: hi i don't have any groups right now, i can draw something
 bbrainstormer#9101: Lol I just got started
People are usually much less productive while sleep-deprived than they think they are.
Also this is a game-jam, and the purpose of this is to have fun, not torture yourself!
 NiallCrabtree#2618: our game is gunna need heeps of playtests, sent a friend request your way 🙂
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: jesus... I'm just stuck doing nothing until people throw their prototypes at me when i'm asleep XD
 farkon00#0500: No, i am going with my usual bad sleep schedule. But i guess i wont just lie in a bed half sleeping whole morning
 Morg#8585: i might push not sleeping a bit the first night because of sleep deprived bonus creativity, but i sleep on the second night to make sure im up early for the final morning
 |[ Fatal ]|#5771: Ill be sleeping. Otherwise id collapse on my desk.
 MrBen#0001: Im going fast I already did 7 levels for my game 👀  only in 4 hours
 Tustin2121#6219: It's literally impossible for me to pull an all-nighter. So sleep definitely.
 |[ Fatal ]|#5771: I made a game idea, an empty game project, planned 2 out of 9 lvls for my game. Do u think thts enough for today?
 MrBen#0001: Man
 Vabenil#5485: Although I'm a bit more creative when sleep deprived
 Msipp#6059: but i like how it works better now cause you shoot like 8 bullets and it's hilarous
 TheGameShePlays#7762: oh goodness no, I'll have plenty of rest and a nice bike ride tomorrow please!
 NiallCrabtree#2618: whoa we brought up the same topic
 Vabenil#5485: BTW, is someone thinking on going full crunch and not sleep? Won't be me though, I definitely can't work without sleep
 NiallCrabtree#2618: What are peeps strat for work/life balance with this jam? Anyone pulling all nighters?
 Morg#8585: im idling around doodling dice on paper, making games is fun
 Jasper#7906: roll of the dice
 jos3k4#6781: My first Game Jam BTW.... the feelings are amazing....Having live tomorrowland at the same time 😄
 jef#7172: Weird stuff is the best. Thats why I like jojo’s bizarre adventure
 Vabenil#5485: Art does restrict a lot for people like me who can only code and are going solo, I had to throw away a bunch of ideas because there was no way I was going to find an asset for them
 Galactum#6235: It's a pretty weird game tbh but i think it might be fun or at least interesting to play
 jef#7172: Hell yeah
 .Jony#4882: what is the theme though?
 Galactum#6235: I was going to brainstorm first but I decided maybe it would be a good idea to program a dice first and as I did that more ideas came to me
 1Am2Good4You#4414: It's a stylized bingo minigame game
 Msipp#6059: ok so it's not working
 TheGameShePlays#7762: What kind of thing do you need? There are lots of free resources
 jef#7172: Do stick figures then
 jos3k4#6781: Are you guys already working on your game or just ideas brainstorming?
 syelan34#3258: Same, or well I had an idea last year but never actually started
 jef#7172: Gonna be my first game jam yo
 syelan34#3258: See I have an idea but I don’t know if it’s any good
 1Am2Good4You#4414: I have a solid idea just no way of amassing the art I need in time 😦
 Light Maker 🍧#8953: Aight
 (유)니티 좋음/나찰 니티#7281: You could check out the jam page
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: check  and scroll a bit, so many good ideas in thee
 syelan34#3258: As long as you have the right to them you can use them
 Vabenil#5485: To be honest I'm already satisfied just having a solid idea
 FryDev#0372: I still need a dang idea
 Light Maker 🍧#8953: Do all assets have to be made for the jam or, if we have pre existing assets are they allowed to be used?
 GigaByte#0652: Nice got a game idea
 syelan34#3258: 4 hours in and I haven’t even started my first level
 Kapuche#0144: Well, if by focused you mean "created a folder and now wondering what's the meaning of life, the univverse and the rest" then yes, I'm focused
 Bolicob#7822: Thanks
 FryDev#0372: I’m not unfortunately
 Scolon#4218: I see everyone is getting quite focused now
 charlieee#6920: Ahh gotcha well good luck i hope that works out!
 GODFATHER#6766: Oh man I feel so excited about it but talking about my beginner level skills, i dont think I can find any team sad lol
 Bolicob#7822: All I've got is a desktop, but it looks like I might be able to take it to a friend's house
 PickleOstrich#2216: Does anyone potentially want an artist for this game jam
 FloFlo#6826: the real prize are the friends you made along the way
 BurnV06#5857: Just updated my game
 farkon00#0500: same
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: ok i should probably work on my game right now lol
 CrashCubeZeroOne#0715: fun
 TheGameShePlays#7762: personally, I usually make something I haven't made before, so I have to learn something new every time I do a game jam. makes me better! and makes me try things I wouldn't normally do
 Cearáj#9556: experience and getting a game done
 Lukey#6052: learning experience
 farkon00#0500: Its biggest jam, always has been
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: yes
 Vabenil#5485: I got an idea an asset pack and I guess I will go to sleep and hope can I can actually execute it well tomorrow
 Occelot Dan#3777: Dang, sorry to hear that friend. Hope you can find elsewhere to work!
 CrashCubeZeroOne#0715: gn
 Jasper#7906: the real prize is having made your game
 farkon00#0500: Gn
 GODFATHER#6766: oh so how do people benefit from this
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: this is probably one of the biggest jams, too
 Lukey#6052: my timezone means its the morning for me, but goodnight :D
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: No, theres no prize, were just excited just because its a game jam lol
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Goodnight everyone
 Wames#8409: Yeah same
 charlieee#6920: Can you work somewhere like a cafe with wifi or use ur phone?
 CrashCubeZeroOne#0715: If no one's taken the name "6: the game", I'm taking it
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: I think it's going ok for my first game jam, but the pace things are going means I probably overscoped my project a bit (ofc lol)
I'm going to sleep now and get back at it tomorrow morning
 Bolicob#7822: And I wasn't able to do it last year either 😩
 GODFATHER#6766: about this game jam, Im sorry it is my first time here so
 Msipp#6059: it's basically a spread shot thing
 Cearáj#9556: someone's gotta die
 charlieee#6920: Oh damn good luck hahaha
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: wdym
 Bolicob#7822: Man I took the days off and planned for this like 2 months in advanced too 😞
 TheGameShePlays#7762: mine involves several screens and I've made about a third of them, while I think about the gameplay 😅
 GODFATHER#6766: Is it also some prize or something that everyone seems so hyped about
 Fnessa#8531: i can move. and shoot. but not kill.
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: still working on my character controller (almost done w it though)
 Cearáj#9556: I'll check it out, thanks!
 Msipp#6059: dumber, it's a game where your attack is determined by RNG
 Catfish#2063: Hey guys how do u remove the emscripten border
 Roof#6985: alright guys so im thinking of making a game where when you shoot, you move? thoughts?
 LightHouse#2571: So how's everyone so far?
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: lol
 Occelot Dan#3777: Lots of great ideas floating around in  if ya wanna scroll through there!
 charlieee#6920: 1 sided die
 Ragh#5984: In doubt make a "shoot a dice to move" kind of game
 farkon00#0500: Because i tried to find mine as fast as possible. And i am not sure can i make this idea to work
 Cearáj#9556: ball dice
 Msipp#6059: got a dumb idea
 charlieee#6920: i feel you…. my power has been out for 3 days so I’m just hoping I don’t run out of phone data in the next 48 hrs hahah
 Cearáj#9556: same
 farkon00#0500: But may be you will have greatest idea, because you thought about it a lot
 Occelot Dan#3777: You're totally good fam! Plenty of folks are in the same boat, and you've still got lots of time.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: man i'm actually kinda stumped for ideas
 Riley#2192: bad roll of the dice 😭
 1Am2Good4You#4414: Hellooo! I am looking for someone who can do 2D art (all art required is made of images, with no player animation or anything)
 GODFATHER#6766: Does anyone wanna see my first tutorial based game I made, its only 3 levels but it was the project i started using Unity and learned from it...
 Bolicob#7822: This is so dumb! My internet went out at around 10 this morning and at&t can't send anyone to fix it till Tuesday 😫
 Reptilian135#9436: also i need to smooth out my camera
 ^_^#9116: i say unity
 farkon00#0500: So what engine are you using
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: you're going solo? (also cute pfp!)
 In Test#2981: I have an internship project to finish soon as possible sadly , but you guys motivated me to participate , So I'm in 😅 .
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I'm just sitting here without anything to do atm. I should sleep soon.
 GODFATHER#6766: Can I join a team or someone I would be very dedicated
 MaryStrawberry#4672: I'm done with my submission
_just kidding_ 😛
 Hederlunden#3231: man, everyone is getting far, while i'm still prototyping on paper and have done some graphics :/
 (유)니티 좋음/나찰 니티#7281: I can help you with tech part if you want..
 GODFATHER#6766: Umm I am a beginner I have only started working on Unity. But I am creative and I love brainstorming.
 farkon00#0500: No, we are only 3 and a half hours in.
 Hamezii#5472: where?
 Reptilian135#9436: no
 farkon00#0500: Are you using godot?
 Hederlunden#3231: no
 OP_idk#5593: No, it just started
 GODFATHER#6766: Is it too late to join Game Jam now....
 Acu1000#5560: rip
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: unity just crashed on me T_T
 Vabenil#5485: Itch.io has some great 2d asset packs I found exactly what I needed
 Giga chad#0085: Guys dont forget to create a backup!
 Acu1000#5560: Youre a human who got teleported into a world where everything is a board game
 Reptilian135#9436: im trying to have my characters damage random and items that increase the maximum but when i run into an item it gliches out and just starts doing a set amount how should i fix it
 BlenderStudent#4251: imagine a person making a open world rpg in 50hours
 Morg#8585: oh not like that, i'm writing a text adventure so i need to flesh out a setting and concept
 Acu1000#5560: you don't need a whole world for a 48h jam game
 Tustin2121#6219: Oh, is that why my screen was shaking at me before? Because of a slow mode? Discord, pls, communication...
 Morg#8585: im struggling not with an idea but just by having to build a world around it, writing is so not worth it
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: :D
 Balrajjjjjj#8760: headie one x gmtk
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: down to 30s
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: yeah good point
 Acu1000#5560: Is the 1 minute slowmode really necessary? The chat has calmed down now
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: so long as you have the rights to use them, yep 🙂
 Peewi#8572: yes. You can use any assets that you have the legal rights to use
 Tustin2121#6219: The theme is "Roll of the Dice"
 JuliusCube#8501: yes
 ThatTrashGameDEV#0639: can we use pre mad assets
 ImNotAsher#6733: wait is it today
 Occelot Dan#3777: You got this! Think of the project in terms of "layers," what individual parts do you need to build in order to make a functioning game/proof of concept, and then focus layer by layer
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: no restrictions!
 Crimson#0001: Finally, a like minded individual
 KadDev#8100: does the game jam have a restricion? I know the theme, but I was wondering if there was a restriction
 Acu1000#5560: alright then try your best, you'll still learn a lot
 Danny Dan Dan#6699: Even at its simplest, I just don't have a ton of game dev experience, so I'm spending a lot of time just setting up the player and controls
 pexx#1899: i spent 3 hour doing pixel art just to delete it 🤦‍♂️
 Giga chad#0085: can any of the mod just make this cooldown a bit shorter?
 Occelot Dan#3777: This is really good advice! I've also seen some neat ideas with the inverse, where someone takes a mechanic that is normally random and lets the player influence or control it.
 Vabenil#5485: I didn't event think about puzzles 🤔 , although I suck at designing puzzles so I can't use that
 Snake95991#6766: Ok, thank you very much!😁
 Acu1000#5560: simplify your idea then
 Scruffles#6362: people are already submitting?
 BurnV06#5857: It’s shoot to move lol
 Danny Dan Dan#6699: Man, I can already tell I'm not gonna be able to finish in time lol
 Delphine Noel#1196: We'll be seeing a whole lot of dice this year and a whole lot of puzzle games
 BurnV06#5857: Hell yeah just submitted (still gonna update it of course)
 The Dream#2457: That sounds like a good interpretation, I would go for it
 Vabenil#5485: You can just think about adding randomness to any of your ideas. Like if you are thinking on making an RPG you could make it so that you roll a dice to choose your weapon/skill or maybe your main ability could be that every X seconds you have to roll a dice to change your characters weapon. Maybe even something that could influence the enemies of the game, playing with natural disasters/events that might happen in a game also sounds fun
 Snake95991#6766: Hey, I've got an idea, but am not sure if it really hits the theme. Basically I am taking the definition of "Rolling a Dice" and constructing the Game around it, like you have to "roll the dice" in choosing what door you will go through and face the consequences etc. Is it too far removed from the theme or should I just go for it?
 Delphine Noel#1196: This cooldown is so high wtf just make it 5 sec what is this
 darlingS#1797: But enough talk, have at you!
 wren#0640: honestly if you have to start over now youre still in a pretty good spot i think
 Acu1000#5560: and a bunch of assets
 Beeg scarf#3571: What is a game? a miserable little pile of code
 Fenekito#9501: hello
 kylejramstad#0205: I am making a dice game. A little on the nose but it is what I though of and now I don't have time to change it haha
 StarKiller11342#5405: Hey guys
 Delphine Noel#1196: yo let's gooo
 thesola10#8080: "What is a game made of? What could I make into a gimmick?" Instead of starting with the idea of dice, try to stumble upon it
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: scROLLing
 GodOfPro#7302: Do you guys think putting a drill beat or something for the background music a good idea lol
 Acu1000#5560: I think there's a moderator watching us
 thesola10#8080: Look away from the game jam's idea itself, and pick apart the concept of a game. Then the jam theme might naturally set into it
 smearyto#3143: Good night to those who have to sleep
 Scolon#4218: I am 22 commits in
 Acu1000#5560: go in  , people are sharing ideas there
 SkinnerSpace#8418: Just don't know what I have to do right now. Keep looking at the ceiling till the morning in hope that I somehow will get an idea for a game, or go to sleep and feel guilty for not even starting working on a project :/
 smearyto#3143: I have only art of the title screen and dice🥲
 (유)니티 좋음/나찰 니티#7281: my tip is to jot down random ideas, cross some out and mash those into a complete game
 ThatsANiceHat#5774: Lots of good inspo in  !
 mtoon#8128: Yeah that will be good
 Arfilish#8729: i can't think of an idea
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Welp i'll be heading out. I'll see yall tommorow! (when my work will have reached my dms XD Gotta love playtesting)
 L3mmy♡#2307: Yeah, good luck to you!
 silver#2555: I almost managed to fail basic addition maybe I should go to bed
 ILOST#2645: I am making a top down shooter where your bullets are a deck of cards
 Dabt#7840: i might make a game about taking risks more than trying to use dice or random cubes with numbers or effects on them
 mtoon#8128: That can be ability like double jump or environnement change like spawn a jump pad
 bug#4987: good theme
 Kapuche#0144: thx for the tip !
 Freast#9278: Oh the jam started lmao
 Acu1000#5560: can we honestly get a #game-jam-idea-help channel
 SLiV#5820: Oh boy, I think I'm about to switch game engines! I was planning on using WASM4 but the 160x160 screen limit is a little bit too stifling for the idea I have, so I'm going to switch to Godot. Luckily I've only being coding for 2 hours...
 mtoon#8128: I can’t participate so i gave m’y idea :
A game where you roll a dice and depend of the face you have it will do something diferent
 Dragonbound#0999: [Reposting this in ]
 GigaByte#0652: help lol been thinking for so long and I can't get an idea 😦
 Chazi b#4006: I think I finally have an idea, getting excited now
 jb_Labs#5289: You need to be able to download it as a file that can run on the browser and be uploaded to itch.io. Otherwise, there's a risk that developers could keep working on their game after the closing time if they upload a link to the file.
Maybe you can find something for yourself. Good luck!
 Kapuche#0144: I'll prob go with throwing a "throw a dice, get a random power", but in another way. Since I want to train coding, I'll try implement that first. For the rest, an infiltration game
 L3mmy♡#2307: Fun is more important than progress!
I'm doing alright, got some art done, I just need full approval before making more !
 Soup#3034: i made a great tileset, and then a terrible character
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I'm currently in full relaxing, not expecting people needing playtesting rn, probs when I'm asleep so it's for tommorow. Wbu?
 (유)니티 좋음/나찰 니티#7281: Having fun not having progres...
 NalaFala38290#9305: I think I have a good idea now
 Giga chad#0085: Bro I swear time is hacking rn
 BlenderStudent#4251: I can heavily relate with this
 L3mmy♡#2307: Are y'all having fun ? I came to check up ^w^
 The Dream#2457: got me thinking of a platformer where different buffs/debuffs are applied to the protag at some interval, determined by roll of a die
 [killcode3.0]#6580: binge through Brackey's coding and unity tutorials
 Decycle#9999: I had an idea where I'll make a simulator game, where you control your colony to gather food/reproduce, etc, and every minute there will be a dice roll and something random happens
 Wames#8409: Not a bad idea thanks
 thesola10#8080: Hit me
 Magnet#2255: Could do a game of Blackjack where you roll a custom die
 Kapuche#0144: I got the idea, I got the gameplay ideas, I got EVERYTHING... I don't know how to code
 Occelot Dan#3777: Those who are struggling with the theme, you could try listing out common game mechanics that do act as dice rolls, and see if letting players influence those normally randomized mechanics leads to something fun
 [killcode3.0]#6580: you can visualize the random numbers by having an animated dice on the UI
 mtoon#8128: Do a dice with a lot of face
 Captain Poontang#0601: just make a dice function that you input how many sides you want per dice/per action 😄 A truly random game 😄
 (유)니티 좋음/나찰 니티#7281: Good, no fine,, no okay, no not so good
 yumaikas#3530: You could also use dice to select the temporary difficulty of another type of game, like an action game
 Wames#8409: My best idea has to do with random numbers. No dice. Don't know if it counts
 Acu1000#5560: doesn't have to be a board game, there's a plenty of uses. Card games, platformers, puzzle games, roguelikes...
 BlenderStudent#4251: Guys hows the jam going on
 bbrainstormer#9101: I had a somewhat similar idea: you have to cheat at craps without getting caught, but i don't even know how to play craps
 [killcode3.0]#6580: i thought past jams had boring themes, I like this one
 RapidRaid#8870: me. I am sitting here for like 2 hours and can't seem to find a game idea that would be fun to play. Maybe that is because I personally dislike dice / boardgames...
 CSharp#4989: I will say what I want to accomplish might be a lil tricky for me...kinda wish this was a 3day jam instead
 mtoon#8128: Sry no native english + Thanks
 Michel#2879: this year's theme is cool tho
 Wames#8409: Good to know! Good luck on the jame!
 Dabt#7840: i have nothing done
 Acu1000#5560: doesn't have to*
 Mr. KitKat#9415: this theme honestly slaps
 CSharp#4989: quite the opposite on my end; I like this theme but havent been a fan of past ones
 mtoon#8128: Tips : face of the dice doesn't have to be a number
 [killcode3.0]#6580: i had an idea where you could cheat the dice (by painting dots on it) to get what you want, but you have to avoid getting caught
but i gave up on it, because I did't know how to make an AI that can identify changes in dots and catch you
 ALittleRandomDude23#5867: im making kind of a mix of this and a tactical game
 Davgoxd#1219: Yeahhh
 GigaByte#0652: me
 bbrainstormer#9101: I kind of want to, but idk how to get procedural generation working in 50 hours
 Wames#8409: how many here are wishing the theme was different?
 Acu1000#5560: How many here are making a puzzle game?
 NitramiuZ#4145: How many here are making a rougelike?
 kcorb#6614: I had slay the spire stuck in my head for like an hour before I could think away from it, such a fun type of game to make though
 Davgoxd#1219: Fuck this theme is so hard
 Msipp#6059: you wanna hear some of mine? dm me i had like 3 bad ones you can steal idc at all
 kotadinmala#6222: i am making a  card game where the dice dictates the amount of cards drawn and it can be modified like energy in slay the spire
 lilburlap#8480: Yeah it was the first Idea so It's the one that everyone has
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: *sits back totally relaxed*
 Decycle#9999: that's exactly the idea I used to have
 Msipp#6059: so i've wasted my time coding useless garbage and i just came up with something
 GigaByte#0652: Anyone have ideas for a game?
 LM#4371: am I allowed to share my idea of a game to public or not?
 TheCanMan#4082: Trying to get an idea that fits a small scope is tricky as heck
 Chazi b#4006: My philosophy is that it's better to have a good, well thought-out plan at the end of day 1 than to have done a lot of work on one your not happy with
 Tustin2121#6219: Push your game state into a linked list and all changes to game state are just interpolation between two states, so moving forward in the game is the same code as moving backwards, because it's all just moving between fixed states of the board? (Maybe that's too high level for an explanation...)
 FGS#7735: Anyone else doing a roguelike (me and my friend are and have a decent idea)
 kcorb#6614: You can always make a demo
 lilburlap#8480: I have the idea for the player character is a die and the side that they land on is how many grid spaces they can move. that's it
 wren#0640: this is genuinely the quickest progress ive made in a jam i think tbh
 Msipp#6059: i've done sstuff and then i realized it was too difficult to implement in the short timeframe we have
 Decycle#9999: can we make a "sequel" of an existing game?
 Boiman Prime#7677: We've been brainstorming and ironing out ideas for like 3 hours so for anyone who feels bad about not doing anything yet, don't lol
 The Dream#2457: That makes sense, adds to the difficulty too if you have just a limited number of undos
 Msipp#6059: i hate this theme SO much you have no idea how hard it is to make anything to do with dice this sucks so much why couldn't it be ANYTHING else it's so hard to code anything ahhhhhhhhhhhhh there's 10000 ideas and none that will be possible whyyyyyyyyy
 lilburlap#8480: According to mark, a lot of people do
 Acu1000#5560: I did but gave up after 10 seconds
 wren#0640: i might honestly do it where i only log the last movement? so you only get one undo per movement. kinda sucks but its better than nothing
 MassedUp#8420: same here man
 [killcode3.0]#6580: anyone else already had a pre-conceived concept in mind and is now racking their minds on how they can modify it to fit the theme?
 BlahBlahBlue#4023: I can't even start until i'm out of college 8(
 SkyBrave#1435: my brain is just frozen rn, couldn't think anything
 Fox#3756: I have embarked upon a game idea that will almost certainly be more complex than I can manage in 48 hours, but I might as well roll the dice (pun intended).
 Chazi b#4006: Same! But now I think I want to scrap my current idea
 kcorb#6614: Probably more than 50% of applicants so good job !
 The Dream#2457: depending on how your implementation is, maybe keep the game state as a limited size queue?
 Msipp#6059: i've wasted 3 hours
 Michel#2879: it adds support to jetbrains text editor
you can dm me if u want to ask about other libraries
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I hope everyone's project is going great. I got a bit more relax time, work will find my ways into dm's while i'm asleep to do tommorow
 wren#0640: god i really wanna add an undo system to my game bc that makes sokoban games way more fun but that would be such a pain to implement
 Michel#2879: yes 
just create a file called index.html
and add this to it
 Click here 
 ILOST#2645: it's been 3 hours and all I have been able to create so far is a moving character
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: hello!
 Occelot Dan#3777: Heck yeah, nice work! Def don't forget to take breaks even when you've hit a good stride, burnout is real and can be *brutal* if it sneaks up on ya
 Taccos#1054: what does jetbrains do?
 DaforLynx#0296: Hot take: level design is just as important as mechanics design. Of course, you can't design levels until you know your mechanics, but it takes good levels to show off your mechanics in their best light.
Another viewpoint is that level design is part of mechanics design.
 Michel#2879: idk if you arent using visual Studio for example delete the vs support library. If ur game has no physics delete 3d and 2d physics etc.
 mtoon#8128: Make a html file that redirect you to your game
 The Dream#2457: Gotcha thank all!
 Taccos#1054: can you give me an example of unnecessary libraries?
idk what most of them do and their description is vague
 Acu1000#5560: just be creative
 Shinon#6104: Nope, themes are open for interpretation.
 DaforLynx#0296: I think that sort of wordplay is clever and should be allowable
 Tustin2121#6219: It can be interpreted however you want
 BuhPoi#9334: theme can be interpreted in any way
 The Dream#2457: Anyone know if the text is meant to be taken literally, i.e. "roll" vs "role" of the dice?
 Scolon#4218: I am also working at an extremely fast pace, never knew I could be this productive
 Shinon#6104: Drawing a blank for the game idea, so Imma sleep and reattempt it tomorrow.
 NoelJasik#8768: There was a site/tool that makes .exe of a scratch game, you can upload that
 Gurki#9176: can put it into a resource, or make it a singleton (look it up, its easy to do)
 MrBen#0001: man I already did 4 levels. I need to stop
 quickpocket#2838: Seems like if people have submitted games via scratch before then it would be allowed, but it’s unclear! (Hence why I’m asking here, thanks for the opinions folks). It was allowed during the global game jam but obviously that had different rules, and having judging does make a difference 🤷‍♂️
 spagoogi#5559: dude warn me next time you say something like that, im gonna barf
 Michel#2879: tank you
 Shinon#6104:  but in unity, you may use DontDestroyOnLoad function.
 NoelJasik#8768: Most crypto coins are a gamble, fits the theme perfectly mate, make a game where you have to bet on eth price
 Jasper#7906: you can probably upload an index with just an iframe to the engine to itch
 steeleater#7580: yeah i don't think you can make a game in that
 (유)니티 좋음/나찰 니티#7281: It's my first gmtk game jam too! Don't stress out, you can do this
 Peewi#8572: Part of the requirement to be on itch is that it'll lock your game during judging. If you have it hosted somewhere else, there's nothing stopping you from changing it.
 DaforLynx#0296: Nice. It always seems like there's *too* many of us, until a big game jam happens, at which point it's apparent there might be more game devs than there are game composers...
 Michel#2879: nah my current idea is genius tbh. But it's kinda anxious cus it's my first jam.
Also how to pass a variable between scenes
 spagoogi#5559: I'm assuming that you *could* do that, as people have submitted games in scratch before, after all, but if you could it would be nice to have something on itch itself
 kcorb#6614: Not sure where to fit in blockchain tech and machine learning :/
 NoelJasik#8768: The game needs to be on itch.io, so you can submit it, and so you can't edit post submission, what engine it's? there might be a way to make a .exe
 steeleater#7580: i don't think so, you should upload it to itch just to be safe
 (유)니티 좋음/나찰 니티#7281: I mean there's still enough time to scrap your whole game and make new one, If you need any help with unity tech stuff, just dm me
 krisis in a jar#0904: I GOT A MUSICIAN!!!!! FINALLY!
 Occelot Dan#3777: Congrats! With a solid but simple foundation like that, you can take the remaining time looking for ways to build on that foundation.
 quickpocket#2838: Hey folks! I’m wondering if we’re allowed to use a web based engine that doesn’t result in an upload to itch.io? It seems like the rules say you have to upload the game files to itch.io but it also says you can use any engine as long as you can play it in a windows browser. It’s unclear if the first part is just saying we need to put the game on itch.io to be accessible or not! If I don’t get a response I guess I’ll just use my best judgement that it’s okay to do so.
 Hobusu#5033: Also a reminder that there's a pinned message in this channel which shows when the submission deadline is
 Scolon#4218: I know I also have the entirety of tomorrow to develop the game, but I really want my entire game coded by the end of today
So I can spend all of tomorrow working on polish and art
 Michel#2879: don't stress us more😂
 Soup#3034: i was working so hard on the graphics for my game and then i realized i dont even have a working prototype
 Hobusu#5033: Countdowns in , please!
 NoelJasik#8768: Why i can't find anyone sitting in VC on any game dev discords during a major jam, for me it's a tradition to spend the whole jam in a vc with strangers
 steeleater#7580: if someone already had the idea of an isometric puzzle game where you control a dice by flipping it and the side it lands on is how many spaces forward you move tell me now so i can scrap that
 Lynxor#8232: Did one all ready implement something like different probability curves of the dice as jump/flying curves? A d20 a higher shorter one and a d4 a more flattened out one?
 (유)니티 좋음/나찰 니티#7281: You guys have 1 day, 22 hours, 57 minutes, 59 seconds to make a game.
 The Dream#2457: glad someone else is too
 Jellogramming#4653: a music making program for simple songs
 Michel#2879: I am done of drawing assests, user interface and dice rolling. Am I doing well
 steeleater#7580: it's probably not too late to change my game entirely
 spagoogi#5559: a simple music-making software
 krisis in a jar#0904: damn
 MikeHazeJr#6582: That game was so fun
 ◈・ Altaꐟ#9999: i am trying to do movement anims for 3 hours and nothing work on my project i will kill myself
 DaforLynx#0296: Two people have mentioned bosca ceoil, could i get a description of what that is?
 bird uwu#4471: ive almost finished my game already LMAO its very simple
 Michel#2879: go to package manager and delete unnecessary libraries. This doesn't only make it faster but much smaller
My project got from 400 to 80 MB
also you can make a backup before deleting libraries
 Alicja#3407: i love this theme ill be honest. last years filled me with dread, this years has my head spinning with inspiration
 Taccos#1054: anyone knows why unity takes ages to compile code?
 Michel#2879: i think i will continue after people around me sleep so it's calm outside
 LordOfRage#8914: I've got an idea finally
 Peewi#8572: a dice rolling compute shader?
 WorkingJoe#4433: Something is wrong with me (I'm writing a compute shader)
 Hamezii#5472: I've been playing Dicey Dungeons lately and that's stuck in my head
 Indigu#6862: I'm not going to be participating since I'm still in the basics of learning game Dev but I'd say it's a good idea to steal that since most people are flocking to actual dice or rng even though mark said that is the obvious way to look at it
 Kaymarts#5623: I can't stop thinking about Dungeon Dice monsters from Yugioh...
 NiallCrabtree#2618: for sure! keeping it so they can have an input on that as well is awesome
 SkyBrave#1435: joined.
 Mr. KitKat#9415: that's pretty smart!
 Kamigaru#7468: If anyone struggling to come up with an idea, here's a trick. Think of a game you like and the features it has. Then make a game around that feature using dice theme. For example, portal but the portal are two dice sides represent teleport spots. Or factory style game where you transport good but dice side represent the quantity load that is manageable.
 bbrainstormer#9101: The theme feels too specific
 kcorb#6614: Beat box into the mic, and add some effects and distort. Then loop.
 ratata#1252: bruh i have exam coming monday
 LordOfRage#8914: join the club
 GavRaz#6261: ive thought of something almost immediately
 Taccos#1054: i already have an idea
 JJfriends#3686: THIS SUCKS I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING IMA CRY ONG
 bbrainstormer#9101: Me either
 Jellogramming#4653: using my little music theory knowledge and bosca ceoil
 SomeTingOdd#8346: I still cant think of an idea :(
 (유)니티 좋음/나찰 니티#7281: I made random dungeon generation, player movement, and currently making gun system
 PokeNinjaGuy#9592: literally hacking
 LordOfRage#8914: i wish i could create that fast
 Giga chad#0085: Time to eat for the first time in 5 hours, ***some nice hot noodles***
 Z2D#3320: ok
 eth778#4517: I have a guitar that I'm just going to hit until something sounds good
 yakku#6969: randomly placing notes in bosca ceoil
 Jellogramming#4653: how it's been like 3 hours
 Crafter_04#4192: I will deal with that problem when i get there...
 Indigu#6862: The game is either just bean or square
 Z2D#3320: ...how
 Redline#7370: anyways good night imma go to slep and good luck on your games
 MrRedShark77#2280: i going to make web-based game xdxdxd
 Jasper#7906: (also, I don't actually intend for my dice to have numbers on their faces, I just started with that because it's simple)
 Tentras#3391: Is it too late to start with the game jam. Did you have to aply anywhere?
 DaforLynx#0296: Wondering...folks without practiced composers, how are you doing music?
 Indigu#6862: I can't think of any creative ideas for this other than the dice in cutting food
 eth778#4517: don't feel bad that's exactly what I'm doing
 Bankio is 👑#0754: Ive made 5 levels for my game and some dialogue
 Pyth0n#0572: my dice wont even have numbers in them!
 AzE#0001: I just need levels and sound now
 LordOfRage#8914: still a good start keep up the good work
 Occelot Dan#3777: Hey, that means you've build enough for a bug to happen! That's progress right there! 🐞
 GavRaz#6261: definitely didnt take like 3 hours to do one thing
 Redline#7370: f
 Z2D#3320: i've only made the player move
 Jasper#7906: my dice are just 2d squares with rounded corners and a number in them. Rolling is just the number changing...
 spagoogi#5559: hey, it's been, like, three full hours. that must be a new record.
 Crafter_04#4192: i just had my sixt bug...
And it fixed itself with another bug...
 LordOfRage#8914: hah! I don't even have an idea yet
 Occelot Dan#3777: I love the randomized enemy idea, I think giving players a heads up/way to react to the randomized elements helps keep it from being frustrating!
 yakku#6969: **its just a burning memory starts playing**
 Redline#7370: hah! I don't even have a dice yet
 (유)니티 좋음/나찰 니티#7281: Same
 Scolon#4218: Oh no I've just ran into my first bug 💀
 Jasper#7906: I've got a white page with white dice, which you can roll (either all of your own dice, or all of the opponent's dice). I guess that's progress...
 spagoogi#5559: my protagonist is a rat with magical dice, but I have no idea what they should actually fight. My only ideas are cheese, robots, and cheese robots. I will figure that part out later
 Pyth0n#0572: aight boys im making spleunky 3
 VanCastar#5425: I've only rolled some ideas in my head while walking the dog with a friend... maybe a Shmup or a TRPG...
 Taccos#1054: game jam progress going nicely so far. making the gun system now
 SlamBamActionman#7160: All I'm thinking of atm is the D&D practice of rolling dice to generate a random map, where different dice corresponds to different landmarks. Wonder if one could use that somehow...
 AndrewAllbright#6328: Anyone here have experience writing a behavior tree implementation?
 Bankio is 👑#0754: W thats a amazing engine  i wonder if they make a ddevelop 6
 PlatosMan#2789: Me too buddy... Me too...
 (유)니티 좋음/나찰 니티#7281: Yeah, totally, Mark said to "Think outside the box"
 MangoPango#6533: bad :)
 Redline#7370: going to sleep but nicely
 VanCastar#5425: GDevelop
 Galactum#6235: how's progress coming along for you guys? personally I'm pretty stoked with what I managed to accomplish in 3 hours
 Bankio is 👑#0754: Aw man i dont know unity, i use scratch 🥵🥵🥵😰😰
 Occelot Dan#3777: Super good point. Would also encourage folks struggling to make "randomness" a fun mechanic to think of other interpretations of the phrase "rolling the dice," such as "taking a risk for a higher reward" or something like that!
 Sheep777#3876: unity and urp
 Bankio is 👑#0754: What engine do u use
 NalaFala38290#9305: I still need an idea
 Sheep777#3876: Help, I imported a Dice sprite sheet and they are apearing black
 Jasper#7906: I ended up going plain old html+js so far. It's what I know, and it fit my game idea pretty well. Maybe I'll add more of a visual library later on, but I might not.
 MinccinoLuna#0662: you could have a die that has multiple of the same result on different sides
 Bankio is 👑#0754: IF SOMEONE NEEDS A GAME IDEA I GOT ONE! You have a dice and every level you beat u get to spin it. Whatever it lands on is the level you play after you bear them all theres a twist maybe like a die that has 20 sides.
 (유)니티 좋음/나찰 니티#7281: Tip for brainstorming, don't think dice as core mechanic, think of it as helping hand.
 NiallCrabtree#2618: Enemy types was an idea we had. Kinda like a rouge like but you can see the random generation before going into a room. Maybe you can pay resources to change it.
Another idea was making a maths game where you place two dice inbetween a symbol to unlock a door, but that is very similar to one last years top 20
 DarraghMcL#4569: I was actually thinking the slice/dice connection earlier
 LordOfRage#8914: maybe you could make a platformer where you are a dice and you can only roll
 Balrajjjjjj#8760: management just sound super shitty turns me off
 LambdaPyro#6782: I have a joke for all of you, I was "prepared" for the game jam
 wumpus#3512: imo its good practice though, also gives people a heads up its a gamejam game, and gonna be buggy
 PlatosMan#2789: The problem is it's super hard to make dice rolls fun. I'm trying to think of something where you get 6 different outcomes from your dice rolls but nothing comes to mind that's even remotely unique or interesting
 EnergyDashClarko#4158: construct 2
 Bankio is 👑#0754: Same ive just started and my game looks so bad probably cause i use scratch
 piginatuxedo#6179: Ayo what
 Beeg scarf#3571: nope
 Pyth0n#0572: im using python's pygame library
 skonn dinasir#9002: i was thinking of the idea of having a dice roll chose what move you do like whether you jump or move or attack or something but it sounds really bad so i wouldnt suggest doing it
 LordOfRage#8914: no you don't
 Balrajjjjjj#8760: "In an interview, Unity CEO John Riccitiello has said that developers who do not monetise their products early are "fucking idiots" etc etc
 100th_Coin#4059: Never done GMTK jam before. do I *need* the branding / GMTK logos in my game somewhere? I see there's and entire tab for getting that stuff on the itch page.
 yakku#6969: unity's merge with IronSource
 Tapu#9161: Noob at Godot so I'm gonna use javascript and a graphics library called p5js
 (유)니티 좋음/나찰 니티#7281: And don't watch devlogs by really skilled programmers and think you are so bad at it
 Bankio is 👑#0754: I use scratch 🥵🥵🥵🥵
 MinccinoLuna#0662: godot
 Pyth0n#0572: everybody gansta till the d4 spawns
 piginatuxedo#6179: recent headlines?
 DerpiestDude#2247: unity
 NiallCrabtree#2618: UE5!
 dardasaba#9759: Godot
 p3u#6651: il y en a!!!!
 CookiesRiot#2732: Trying to avoid coming up with the same thing everybody else is thinking of. So I'm actively omitting rng from my game and using another interpretation of dice...
But I'd be lying if I said I didn't have at least 4 games in mind that inspire the gameplay loop.
 LordOfRage#8914: Golden Rule for using Unity: if in doubt, watch a Brackeys video
 Balrajjjjjj#8760: unity but all the recent headlines got me reconsidering
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: Godot
 (유)니티 좋음/나찰 니티#7281: Unity
 Bankio is 👑#0754: What engine do you all use?
 PlatosMan#2789: I came up with that platform dissolve idea but couldn't get it to be fun
 skonn dinasir#9002: "wait so how do i use ui buttons again"
 Tapu#9161: Ideas are cheap so here's a free one:
Make a game where you stack different shape dies. If a die falls off you either lose a life or the game.
 Morg#8585: a game about cutting up die and then rolling other die into them in a weird game of hybrid bowling/domino just came to mind
 Pyth0n#0572: try limiting yourself to a game that could be played with dice irl, then port it to PC and polish it
 Hobusu#5033: If it's in DMs that's fine! Just use English within the server, please
 MrRedShark77#2280: hi
 p3u#6651: Don't quit!!! Last time I came with an idea only on the 2nd day, and I managed to deliver a game! Besides, still have no idea yet!!
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: i gonna dm in fench
 NiallCrabtree#2618: What i did is I separated all of the terminology in the theme "roll" "dice" "rolling dice" and then thought of different ideas. Maybe a platformer like super monkey ball where you are a dice? Maybe a platformer where dice are the platforms and the dice face is the amount of time before it disolves. Try and break it down as much as possible
 LordOfRage#8914: that's not much fun tho
 Bankio is 👑#0754: Hi everyone!
 CookiesRiot#2732: There's a board game I played last week called Call to Adventure which has runes to cast instead of dice. It's much more visual and tactile than dice, honestly. And it's easier to count binary runes than decode a jumble of base-6 dot glyphs.
 Pyth0n#0572: would game jamming be a performance, insight, or perception check?
 yakku#6969: think of an already existing game that kinda fits the theme and add a twist
 L3mmy♡#2307: If y'all are stressing over not having a team already, I managed to make a nice game within 2 days once!
 (유)니티 좋음/나찰 니티#7281: I just write random ideas, cross some out and mash remaining ones to one
 LordOfRage#8914: same here 😦
 Ahat#0842: i think for my dice characters they r gonna be able to rearange their sides to be their face
 SkinnerSpace#8418: I'm just wondering what are the methods people use to come up with new ideas? I'm still stuck because I mostly just write down random associations on paper and scroll pictures of dice on the internet.
 nightlings#5412: curse my schedule, hope i can join as an artist for the next jam lol
 L3mmy♡#2307: non /j
 Muffy#2153: I had an idea, but I'm starting to realize it's basically DnD and I'm reconsidering now 💀
 yakku#6969: hmm i like roger
 TheRayvenn#0001: why unity so hard
 Pyth0n#0572: if ur REALLY stuck you can just do a normal game where the avatar is a dice 😛
 (유)니티 좋음/나찰 니티#7281: Dicaur
 Cletus2000#0709: 🤔🤔  Design part is so interesting, i love jams
 PlatosMan#2789: Really struggling
 ramizali4#8657: Dicosaur
 joshe woshe#6343: dinaroo
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: any french here ? y'a des fr ici ?
 Roof#6985: I want to make a game where you play as a gambler with magic dice, a turn based game where you encounter enemies on a top down overworld. It will defs take inspiration from dicey dungeon though combat wise,
 bigblind#5722: I'm not gonna completely spoil the idea I'm tinkering with yet, but the title would be "Effing RNG!"
 NiallCrabtree#2618: An idea which we didnt pick was a game where you are in a dice tray and you have to match up dice to kill dice enemies in the tray. Dice become enemies if they arent used for a certain amount of time and they do as much damage that is on the top dice face
 Danny Dan Dan#6699: Ronald
 Vani079#5044: roger
 Scolon#4218: Got some basic UI up and running
 LordOfRage#8914: noooooooo don't give up i'm sure you'll do great
 yakku#6969: guys can you help me i cannot think of a name for my dinosaur
 8bbs#7547: Dice battler: you earn dice points by battling so you can by more value dice.
 DarraghMcL#4569: Asked my 3yo for ideas. I asked if he knew about rolling a dice. His reply was "Dominos..." I think he's onto something
 (유)니티 좋음/나찰 니티#7281: 1day 23hour 21minutes left
 Patrocinio#4174: Unfortunately I think I will quit the Jam. More than 2 hours and I couldn't think of any game idea. =/
 joshe woshe#6343: i made a game where every checkpoint the player(a dice) would set to a random number betweem 1-6 and each number would be a special ability
 NiallCrabtree#2618: oooo similar to ours, its also a tower defense game but with a unique twist with the use of dice 👀 going to be a lot of work for the programmers lol
 LordOfRage#8914: I am in need of an idea if you could help that would be great
 Fox#3756: I have a few weird ideas, but I'm struggling to find one that both sounds fun and sounds feasible for me to complete halfway decently in 48 hours.
 bigblind#5722: Sadly not, but images are useful too
 NalaFala38290#9305: no but codex can
 ramizali4#8657: us
 8bbs#7547: Can Dali 2 make games from a text prompt?
 Ahat#0842: lol
 Pyth0n#0572: i just created a variable called 'morbin'
 FryDev#0372: I’m really struggling with an idea
 LordOfRage#8914: I thought of an idea for a tower defence game where you have to roll a dice to determine the tower you can use, but I'm no good with tower defence
 NiallCrabtree#2618: are people still struggling with an idea, our team has just found ours finally
 SAFT_Morlol#2702: Starting with the logo is a quite unique way to start a Gamejam, but I let you aproach everything on your own way 😁
 nizbel#9979: I started making a game in which you are trapped inside a dice and has to tackle its sides to move in a board, but couldn't make it fun
 SkinnerSpace#8418: Probably I've got an idea. What if the six sides of a die represents 6 basic human emotions and your goal is to manage your mental state? Like you got a few "surprise" sides in a row and  now you have a heart attack or something, I don't know.
 NiallCrabtree#2618: First time booting up UE5 very spook
 yakku#6969: im making a 2d game about a cooking dinosaur
 DaforLynx#0296: ||an improvement,||
 bigblind#5722: Is there by any chance anyone with access to DALL-E 2 who'd be willing to request images with the prompt "Angry dice" or "evil dice" for me?
 wumpus#3512: making a 3d game was a mistake lmao
 ramizali4#8657: best😂
 (유)니티 좋음/나찰 니티#7281: Cool
 DarraghMcL#4569: Hi, I'm just getting started. Hows everyone doing?
 NalaFala38290#9305: same
 Ahat#0842: logo
 8bbs#7547: Plot idea: politics died, everything is up to dice.
 LordOfRage#8914: I am in desperate need of an idea
 JJfriends#3686: dang idk howim supposed to do movement
 Muffy#2153: I eventually remember lol, it's just the start when I overstress and overthink 😵‍💫
 Sheep777#3876: same
 yakku#6969: player movement,  simple camera and i **think** a solid idea
 Pyth0n#0572: PSA: going for a run does WONDERS for your burnout
 Lukey#6052: Just got back from getting water, I've got an idea down and some sprites but zero code yet because I'm still not sure how to implement it :D
 Onomi#7378: ok new idea, roll the dice and if it lands on a 6 you get fart sound effects with reverb
 Occelot Dan#3777: You got this!! The folks in  are always willing to help if you have specific questions or roadblocks
 LordOfRage#8914: i literally have no idea lol
 Muffy#2153: Seriously, I'm like "wait, how do I declare a variable again?"
 SAFT_Morlol#2702: How far is everyone?
 yakku#6969: i feel like i know everything but im overwhelmed and dont know what to do
 Cletus2000#0709: The 2D representation of the dice makes me wanna go 3D, in 3d i dont have any clue on how to make the control feel nice but it would be more interesting for sure, thx for advice
 FryDev#0372: I think I have an idea blockup in my brain
 GameDude#3494: Already got a game going, but I might get overwhelmed because of all the mechanics I wanted to add.
 Muffy#2153: God every time I start a new jam I feel like I forget **everything** I thought I knew
 Balrajjjjjj#8760: ah ok that might be what I missed, ty!
 (유)니티 좋음/나찰 니티#7281: I spent 2 hours making complete dungeon generation, player movement and just finished drawing sprites.
 8bbs#7547: Pen and paper are your friend at this point in time. Flush it out before you even boot up your Mac / pc / whatever
 Lukey#6052: Hoooo I'm feeling a little strange in the stomach, gonna grab that water I was talking about earlier.
 Ceding Tree#1081: More ideas: Dice that have missing faces and you have to unlock those faces in some way
 ZedDev#4726: I had to install a specific version of Omnisharp from GitHub, but it fixed itself the next update
 ChipmunkDev#1808: just spent two hours making a useless collision system from scratch 😄
 Balrajjjjjj#8760: did you have to do anything specific? I'm just going with Visual Studio for now but would rather use VSCode in general
 Ridley#0760: 😄
 Ceding Tree#1081: Another prompt: Two dice become seperated and must do "something" to be reunited (use your imagination). While seperated the individual "die" becomes weaker in some way
 ZedDev#4726: I'm lucky then, only had one issue that i managed to fix
 lizard#8211: thanks for the responses guys. I don't have any skill or ability to make games but I'm still interested this and want to participate in the ways that I can. I'd also be fine with testing games
 ZedDev#4726: Time to draw a dice
 Balrajjjjjj#8760: late but I just gave up on VSCode and installed Visual Studio, I couldn't get autocomplete working in the former at all
 spagoogi#5559: the games will be found on the itch.io submission page!
 8bbs#7547: Scope creep is such a rabbit hole
 StellarNightmare#2275: Goodluck XD hopefully I can complete mine in time.
 Wolfye#1115: yay finally set the game idea ;D
 Viola_Buddy#6763: They'll be collected on the itch.io page once the submission period ends, I'm pretty sure.
 Ceding Tree#1081: Taking a quick break, so I will throw some prompts out there for anyone looking for ideas.
In the spirit world, time isn't worth much. With no fear of death or deadlines, the spirits spend their time gambling on the lives of the living.
 MonkeyLiu#8573: when you think of poker chip colors (red, blue, green, black) and if they were going to be enemy types, what order of difficulty should the chips go in? I was thinking red, green, blue, black
 CookiesRiot#2732: Valid. I'm already bending over backwards to minimize scope and still execute the basic premise I started with.
 JJfriends#3686: rice or ice
 quackhacker#0972: You can only *rate* games if you participate in jams, but anyone can usually play them.
 Darigan#0716: I'd love to see someone make a Dungeon Dice Masters (the yugioh spin-off)
 CSharp#4989: Ayo a Ridley PFP tho?
 Lavra source#3802: You can only play games if you participate as i remember
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: who is french pls
 Ridley#0760: ask what is fun about a dice roll and go from there
 lizard#8211: I'm not a game maker but I am a game player. I am assuming that the games will be available to play and we can find them from this discord when the game jam is over?
 JJfriends#3686: what
 Darigan#0716: Simple Idea: Breakout but with dice (where it breaks extra bricks according to faces on collision)
Complex Idea: Dialogue based game but with randomness to possible reactions.
 Mr House#1276: It's not that unrealistic, you can have a 3d environment with 2d weapon and character art, look at games like delver and paper mario
 (유)니티 좋음/나찰 니티#7281: I still have the link
 Jasper#7906: There's plenty you can do with dice without randomness. Some ideas I've read in this channel: your game takes place on a rolling die, dicing food, the character is die
 Ceding Tree#1081: What is sleep?
 dardasaba#9759: Just saw the theme, interesting
Sadly won't be able to start working on the game today
 LOPSTERu#3902: of course
 Viola_Buddy#6763: Check out GMTK's video on input vs output randomness! Someone in here was mentioning it earlier (and I'm sure it's super buried now), but that's a good way of figuring out how to involve randomness without it feeling out of the player's control
 StellarNightmare#2275: I'd rather have a game than over extend and not meet the deadline.
 (유)니티 좋음/나찰 니티#7281: Yup
 Occelot Dan#3777: Someone had a cool concept earlier about approaching "roll of the dice" not as randomness, but as being willing to take a risk. So maybe think of a concept that encourages players to take more risks than they normally would?
 The4thAD#7854: Id recommend thinking outside of the box and coming up with different interpretations. For example, “rolling the dice” doesnt necessarily mean throwing them down and getting a random result!
 ZedDev#4726: yes sadly
 yakku#6969: hell nah
 kotadinmala#6222: do you guys plan to sleep throughout the two days >
 Ceding Tree#1081: start with what you have, and work from there. the other ideas should start to follow!
 CookiesRiot#2732: For a 2-day jam, I'd rather have an interesting concept that's not polished than a stale concept that looks like a full release.
 ShaggyMuffin23#0326: i feel like i'm going crazy, i've spent hours thinking of an idea but i only have concepts, no actual game mechanics
i just don't think anything that's randomly chosen outside the character's control would be all that fun to play, and i can't think of anything else that would tie the theme into the game mechanics
 Viola_Buddy#6763: If anyone's still coming up with ideas based on the theme - check out the Wikipedia page on dice. You could go down the mathematical route with how many sides a die has, and fun with 3D shapes. You can also go down the route of history - early dice were knucklebones of animals and we suspect they were used for divination first before they were used for games. There's also the exploration of what even counts as dice - the Ancient Egyptian game of senet uses sticks, rather than anything we would recognize as a die today; and on the modern side of things, some commercial versions of the game of Pig (traditionally a dice game) use little figurines of pigs instead of dice, and you see how they land (snout-up vs feet-down, etc.).
 StellarNightmare#2275: Well Goodluck to you. Every simple game can be polished earlier than a complex one.
 Naemless#8596: your idea doesnt make much sense and is unrealistic for a 2 day jam
 CookiesRiot#2732: Mix the two creatively. Make some views in 2D and others 3D. Could be interesting. Maybe even tie that to the dice concept. Whatever represents your "roll of the dice" is in 3D but the core gameplay loop is in 2D, or vice versa?
 Scolon#4218: Anyways I got my inventory mechanics up and running and started working on my implementation of the dice mechanics
 bird uwu#4471: its a pretty basic game lol, i dont trust myself to be able to make a bigger game LMAO
 Anxeal#4160: I tried, it doesn't give a good answer
 Mr House#1276: Same I barely know how to code
 spagoogi#5559: i have an idea, and i have pizza. this is going very well. i should probably open unity soon.
 Occelot Dan#3777: That is such a good start tho!! This early, having any mechanics in place is killer!
 Ceding Tree#1081: For me, this is just a learning experience! If I can actually make something that works from start to finish I will be so proud of myself! It's taken me 2 hours but I put together an idea board, and 2 decent looking concepts for the major mechanics in my game! Good luck to all of you out there, and remember, work at your own pace and have fun!
 Jasper#7906: Got a first thing done. Time to git init!
 StellarNightmare#2275: My powers out so I have to wait to continue my game... 💀
 CookiesRiot#2732: I'm definitely out of my league here with my idea. Lol. I just made a 3D game for the first time ever and now I'm doing 2 kinds of 3D interchangeably.
 Scolon#4218: I really want to make an isometric game, but I don't think I'll have enough time to create all the art assets...
 bird uwu#4471: ok fun ive *kinda* got my game working but you cant lose and your score doesnt show
 kcorb#6614: Just ask a GPT-3 model
 Mr House#1276: Draft ideas while you're waiting
 Occelot Dan#3777:  could help if you haven't already checked there!
 Cletus2000#0709: Finally got my idea, but i dont even knoe if ill do it in 2d or 3d
 Alphons6#5054: Theme bad
 LethalChicken#3001: yay the project doesn't work at all now 🥰
 EnderShade#0424: I was thinking in an resource management game where the player chooses the result of all the dice rolls in a tabletop rpg campaign and must manage the enjoyment of all the "players", finish the "DM" planned story and take care of poorly balanced encounters
 Ell#3559: no better place to learn than a game jam, that's how i got started
 Ridley#0760: unity package install waiting room
 LethalChicken#3001: deleting the library folder will probably work so Imma try that
 Occelot Dan#3777: Hmm that makes sense. I do think the mini-game collection concept could be cool, but if you don't feel like you would enjoy the concept you have, I would encourage you to keep brainstorming. What if you took a genre you do like/feel comfortable with and tried to break that up into "mini-game" type experiences?
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: lol that would be torture
 (｡◕‿◕｡) Harmony <3#8571: i believe in u
 gabriel382#9118: didya look the package manager to see if the package is installed?
 Pixel#9717: dude I don't even know how to make a game
 Mr House#1276: Did you set your code editor to vis studio in unity preferences
 kcorb#6614: snake but you have to roll a dice to decide which way you turn
 Naemless#8596: anyone need an extra person on their team i can do programming i dont mind what game you are making please can i join someone
 LethalChicken#3001: right now the issue is that VSCode can't find the UnityEngine.InputSystem namespace
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: ads take up so much time when you're trying to follow a tutorial on YouTube
 bug#4987: that's why I decided on mine 10 minutes in
 gabriel382#9118: oh, me too🤣
 smearyto#3143: I use gdevelop lol
 (｡◕‿◕｡) Harmony <3#8571: okokokokoo
super monkey ball
but instead of a ball
its a dice
so its really bad at rolling lol
 6746#9763: have you ever had a moment where you're looking at every byte of the code then realize the issue isn't even with the code itself? i love game engines.
 Mr House#1276: We all are mate, that's just unity for ya
 LethalChicken#3001: no I mean I'm still fighting with unity packages
 Melwing#3159: I have... well, I have a 6-sided die that rolls "truly random". And a button that makes it roll. And some ideas. Mostly I'm going to have a nap, I think.
 kylejramstad#0205: I have some rolling dice with animations so far. I might actually finish.
 gabriel382#9118: The idea is the most important thing in a jam, so don't worry about spending a few hours thinking
 aedr#1997: ~~lmao just make any game but with a character with dice wheels and get away with anything you want cuz it technically fits “rolling dice”~~
 kcorb#6614: making dumb mouth noises > hiring a professional sound artist
 WhyIamHere#0329: me too
 LethalChicken#3001: an hour in and I still have nothing actually made
 coolhotdogguy#4788: Anyone know why intellisense/auto complete in Visual Studio Code will know things like Update and OnCollisionEnter but does not seem to know things like Input or transform
 Mr House#1276: My idea, and I'm not concerned if people steal it, is that you've got a mission to do, but every time you take an action you add to a meter, you have to pace yourself or you'll fill the meter and lose. No dice rolls or deterministic probability, just calculated risk taking.
 Melwing#3159: Ah yeah I think it would skirt the line, thank you I missed that.
 WhyIamHere#0329: platformer but you roll the dice to open doors and kill enemys
 aedr#1997: There’s prolly gonna be a small percentage of actual literal dice being the main mechanic
 Dylan Jones#9385: there’s a lot of people looking for musicians dam
 momaur#2107: "Please don’t make games about or based on Mark Brown, the GMTK brand, or any Jam mods - it’s easy for parody and inside jokes to go wrong. " am not sure if this falls into that
 mrCamelCase#2782: he puts it out there in half his videos nowadays, so i mean probably
 Ceding Tree#1081: not everyone
 NitramiuZ#4145: No it's not like that really, I think my problem is that this type of game isn't really what I like myself, so I it will be hard to make something good
 Zoro5168#0115: Idea is decided bois
 Dabt#7840: i see everyone is going for direct dice themes
 Unclouded#9240: i dont think he will be mad about it
 epicman#3996: platformer but you die at random times
 Occelot Dan#3777: What if you randomize a mechanic that we normally do not want to be random?
 Melwing#3159: So, legitimate question though it may sound like a joke haha. Is it okay to use Mark's likeness in the game? His actual face on a screen, or whatnot.
 WhyIamHere#0329: ia
 Occelot Dan#3777:  had a similar concept, maybe it's something the two of you could collab on?
 mrCamelCase#2782: obligatory "good luck, and have fun!" message, looking forward to seeing what everyone makes!
 quantum#0043: i hate blender
 The4thAD#7854: Yes. You can interpret the theme however you want. ~~ALSO NO BECAUSE THATS MY IDEA TOO-~~
 Unclouded#9240: go to art help if you want to find art people
 Super#7038: Same
 Yoaquin#5868: thanks
 ThatsANiceHat#5774: 2 player missile command + pong with short rounds where the die rolls - the top and bottom pips are your launchers and cities, side pips launch missiles
 Crafto#4284: is a dice who rotate for moving can be called a roll ?
 NitramiuZ#4145: I need advice, I have this very chill idea for a game, with many small minigames in it, but I'm scared it won't be fun enough and the fact that it is a art heavy game, not a programming heavy game, and programming is what I excel at. It would be interesting to try and make a pretty pixelart game but that could turn out ugly. It feels like I should abandon the idea but I don't have any other ones...
 KhashayarJan#4613: You mean a card?😁
 mista flåx#1321: Hello
 Yoaquin#5868: me too, im not thinking on making the game really deep in these stuff but id like to learn about it
 NalaFala38290#9305: what about a dice that isn't random
 WhyIamHere#0329: i am stuck at the dice and make it roll random
 Grizz#4422: Coding Train has a good video that came out recently
 Yoaquin#5868: not necessarily quantum mechanics, but some ideas are great, like entanglement and probabilities, for example platformer where you are at many places at the same time till you touch somehting
 aedr#1997: game where you’re a kid innocently playing snakes and ladders but the dice is actually taken from an ancient house with a graveyard below, and the game gets scarier the more you play
 WizfanZZ#7871: whats the video, id be interested for entertainment purposes
 Mr House#1276: Escape from a casino, there's nothing random but the enemy chasing you is a big dice
 yazlo#8078: wave function collapse algorithm for procedural generation
 JowelYudisi#4271: you could also try to explain quantum mechanics with dices™️
 WhyIamHere#0329: any ideas
 Aitesedbaن#6908: how do you make quantum mechanics a game though
 Tustin2121#6219: I have a recommendation for a really good video on Wave Function Collapse algorithms is anyone is looking to go that way for the randomness aspect.
 Mr House#1276: Yea it's about rolling the dice and getting all 6 results at once
 Yoaquin#5868: yeah, there are many ideas that fit the randomness and probabilistic theme
 BlackPenguin#4260:   hey we looking for a musician, we are two people bot 3d modelers and unity coders
 aedr#1997: ~~imagine sleeping during a game jam~~
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: sorry dude i was just joking :(
 IntangibleMatter#2281: I honestly have no idea what exactly to do with it so I'm basically gonna make Red Ball but with various dice
 Grizz#4422: Saw the theme and started trying to come up with ideas. Lots of people were saying they were gonna go to sleep then due to time-zones, that made me sleepy so now I am back lol
 Xion | Mr. X#0183: Thanks.
 Aitesedbaن#6908: non deterministic probability?
 StellarNightmare#2275: I got load shedding so can't work on my game for the next hour...
 Yoaquin#5868: has anyone thought about quantum mechanics?
 Hobusu#5033: Here or  is fine!
 ThatsANiceHat#5774: Where should I throw a pitch I wish I could make but don't have the time this year and would rather someone else cannibalizes it for ideas?
 JowelYudisi#4271: just put my name somewhere thanks
 Occelot Dan#3777: Hmmm I see... I'm no programmer either (just here to cheer folks on) but you can always check  to look for teammates! You could also look for a way to build towards telling a tiny part of an overarching story in each random mini game, but that could take some time to plan/build
 Lukey#6052: what if the dice rolls you BUT you ARE the dice :O
 aedr#1997: realistic ragdoll physics, 6 “people” with different physics correlated to each side of a dice
 Tustin2121#6219: You just sparked off about 30 more game jam ideas, lol
 StellarNightmare#2275: Dang...
 dap1as#0448: what if you get riced by the droll?
 raindancer#0953: this is getting interesting
 JowelYudisi#4271: what have I done
 Yellow768#6924: what if you dice the roll
 NalaFala38290#9305: what if the roll dices you
 spagoogi#5559: *my god...*
 dap1as#0448: "the dice rolls you" genius
 aedr#1997: I think this is similar to the previous theme “Out of Control”
 JowelYudisi#4271: what if the dice rolls you and as long as you stay alive you watch some dices rolling themselves just to see who rolls you next until you die
 derHinek#4425: I'm thinking about something similar: Dice as a weapon to throw and you attack the enemy with what you rolled.
 Wandere#8088: Games don't need a end for those asking, you can simply just make the a timer going down as you are playing, then make items in the game that may extend the timer - or just increase other variables such as speed so in the end it becomes virtually impossible to continue.
 quantum#0043: how can i add atmospheric fog in unity
 Mr House#1276: Yes and make it a dice dating sim
 Chrome#8194: I think that's a fun idea
 spagoogi#5559: stellar.
 NalaFala38290#9305: should I make a game called daisu-ki
 bbrainstormer#9101: Brilliant
 aedr#1997: what if ur the one controlling the dice and you try to be as unpredictable to the opponent as possible
 Beeg scarf#3571: There should be a game design help channel
 dap1as#0448: FREE GAME IDEA: on start, a dice is rolled. even number? you win. odd number? you lose.
 Barigamb#2319: I wish man, I wish
 Xion | Mr. X#0183: I'm not all that experience in programming so doing like that might take a minute. (Unless of course I get help.)
 smearyto#3143: You work with what youre given(thats how im doing it)
 ZackDragneel#2983: I was thinking of a top-down shooter where you throw you can either throw your dice as weapons, roll them for abilities or use them as platforms and such but I feel it needs refinement
 Occelot Dan#3777: OOOO I love this take, I've been so caught up in the concept of randomness, but this is a really cool approach
 spagoogi#5559: you're like. 1/3 of the way done
 Barigamb#2319: Finally finished my bloody player controller
 JowelYudisi#4271: You can do whatever you please with the theme as long as it's creative and somehow fits, so i think ur nice
 Occelot Dan#3777: Does the game have to have an end? What if it continues to speed up until you fail a certain # of times?
 Penguin#7600: what do you think about the theme? i feel like a dice is just a vessel for randomness, and i cant think of anything that isnt overly luck-based. are there any other ways to interpret it?
 who-is-Ellie#8917: lmao ik i'm doing a webGL build anyways, no point making people download it
 Mr House#1276: Anybody else taking this a bit more figurative? I'm looking to not have any dice, but thinking of "roll the dice" being more like "be risky, take chances"
 Hobusu#5033:
 Hobusu#5033: Submissions are due no later than , which is !
Remember that the last two hours are intended purely as a submission window , so __if you haven't submitted by then there will not be any opportunity for a late submission for any reason__. No exceptions, so make sure to submit your game well before the deadline!
 Lukey#6052: Ok lol I'm stressing out a little because I started late and I'm still not entirely sure how to implement my ideas but I'm still trying! I might grab some water soon (As should all of you).
 Mr House#1276: You have to make it for windows it's one of the xonditions
 Xion | Mr. X#0183: Here the bigger question, how do I end the game as a whole. Also thank you for re-enforcing that into my head. I do tend to get sidetrack with stuff like the it should be played.
 skeedin#5828: Gah! I shoulda started there! Thanks spagoogi!
 Jasper#7906: Didn't know it myself either, but google did 😎
 who-is-Ellie#8917: ;-; well ok then, I just won't make mine available for windows then. That's what they deserve for using such a crappy OS
 JowelYudisi#4271: i don't think so
 spagoogi#5559: go to the itch page!!
 KadDev#8100: Alright, because I was wondering which gamemaker subscription to buy, but since it doesn't HAVE to be on HTML5 i can just use the windows export
 dap1as#0448: mac users dont deserve to play the game
 Mernaxian#5120: is there any restriction on swearing or anything like that?
 skeedin#5828: Wait sorry for silly Q: what time are submissions due, and on which day?
 seshoumara#4386: ok, thanks
 kablouser#4232: morbin time but with dice
 K'miinik#3171: I'd still reccomend focusing on one of them, things take a lot more time than you expect most of the time
 Jasper#7906: yep
 spagoogi#5559: you game must be playable on windows, browser, or both. other builds are optional, but perhaps a mac build would be nice too if you're doing download-only. (web is fine)
 JowelYudisi#4271: Hi everyone! Best of luck, hope everyone has fun ^^
 Kertox#3429: God Damned Dice
 dap1as#0448: you can submit more than one game
 Pyth0n#0572: i nearly thought i deleted my code 😅
 Magnet#2255: Ah. I'm very much 'just' the self-taught artist for my two-person team, no schooling in game design
 Occelot Dan#3777: If you're thinking in a "warioware" type of direction, I would encourage you to avoid getting super hung up on the specifics of every single mini-game. The mini games themselves can be super simple, it's the sudden shift in mechanics that presents the fun/challenge
 seshoumara#4386: Got 2 super simple ideas. Can I do both for this jam?
 K'miinik#3171: i have zero intention to make art for this jam, despite being capable, just because of time
 DaforLynx#0296: God damn dagnabbit
 KadDev#8100: np XD
 Jasper#7906: Game Design Document
 HopeMetal#0586: mine's 4 lines long
 KimTheMightyChim#0685: yes sorry xD
 Magnet#2255: GDD?
 sokry#2862: hi
 who-is-Ellie#8917: just started haha (solo tho :p I just like GDDs they help me keep things in scope)
 SlingingPlant145#5532: I'm working in a team, so that probably wouldn't be a good idea. Lol
 K'miinik#3171: not bad at all, but look for free sprites firs
 Squiggles#2157: how bad is it if i just use paid sprites, i have zero artistic value in my body lol
 Scolon#4218: Almost done with my core mechanics, just a few more things to do
 KimTheMightyChim#0685: it doesnt have to be a literal dice xD
 Minus#1843: GDD? YOLO IT xD
 KadDev#8100: on windows?
 lluuddvv#8632: I sadly can't compete
 FéliXD#4922: Can I make more than 1 game?
 Speg#9708: will there be a rating based on how fitting the game is to the theme? I hope not since the goal is to get creative and some people might think we go too far 💀
 imortalicecream#4718: i have 0 rng my game is a puzzle game
 K'miinik#3171: do whatever, the theme isn't legally binding
 Skulls#6728: Do we need to see the dice rolls or just a Mathf.Random is enough? xD
 Soup#3034: i got it working
 Chrome#8194: I couldn't think of a fun way to add randomness so my mind went to using the dice themselves as a weapon
 SlingingPlant145#5532: Who's still working on their GDD? 😦
 KimTheMightyChim#0685: not reqlly just so;ething plqyqble on zindozs
 Minus#1843: Nice, for me I made jumping character 😅
 MollyFnly#0369: i had a variation on this idea that i dont think ill be able to do where youre a tiny man on a giant craps table and there are dice and poker chips being thrown at you
 Snory#4231: I just found out that roll of the dice is same as "take a chance" 🙂
 The4thAD#7854: I have an idea for a stealth game where you need to “roll” the dice layout to block the view of a wandering character and an enemy
 KadDev#8100: do we have to submit in HTML5?
 imortalicecream#4718: i have succesfully made dice and hand art
 Ber#3410: that is an odd idea lol
 Tustin2121#6219: The package manager makes it difficult to install? I really like the package manager, you just click "download" and "install" or whatever and it just imports it for you...?
 Soup#3034: theres an unlock button but it doesnt work
 MollyFnly#0369: ironic name tbh
 KonguTORTELLINI#4162: come on brainstormer, you can do it
 bbrainstormer#9101: I can't come up with any ideas :/
 8-Bit duck#4223: oh huh
 Soup#3034: unity locks it in the package manager so its rly difficult to install now, and they did this after brackeys stopped making videos
 VanCastar#5425: Hm GDevelop is getting some fire up tonight... I got a few ideas already...
 L3mmy♡#2307: Y'all remember to take care too!
 8-Bit duck#4223: theres a good brackeys tutorial on it
 Chrome#8194: Ooooo I like that, thank you
 Soup#3034: how do you unlock the 2d tilemap editor in unity??
 Tustin2121#6219: The dice are enchanted so that depending on the roll that comes up it hits the enemy with certain attacks. Roll a 6 for lightning strike, etc.
 Govand#8272: Remember for int it is `Random.Range(min int inclusive, max int exclusive);`
but ------for float it is `Random.Range;`
 quantum#0043: i literally cant get a name for the game
 Chrome#8194: Really? thank you, I think I'll just go for it
 spagoogi#5559: my if not best but most complete idea is that you are a rat who found a set of magical dice. you barf the dice at enemies and magic happens. you collect their dice sometimes. it is called dicebarf. wow i am so cool
 Occelot Dan#3777: I do love the "swapping die to determine difficulty" concept, but that may be tough to implement in the jam alone. I would get a set of random effects working first, and build off of that if you still have time
 Xion | Mr. X#0183: Yeah
 Albertalberto#1865: I think the concept of throwing dice at your enemies is already quite fun lol, you've got a nice start I think
 L3mmy♡#2307: no u
 Mitrano#1874: Have fun everyone
 (｡◕‿◕｡) Harmony <3#8571: im making dicey dungeons 2
 Jasper#7906: I can't think of anything that doesn't make that fun...
 Agentlion#1893: of course!
 MagiGuy789#4139: Had an idea for a puzzle platformer where, every time you get hit, your dice character flips to a new number with a different set of tools. The changing wouldn't be random.
 Mr.HOPE#7536: Dice IS the player
 Chrome#8194: I was thinking of some game where you participate in gladiatorial combat and fight by throwing dice at people, but I can't think of anything that would actually make that fun
 quantum#0043: getting the basics done
 FéliXD#4922: I want
 Nemario#7382: Yep
 Zayed#7379: Yep, it's just that it gives same 1/3 chance
 GAMERNINJASK#1503: does someone want to hear my idea for a game?
 DerpiestDude#2247: did you put in any parameters ``Random.Range(minimum, maximum)``?
 Beardules#6108: Oooh i like that!
 (｡◕‿◕｡) Harmony <3#8571: rolling........... *dice*???????!?
 Unclouded#9240: yes
 Xion | Mr. X#0183: lol.
 Ber#3410: i hate not being able to understand what people say sometimes 😭
i really need to learn unity
 Lukey#6052: Ok I might just make a board game (an interesting one), I know a lot of people will be doing that which means I'll have some massive competition but I believe in myself.
 Albertalberto#1865: Already slightly stressed out lol. Have clear idea, building a movement prototype right now. Programming is my biggest fear at the moment, I think I have a clear art and sound direction in mind at least
 Zayed#7379: It gives the same number 4 times for some reason
 Occelot Dan#3777: That def has potential! So the fun/challenge comes from being dropped into a new mini game and finding out how it works?
 vide0gamer#5404: i joined this last minute so, really, depending on how you feel
 DerpiestDude#2247: unity has ``Random.Range();`` for rng which is what I'm using
 paulhdh#6428: finally getting started had to finish some stuff.
 (｡◕‿◕｡) Harmony <3#8571: roll of the dice eh? its like a dice that you roll
 Unclouded#9240: i mean geting teleported into a different level when the dice gets rolled in the level you are in
 GAMERNINJASK#1503: can we share ideas for our games?
 Ber#3410: idk
 Jasper#7906: every time he/she/other *dice* right 😉 😉
 Hollow#7269: I just found out about this happening a few minutes ago and i'm wondering if i should even try because i didn't plan the next two days around it aHHHH
 vide0gamer#5404: well the most progress i made on my game is figuring out how number generating works which, considering the theme might be the best progress ive made
 DerpiestDude#2247: np!
 joshe woshe#6343: yeah thx
 Xion | Mr. X#0183: Here's an idea: What if everytime the player dies (or open the game) they play a different minigame? Kind of like WarioWare/
 Beardules#6108: Thank you :) I may allow the player to "load" their dice before the game starts, with their desired modifiers. In a longer game, more modifiers could be unlocked.
 The_Charmeleon#5954: no like turn based like kinda crypt of the necro dancer
 L3mmy♡#2307: Everything going to plan so far ? Y'all have remembered to drink and take care of yourself too ?
 Agentlion#1893: This is going to be fun guys!
 Lukey#6052: Getting some ideas down, Unity finally opened. I'm liking the theme
 Occelot Dan#3777: I love this! Would definitely recommend testing ways to avoid the random negative effects from becoming frustrating. Maybe show what is about to happen and show a countdown?
 DerpiestDude#2247: double jump 👀
 happynessisgames#3531: been in a meeting for the past hour and am *very* bored lol
 who-is-Ellie#8917: thinking of ideas! :D (and eating cake! 👀 )
 Chowdog 宗翰#0135: lose health to deal huge damage around you
 joshe woshe#6343: it could work but i am not that smart to implement that
 MasterDan118#0542: surviving 🥲
 Beardules#6108: Not a bad idea. I thought the difficulty could come from picking a different dice. 6-sided (with only 6 fx) would be easier than, say, a 20-sided dice with 20 possible FX
 Jasper#7906: higher jump, faster move, wall jump, health regen, extra damage
 L3mmy♡#2307: Hows everyone doing ?
 Good K#8995: That must be some sort of a coincidence, but I just started developing a roguelike game about 2 weeks ago
 Tustin2121#6219: Stop time/super speed and X-ray vision
 Xion | Mr. X#0183: ?
 Ber#3410: like super hot?
 joshe woshe#6343: hey i need 2 random abilities anybody got ideas?(sadly there is no idea help channel lol)
 Lukey#6052: Ah, Unity finally decided to open. I think it's because I closed chrome so Unity had an acceptable amount of laptop-resources.
 Govand#8272: ++++
 SkyBrave#1435: +++
 Xion | Mr. X#0183: I'm kinda stump, I could use some someone to bounce ideas off of.
 Tustin2121#6219: Reminds me fondly of the game jam I attempted using Inkle's Ink language system... which I'm still working on about 2 years later... good times... (great language, btw)
 Hobusu#5033: Gotta make each post in there count!
 Morg#8585: im making a text adventure for the jam, and yeah they definitely do! but im excited to write it
 BadPiggy#5202: Oof. Maybe go with that then
 Unclouded#9240: maybe the dice could change the level
if you get 1 you get a really hard level
but if you get 6 you get a really easy level
 Ber#3410: i understand the slow mode but 14 minutes in the progress channel 💀
 The_Charmeleon#5954: what are those games called where when you move the enimyes move
 Jo the Astronaut#4418: maybe! who knows~ makes me think of those old choose your own adventure books where you pick a choice and go to that page. The only problem is that those stories get beefy reallllly quick
 Beardules#6108: As this is my first jam, I'm going simple...
2d platformer with a constantly-rolling dice in the corner. When the Dice picks a number, a modifier  is temporarily added to the the game.
Good stuff and bad stuff - temp invulnerability for the player, a load of enemies spawning, falling rocks, slow motion....
....disco mode....
 Jasper#7906: that reminds me of Story Cubes
 Winston#3957: happy to help 🎉
 Aquila#3385: hype theme
 Soup#3034: like a procedural story?
 arcade#9284: Fun stuff. Excited
 Borbito#0304: Roll of the Dice sounds, er, hard. But I'll try my best!
 Occelot Dan#3777: Thanks for pulling these all together! If you haven't already, the folks in  may appreciate these links too
 tcvm#0019: mood
 Tustin2121#6219: Mark's official tweets used #GMTKJam
 IcyPigs#1106: Just got home to see Roll Of The Dice and my brain immediately went to overscoping a roguelike...
 pogrammerX#1167: a rick roll
 BadPiggy#5202: #gmtk2022 then
 Jo the Astronaut#4418: I feel like most folks will use it as a feature (esp in combat situations or a dungeon map) but I would love to see probability as something that isn't those, you know?
 Malloumario#7596: I'm not participating but i got this idea:
You play as a 6 sided dice in a dungeon crawler or 3d platformer.
Each dice side gives you a specific ability and an action  randomizes the active side.
So the player find themselves deciding whether is it worth to do that action or not.
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Yeah looking it over it doesn't look like there's anything official  - that means you get to establish what it is I guess!
 Ice ZeeKay#7335: Hey, how many levels do u think is a good amount for the gamejam game
 Jasper#7906: I'd suggest #gtmkjam2022
 AzE#0001: That is what I'm worried about
 kcorb#6614: Gonna spend all my time making sprites 💀
 snuffysam#2767: probably # gmtk?
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: hmm
 Scolon#4218: I'm making an endless game
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: I'm not aware of one
 Occelot Dan#3777: Didn't even think about randomness as a storytelling concept, that has a ton of potential for sure
 BadPiggy#5202: 
Apologies and pardon the ping....
Is there a hashtag we can tweet to on twitter for our games/progress ?
 Soup#3034: unity is taking annoyingly long to load rn
 Thorvald#1806: You guys, i'm making lots of progress. One might say i'm... on a roll
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: Thanks! You as well haha
 pogrammerX#1167: i use gaia 2021 pro lmao, yes i paid
 Hederlunden#3231: lmao
 Tom Ragtag (He/Him)#8723: So I'm thinking I might intentionally stay away from randomness / risk management as a core mechanic, it seems like the obvious thing everybody else will do (and do it better). Something more strategic / logic based instead.
 Tustin2121#6219: I don't think you can see submissions until the jam closes
 Ber#3410: roblox vibes
 Stuart#4983: I was going to work in UE5 for this one but can't think of what to do that would work well 😬 best I've got is randomised weapons but that's hiding the dice mechanics, I've got a TTRPG i could do but not sure how to make that a video game whilst keeping the dice rolls exposed 😬
 LochNessYeti#8527: Lol, mine too
 DaforLynx#0296: Make it again, and make it better >:)
 Digitaldude555#5515: I think I have an idea now.
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: ah cmgt, good luck with the jam friend :)
 AlexRak2#8367: rip unity ad popups happening
 crdotx#2368: how do we see submissions for the jam?
 Lukey#6052: my laptop is not happy with the amount of ram I'm using ;n;
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: Class discord for the school you were checking out a few months ago
 pogrammerX#1167: no, no i dont i lost my entire terrain 😭
 Occelot Dan#3777: Oh for sure, 50 hours ain't a ton of writing time, but I love the concept! Excited to see what you do with it!
 KonguTORTELLINI#4162: Any way we can network with other devs through this game jam?
 PowerZox#5241: Alright thanks
 octartis#5305: got the idea, very simple with a twist (of the dice)
 Jo the Astronaut#4418: I think that it will be interesting to see how folks incorporate the random element of "roll of the dice" and managing a coherent experience/story with probability
 LochNessYeti#8527: TBH this is basically my first time making a game so I'll just use this as a learning opportunity and am not sure if I'll submit whatever I finish
 Hederlunden#3231: you can make basically everything
 Hobusu#5033: > We try not to put limitations on what people can make, as long as it fits the eligibility discussed above. So if you want to make a mediative walking simulator, a strange piece of interactive fiction, or a highly personal exploration of your own subconscious… go for it.
 Tustin2121#6219: rip
 pogrammerX#1167: rip unity just crashed
 Excalizan#4613: 
 DerpiestDude#2247: 
 Zoro5168#0115: My team has got its idea sorted out
 PowerZox#5241: Are we allowed to make "experiences" instead of games?
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: hey! how do we know eachother? sorry i don’t recognize you instantly
 Ahat#0842: gonna be a demo, cause i dont think i can do a full game in this amount of time
 Chopstix#2107: ty bo
 Aitesedbaن#6908: very exciting!
 VebjornR#6403: Yes! Good idea!
 L1ttel_Y#7220: I agree, I would like to make a demo if my teammates are fine with it. Actually I think demo suites game jams better
 SeanSS#0892: Im actually stumped for what game I should make lol
 Winston#3957: A few useful links:
- Godot Recipes  
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: Oh hey you here as well haha
 Ell#3559: oh sure! shoot me a dm 👌
 locria#8416: team finder is all programmers lol
GMTK *is* a game mechanics channel though
 Hederlunden#3231: tetris
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: we’ve settled on an idea and now we’re going to work! I’m so excited!
 Tapu#9161: Candy crush but with dice assets also work
 Unclouded#9240: i mean over dms at a later date
 SoupScythe#8178: people might find this as good source of inspo for some people
 The_Charmeleon#5954: als oyou you can compile scratch into a html embed file
 Jasper#7906: tetris
 Occelot Dan#3777: This could genuinely be a great way for you to flex some character writing chops, a'la Necrobarista or something!
 Ber#3410: what sounds better
Pokemon but you use a dice to depend on how much health you do and a dice that can give you more health
OR
Tetris but you click a dice and it chooses how many dices are used
 Lukey#6052: scratch doesnt technically require any additional software, because it runs in browser
 Ell#3559: i can't atm sadly 😔 wish i could
 Tustin2121#6219: Roll a die to decide which one :P
 Lavra source#3802: wait is it allowed?
From the rules:
You can not require the user to download additional software from external sources  they should be included in the download and not require separate installation).
 x²#7515: I could only come up with an idea now lol, and I dont even now if it would be fun
 Chopstix#2107: true, but important either way - good luck man
 Ceding Tree#1081: I've got a small idea board, and very simple mechanics going! Not much, but its a start 😄
 (유)니티 좋음/나찰 니티#7281: I made procedural dungeon generation, moveable player.
 Hederlunden#3231: Finally got and prototyped an idea, it is super original, never seen anything like it before, but it is a risk, could end up not working
 4ydam#4079: got like 10 ideas and all are average, can't decide i guess
 who-is-Ellie#8917: thinking of ideas and eating the cake i was making when the jam started hahaha
 MollyFnly#0369: ive made none 😔
 jetpackgone#7645: Heartbeast also has good tutorials for Godot
 Scolon#4218: So how are you guys doing so far, it's been a bit over an hour. I've made a lot of progress
 CrashCubeZeroOne#0715: you forgot to add "I'm dad"
 FéliXD#4922: XD I didn't expect that level of trolling.
 Gammactic#7767: thank you so much! this alongside marks advice will really be useful 👍
 Jasper#7906: you're a winner when you finish your game and you're happy with it, whether people rate it highly or not
 Unclouded#9240: would you be ok with talking about game ideas
 Lukey#6052: Ok woo! I just woke up and I'm going to start brainstorming a bunch of ideas. I love the theme :D
 Ceding Tree#1081: If you actually make a game, then you are winning
 (유)니티 좋음/나찰 니티#7281: Anybody doing it on unity?
 Gumy#7061: Yeah
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i dont think the point of the jam is actually to win you know. just make stuff
 Ell#3559: hi doing it on scratch
 LM#4371: im doing it on clickteam
 L1ttel_Y#7220: Probably won't be rated high by other people
 Psycho_Dopefish#1413: Aight thanks
 FéliXD#4922: I'm doing it on Scratch.
 Aitesedbaن#6908:  where do you get the theme ideas from?
 Tayb#0624: maybe it could be an interesting video idea someday 🤔 especially on what to do in the free version as it has many limitations
 x²#7515: GDQuest, the "making your first game" on the godot documentation is also pretty good!
 Ahat#0842: my idea for the jam is gonna be a dice cafe, where dice relax after a day of being rolled
 Mark Brown#6982: "We try not to put limitations on what people can make, as long as it fits the eligibility discussed above. So if you want to make a mediative walking simulator, a strange piece of interactive fiction, or a highly personal exploration of your own subconscious… go for it. "
 Vasko#4044: don't worry, I have a button that glows when you hover it
 ᵂᶦˢᶦᵏ#9503: I am still using Construct 2 ._.
 aXtwork810#0577: Not all great games are bout graphics tho
 Ell#3559: i'm not on my pc at the moment unfortunately so i dont have the engine in front of me to check what could work 😔
usually, as long as you keep the scope small and the idea simple, you should be able to pull it off in fusion
 Psycho_Dopefish#1413: Hey does anyone know of any good resources for learning how to use godot. I think I’ll use this jam as an opportunity to learn the engine
 Squirtz MD#2049: yes
 Gumy#7061: Are tech demos allowed? What defines a “game”?
 Mark Brown#6982: Right, I'm off! Have a good evening / day - I'll check in throughout the weekend to see how you're all getting on
 Chopstix#2107: unfortunately im working without a game engine or a graphics library XD just straight up code - so not expecting much
 Jasper#7906: nope, I own a "sixed-sided" die that's a sphere. It uses a weight on the inside inside what I assume is cutout with edges to make sure it always rolls a number
 Mark Brown#6982: Never tried it!
 Ahat#0842: hi
 Tustin2121#6219:  It's usually best to go with something you can prototype with fast...
 Tayb#0624: what are your thoughts on construct 3 as a game engine?
 aXtwork810#0577: Neither good nor bad by itself. But if you know how to make elements do interesting things, might also be amazing😉
 DaforLynx#0296: You're not going to participate, Mark?
 chillvibes#1248: I’m doing a game about where you use a playing card to glide on a oversized world, and you get different abilities based on the suit and value of the cards
 Wandere#8088: We're doing a dungeon crawler-esque type game - struggling not to name it Dicey Dungeons 😂
 Ragh#5984: I'm doing an elemental thingy where you combine elements, air element + water element makes ice element, water element + fire element will make explosion element
 bird uwu#4471: isnt that called a marble with the number 1 on it
 Mark Brown#6982: I don't, lol, that's on you lot
 Unclouded#9240: would you be interested about talking about game ideas that would work well in fusion
 Chopstix#2107: do it..
 Bluewolf#7687: 2 sided die lol
 aflyingpotato#7521: currently deciding between two ideas I'm excited about. might roll a die to decide 🤔
 Ell#3559: the fabled d∞ dice
 olifire#9152:  How do you come up with game ideas for game jams?
 easilyBaffled#6027: hmm that's always the hard part of elements
 Mark Brown#6982: This is good
 Tapu#9161: Apparently there are circle die
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: it's been like an hour, you still have time to switch
 Occelot Dan#3777: For those struggling with ideas related to the theme, try thinking about common game mechanics that act as "random dice rolls" in the background and ways to toy around with those randomized mechanics by bringing them to the players attention/into their control.
 Danny Dan Dan#6699: Is it weird that I've come up with my main mechanic, but no I idea what the game will be?
 DerpiestDude#2247: I think you need a reasoning for that
 iofractorg#6427: I have some ideas but I’m not sure how to make them work and I feel they might be a bit difficult to implement and idk if they fit the theme so idk what I should do tbh
 Vasko#4044: I am starting to think that going with SDL and OpenGL instead of an engine wasn't the best idea
 Chopstix#2107: that would also be good, but how would I define how it would interact with another type of power?
 WACOMalt#9001: man I really should have updated unreal before I started...
Edit whoops didnt mean to make that a reply
 Mark Brown#6982: I have to admit I don't really know - a lot the rating algorithm stuff on Itch is secret (for good reason)
 Kaja#5439: So.. no actual dice required? 😉
 Scolon#4218: Guys I just took my first bathroom break :D
 Krisha#6473: now i'm just trying to figure out how to prevent players from just rolling back and forth and amassing a ton of points
 WorkingJoe#4433: Yes, you very much can do anything that's at least somewhat related to dice and/or rolling \:)
 easilyBaffled#6027: that could be really cool, though maybe let people choose what's on their dice
 mattkingz#6689: does this work with all accounts associated with the game?? :0
 Ell#3559: yup, that's usually my engine of choice
 Augs#3262: My advice is to come up with a few ideas and then mash them up into one
 The_Charmeleon#5954: the thinking of ideas is the part i need help with
 DerpiestDude#2247: search up the definitions of all of the words in the theme then put the definitions together for a clearer idea of what to make, who knows sometimes the definitions can spark imagination
 Mark Brown#6982: You can interpret the theme however you want
 Sonti560#1971: I'm going big; I'm making a digital board game. Place your bets now for if i'm gonna finish on time
 L1ttel_Y#7220: But how can you roll a 
 Unclouded#9240: does anyone here know anything about fusion 2.5
 Chopstix#2107: guys want a quick opinion - instead of numbers I thought I would use elements, so its like a fighting game where your powers are determined with a dice roll? Good or bad 😅

 Digitaldude555#5515: Dice poker, poker but with dice.
Dice battle, Roll dice to get a specific number but you can lock dice and roll again.
Royal game of ur
some simple ideas.
 graygray#8956: Maybe think of a few ideas and roll a die over which you'll choose
 Сигма#1382: I have a quick question, do we need to have actually need to feature a literal dice rolling animation? Or can we stretch the meaning a little bit so that it is more related to uncertainty and luck?
 MassedUp#8420: oh nvm i fixed it
 Ell#3559: is the jam game flavoured?
 Krisha#6473: i can't send images here but it's a classic flash puzzle game
 Morg#8585: are the categories for voting in the jam the same as last year?
 The_Charmeleon#5954: anyone got sugestions on how to come up with more ideas? i have some but i want some more before chooseing one. maybe bounceing ideas off a freind? idk first time
 Jasper#7906: That sounds fun too. I do like working outside the box like that. I just like the noun-y dice more even more than that 😁
 Yellowduckgames#5165: im probably gonna leave the jam
 Unclouded#9240: hi
 WACOMalt#9001: maybe I can roll diced rolls
 Tustin2121#6219: TIL
 ZedDev#4726: I'm starting on the main menu since the gameplay is simple to make
 dbo#6487: i was not aware of this
 L1ttel_Y#7220: Rolling objects sounds fun on its own
 SpellCast#5277: hi
 DangerousGlasses#4250: ello
 Mark Brown#6982: Itch.io does have a karma system, so the more games you vote on the more people will see your game
 AzE#0001: I'm good on time lmao the main mechanic is almost done, I just need art, levels and music and then I'm done.
 Krisha#6473: something like block n roll but you are a dice and when you move you get as many points as you "rolled"
 LassiterPrime#8984: I don’t think so
 DerpiestDude#2247: xD 😆
 Gumy#7061: How do the ratings work and how do you make people see your submission more?
 Itooh#5008: Okay, I think I have a solid game-design concept. 🙂 Hope I'll be able to implement most of it.
 Aitesedbaن#6908: samee, I really hope I am able to explore mine to it's full potential though
 Guy_Emu#9812: Boooo!
 bird uwu#4471: hmm ive had an idea for a rythm game called "rock and roll" but im not sure how to work dice in so ill just throw it out here
 Occelot Dan#3777: Same here! I just love watching all the awesome ideas the teams come up with, so there are plenty of non-devs here to hype folks up
 MassedUp#8420: oh no unity's input system is giving up on me
 MakerFaffa#8632: I need it please 😭
 WACOMalt#9001: Good point, I'm thinking I may do something upside down though and do something with the word "dice" meaning "to chop up finely"
 Kaja#5439: Do you guys think it literally has tp involve a die/dice? Or can you go with other randomised mechanics such as wheel of fortune etc.
 Tustin2121#6219: Search online for like a "random idea generator" of some sort, find one that is giving you results you think might help, and just spam through the random text it gives you until it possibly sparks an idea. Fantasy Name Generators has a few sentence generators on it, last I checked.
 honiemun#0001: It happens! Just pick something and run with it, the idea will form out as you start devving
 Mark Brown#6982: The games I stream are selected randomly. You could say they are picked from the.... roll of the dice
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: what is it
 AzE#0001: I have the best idea but I wont leak it
 Krisha#6473: i got an idea for a game but probably nobody to make it a reality with me (and no skills and definitely not the ability to learn to make it in 48 hours)
so if anyone needs some inspiration i can share it
 Falquano#3083: Something I often do when out of ideas is simply taking a game genre or a particular game and thinking about either how the theme is implemented, or if it isn't how it could be. Then I strip down the game of everything I can to make it super simple and boom ! Game.
 Aitesedbaن#6908: try doing a mindmap, write down every idea that you can link to one thing, and then everything that could link to as well, it seems to have worked for me at least
 Balrajjjjjj#8760: yeah I kinda did one, helped me figure out ideas. even simple word association helps
 GodOfPro#7302: I’ve already got the idea but i can’t work on it until tomorrow Sad
 DerpiestDude#2247: mark can u stream my game when it's done :>
 Jasper#7906: I once designed a dice stacking board game for a class. The only time there was any randomness was at beginning when you rolled a limited number of your dice to randomize your arsenal a little bit, as most of the starting numbers were pre-determined. Plenty you can do without using randomness when it comes to dice.
 FryDev#0372: oh, didn’t know that
 MakerFaffa#8632: I dont have any ideas 😭
 LassiterPrime#8984: Second jam for me but this is solid advice. Also, don’t forget about all aspects of the game. I put off sound until the end and ran out of time before and it makes a huge impact on the game
 Ber#3410: is it normal to have 0 good ideas in an hour
 Albertalberto#1865: Gotcha, thanks!
 honiemun#0001: I'm stuck at work right now and can't start coding until 2 hours from now, so I started sketching out ideas on paper. Not being able to start coding until later forced me to come up with something usable in 30 minutes instead of the 3 hours it usually takes me! Gonna start doing that more often
 Mark Brown#6982: Not true! I stream random games from the full collection of submissions
 KonStick66#5147: Finally, I have a good idea! Everyone, good luck! And remember: as one great programming mind said: "Game jams are about learning, not about winning" (or something like that, i don't remember exactly)
 Patrocinio#4174: I've been trying for an hour, and so far, zero ideas. 😦
 Mark Brown#6982: I will do live streams - full details will be announced next week
 Cyan "CyF" Flower#8543: agree
 Aitesedbaن#6908: I just came up with an idea I could center a game on that embraces the theme well I think but puts a small twist that most people wouldn't think of I imagine, and engaging enough to center a game around
 Mark Brown#6982: Prototype, get the basic systems working, add some content, polish, bug fix
 Chopstix#2107: what do you mean by that
 TinyArtificer#7351: Any other non-developers lurking/supporting lol?  Good luck everyone! I look forward to following along!
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i think there's quite a lot of fun with the fact that the first video i rewatched recently of mark that made me aware of the gmtk in the first place was exactly the video on input and output randomness
 FryDev#0372: he streams playing the top 100 rated games, and then showcases 20 of his picks on the YouTube channel
 LackOfBeef#7030: Yeah right now I'm trying to get a bunch together so I can see if any of them interact in cool ways.
 hubertloz64#6737: will there be a karma system? I think it's honest way to promote some games
 Mark Brown#6982: Everything's eligible, you won't get disqualified for not following the theme enough!
 Aitesedbaن#6908: discord thinks your message is a scam for some reason lmao
 quantum#0043:  will you live stream games or show it on yt
 SkyBrave#1435: My mind freezes when I got stressed at the early hours of the jam so I couldn't even come up with an idea, what would be your suggestion? 😅
 Will.#5581: I'm probably going to end up doing another puzzle game.
 Shimp#0064: waiting for genshin impact copies
 Albertalberto#1865: Non-number dices are fun, I'm sure we'll see stuff with those
 Mark Brown#6982: Not by me, but we typically find that every game will get rated by the community. Last year there were over 140,000 ratings
 DarkFluo#1049: try mixing them, expanding them, or putting a twist on them, it'll help them become full ideas ! or you could keep them in the back of your head to add to your final idea when you'll find it !
 Shawk#8857: work from general to specific. in other words, dont spend too much time polishing one thing when you have lots of other more important stuff to work on. polish and details are great, but only do it after youve finished the more basic and important things
 WACOMalt#9001: This theme isnt giving me any interesting ideas yet. Nothing more than "random chance" which... is not really anything groundbreaking XD
 Digitaldude555#5515: oh is this the mark brown creator of the magnet game?
 Xion | Mr. X#0183: Neat.
 Mark Brown#6982: I just think of random words and phrases until something sounds fruitful
 Astrow#4496: Cave people dice
 LassiterPrime#8984: Trying to figure out if an auto battler would be too much for a jam game, any ideas?
 Ber#3410: the idea i have is pokemon but you use a dice for the health you drain and a dice for how many health you could add to yourself i have a picture showing what i have an idea of but i cant send it
 Selviam#7268: this just made the clogs in my head click
 Albertalberto#1865: Oh I wanna ask!
First time joining a game jam solo. Already got an idea down  and starting out the project to make the controls. Any advice for when I'm trying to develop the game so I don't slam my head first into doing something horribly wrong? Or anything to watch out for while doing so?
 quantum#0043: if you a board game, and it stands out, but still includes little of the dice, is it eligible? 
 GuyWithTime#7852: :D
 FryDev#0372: yup
 Shimp#0064: i really like the theme, Mark, its nice and pleases my addiction to gambling!
 mattkingz#6689:  will every game be reviewed?
 L1ttel_Y#7220: Randomness feels like a rather common mechanics
 LackOfBeef#7030: Anyone else having an issue where they have a bunch of little ideas but none that really seem substantial enough to make a game with?
 Will.#5581: Last game jam, I just got my ideas by sleeping.
 Ramkey#2547: You have plenty of time for an idea to pop
 Jasper#7906: yep. Or no sides at all (don't know how you'd do that, but that doesn't mean it's not allowed)
 SkyBrave#1435: My mind freezes when I got stressed at the early hours of the jam so I couldn't even come up with an idea, what would be your suggestion?
 emaker#2708: Google right now "wow results involving unity and dices are going up drastically"
 Xion | Mr. X#0183: How did you come up with the theme for the jam?
 Pyth0n#0572: will your reveal your idea at the end of the jam?
 Starch_Supreme#4835: idk but i love your profile picture
 who-is-Ellie#8917: yep!
 Mark Brown#6982: Keep the scope small. No, smaller! Keep going!
 Ber#3410: im not gonna make a game for this gamejam am i
i have 0 good ideas and my only idea isnt even that good i think
 Shimp#0064: dumb joke counts as creative?
 KonStick66#5147: Dice can have sides with anything?
 Mark Brown#6982: Maybe!
 Gammactic#7767: Considering this is my first game jam (and the same for many others I'd assume), what advice do you have for people to create the best game possible for this jam, especially if they are a solo team?
 Aitesedbaن#6908: do you guys do mind maps? because I just did one and insantly got a really intriging idea
 Mark Brown#6982: Something fresh, creative, imaginative, fun to play - something that makes me smile
 Shawk#8857: are there no voice channels?
 graygray#8956: That's cheating 🥷
 DarkFluo#1049: well, could you reveal it after the jam ? It'd be really interesting to know !
 FryDev#0372: if you were to make a dummy account, hrm???
 Starch_Supreme#4835: What do you look for in a game that stands out from the rest?
 OrangoMango#0973: what if today was friday 13th?
 Mark Brown#6982: Just in case!!
 Mark Brown#6982: Gonna keep that one secret 😛
 quantum#0043: can i submit after the jam
 Ray Oblivion Lock#0892: 👍
 Aishi#5861: jump = roll dice | dice roll = times the player get an impulse every 2 seconds | the player bounce around the level | many obstacle to evase | the player can change the direction in the air
my first idea
 6746#9763: A top down shooter where you have to reach a goal, but moving will roll you, you're a dice.
For each six faces of the dice, you get something random.
1 Is bad, 6 is the best.
My final idea.
 graygray#8956: What's your idea this year for a game?
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: Mark is there a list of diversifiers for this jam similar to GMTK2022? (just while you're here)
 Jasper#7906: yes
 HFK#9999: Im a little late to the party so i have no ideas for this game but im excited to start :)))
 tanbanman#1582: he said yes
 Starch_Supreme#4835: wish i didn't have a 9 hour shift tomorrow, would've loved to do this jam. Wish everyone the best in their development! x
 DarkFluo#1049: pretty interesting ideas, it could lead to a pretty fun game !
 Ray Oblivion Lock#0892: Question can I submit 2 games?
 Mark Brown#6982: Sure!
 Tapu#9161: Sounds fun
 CrashCubeZeroOne#0715: Hi, is construct classic still legal? I see they removed all official download links
 snuffysam#2767: most of them have had nouns in them, like "control" or "mechanic"
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Yeah I'm curious
 Mark Brown#6982: For one, I want to take part! For two, I'll probably be a bit kinder to people in the streams / judging
 BrokenCalculator#2386: gonna ask again because no one answered last time, what do you guys think of this idea:
you have to defend a flag at the top of a mountain from enemies climbing up to the top and you drop dice on them which roll a random number when they collide. the higher the number the more damage is done but also that enemy gets faster
 Selviam#7268: ohh yeah that could work too
 ratata#1252: Haha, i am getting an idea based on a local gambling dice game.
 emaker#2708: does it still fit the theme if the dice result is procedural and you never see a dice actually roll?
 Astrow#4496: For the next theme I kind of want a concept instead of an an
Inanimate object that looks like if a soccer ball was in minecraft
 Pyth0n#0572: mark, you mentioned earlier that you had an idea for the jam but you couldn't enter what was it?
 Mark Brown#6982: That was literally just my dinner, lol
 Tapu#9161: Something like Undertale where you have to click at a specific moment for it to be end up in green else it'll be a bad roll
 SomeTingOdd#8346: Im having trouble too! Lol
 Avian Overlord#3191: GMTK 2023: Shoot OR Move
 who-is-Ellie#8917: petition for egg fried rice?
 Mark Brown#6982: I guess we'll have to wait and see!
 tanbanman#1582: lmaoo
 etet2#3613: lmao
 dap1as#0448: GMTK 2023 theme: fried rice
 Selviam#7268: maybe but im afraid if its raandom like that the player wouldnt have fun with it
 Mark Brown#6982: Take it however you want! A *lot* of people will do luck, so avoiding that would be a good way to stand out
 Beeg scarf#3571: dice definition
1. a small cube with each side having a different number of spots on it, ranging from one to six, thrown and used in gambling and other games involving chance.
2. small cubes of food.
verb
1. play or gamble with dice.
2. cut  into small cubes.
 Starch_Supreme#4835: ooo that's a good question
 FryDev#0372: man this theme is so difficult
 Albertalberto#1865: Giving the player a reason to use the lower numbers seems like a way to go. Think of mechanics that lead to situations in game where the player may want to use lower numbers. Maybe a resource that is spent more the higher the number?
 Govand#8272: #can't relate
 Yellowduckgames#5165: i have no idea what I should make
 Jasper#7906: Has your recent experience with game development changed the way you view the game jam?
 Mark Brown#6982: Yes! I sometimes play it with fellow YouTube video essay people
 Tapu#9161: Why not make the dice jump into air and land on a random face
 GemTheByte#6251: I got a pretty sick idea ngl
 Tustin2121#6219: same. I think that's a privilege reserved for patron peeps.
 Mark Brown#6982: Ask a lawyer, lol
 Zoro5168#0115: Why wasnt the theme related to chilli glazed chicken(rhought y were dropping hints)
 KadDev#8100: it depends on your interpretation of "roll the dice"
 Selviam#7268: So the player has to run into other dice and click a number through 1-6 for their attack. Idk how i'd make it so the player just doesnt spam 6 over and over? Should i give the other numbers special abilities or something?
 Mark Brown#6982: That's up for you lot to decide!
 LightLeviathan#1443: NO THE WEREHOG IS WHAT MY GAME IS BASED ON
 Mark Brown#6982: Yes, you can submit multiple games
 dbo#6487: why cant i leave emoji reactions?
 Astrow#4496: Bro I'll just have a normal protagonist who just has a fear of dice and wants to eradicate them
 Max - Winteractive#9512: In that case:
Was it a difficult decision to put a noun in the theme? And on the topic of picking a theme associated with RNG: During the theme-voting phase of LDJAM, an avalanche of themes along the lines of "random", "chance", "procedural" show up. These never make it far. Could this years theme be a case of "don't give the people what they say they want"?
 KonguTORTELLINI#4162: hello new here
 Mark Brown#6982: I have! Sonic bits are pretty great, Werehog is crap
 spagoogi#5559: that is incredible
 KonStick66#5147: Should game be necessarily about luck, or can it be just something about dice?
 Mystical_Pidgeon#1588: fruit ninja with dice?
 steeleater#7580: wait is anyone actually making a game in pico 8
 Mark Brown#6982: Can't beat a classic D6
 Raphus#4124: hello mark brown i am mark white
 Avian Overlord#3191: 2D then.
 GuyWithTime#7852: That moment when you use gamemaker and have no choice but to go with 2D
 Magnet#2255: Oh lawd, an hour's already passed
 Zoro5168#0115: My game will be called medieval zillionare
 6746#9763: mark have you ever played the hit game "among us"?
 Mark Brown#6982: Upload early and often 😉
 Ice ZeeKay#7335: time flies when you're ~~completely stressed out of your mind~~ having fun
 LiquidCode#4117: The theme also refers to randomness? (Without a dice)
 Gumy#7061: Are gambling games age-appropriate for general audiences?
 Ave#3450: what if we make music by severely messing with *potentially* copyrighted music until its an unrecognizable creepy ambient track
 Freaky Aguilar#4641: Me and My partner had our business breakfast and came up with a decent design, time to try to implement it 😄
 Tustin2121#6219: 2D is usually easier to do quickly.
 Mark Brown#6982: Nope! Gotta focus on running this thing, sadly - I feel like I'm missing out this year!
 DerpiestDude#2247: only 47 more hours*
 LightLeviathan#1443: that's what my game is based on lol *werehog moment*
 sushiman#4823: its impossible to find a good idea..
 snuffysam#2767: good luck
 spagoogi#5559: you still have 47 of them you'll be fine
 RayZor#8982: brroooo samee
 Mark Brown#6982: Good! Jam day is always good fun 😄
 Tapu#9161: You could make a casino manager game where your job is to find those damn cheaters who are using loaded dice
 Avian Overlord#3191: That feeling when you have an idea but don't know if 2D or 3D is the way to go.
 Mark Brown#6982: You can read the theme however you like, so "dice" as in dicing food is perfectly fine!
 6746#9763: i guess that tells us both something lol
 😂👌#4209: How has it already been an hour 😭
 shuhai#8582: Do you think this year's theme is good, will it be too difficult for the creator
 Ice ZeeKay#7335: if i finish making a game, im allowed to make another and submit it too right (cuz i got multiple ideas lol)
 Dr. Puzzler#1894: yes.
 Morg#8585: what's your favorite kind of die?
 Sonti560#1971: Do we need to add a dice to our games
 LightLeviathan#1443:  have you ever played sonic unleashed
 Mark Brown#6982: Nothing in particular, just felt like it would be an interesting challenge for people
 GuyWithTime#7852: Are you going to be making a game as well?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: favorite kind of dice (d20, d8, d6, percentile)
 OrangoMango#0973: any advices?
 KobaHawk#0718: roll the dice actually needs a dice or can be interpreted as a luck game in general?
 sbubby#4885: yeah this is why i love this
it goes against "standard" design principles cause you almost feel obligated to include that dreaded RNG in some way
 BrokenCalculator#2386: are you taking part since you are a game dev now?
 who-is-Ellie#8917: how are you feeling today? :)
 RayZor#8982: yo thats my idea
 Jasper#7906: what was the inspiration for this theme?
 spagoogi#5559: rewatch the video on input and output randomness!
 Mark Brown#6982: Slice n' Dice
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Your best dice related pun title for my game
 6746#9763: a wave top down shooter where what happens in the wave depends on what the dice lands on, you could get 5 enemies or 10 depending on the dice. What do you think?
 dbo#6487: an fmv game would actually be really cool!
 Mark Brown#6982: Right, you've got 30 minutes to ask me questions about the jam and I'll try my best to answer them all
 TwoWholeWorms#8078: You Only Roll Twice
Crit Fails Are Forever
Goldendie
Dicey-no Royale 
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: 
 GuyWithTime#7852: I have actively decided that my game wont have a story whatsoever because it was giving me massive problems in my previous gameJam
 Teeb#6147: anyone wanna team up with me and an artist
 Ice ZeeKay#7335: first second i didn't like the theme cuz i couldnt think of anything, now that im thinking of stuff that's more unique i think it's really fun and i can't choose between ideas
 DerpiestDude#2247: same
 Space#0859: This topic though👁️👄👁️
 sbubby#4885: super cool theme ngl, i love it
 bagel03#7025: Huh, games with randomness tend to get players agitated
 shuhai#8582: why not try
play the devil
You desperately want to kill that person
So I said that if you don't roll 5, you will die
But he was lucky
Find ways to change the outcome
 DarkFluo#1049: lmaooo
Welp apparently modern english said "welp, let's make "dice" to all the work", so I shouldn't have to use "die"
 Frozen#7676: Im making a factory builder. I probably wont get top 1000 but its gonna be a learning experience
 ratata#1252: I have an idea but not sure  I will be able to execute it.
 Astrow#4496: Dice is multiple die is single
 TiroFueguito#0756: with themed dices... 1 dice with fire spells, water, etc.. some dice can contain pros and cons that make the player take choices... also, the result can be more or less powefull according dice result
 OctoDisco#5649: cute
 Tapu#9161: That reminded me of the Family guy "credit card debt" song
 Tustin2121#6219: So, an FMV game? lol
 Tsunami#0963: they clearly want more 3d games huh
 Victorec#5051: Trying to come out with an idea. I just came back from a long walk
 q12xp#1711: Gambling games are being encouraged
 spagoogi#5559: cook the dice!!!!
 Morg#8585: now im crossing my fingers my silly little dice pun will remain unused
 Kyo Ricardo#4586: nice one
 TheGameShePlays#7762: I decided mine would relate in terms of the story rather than a mechanic as such, so I'm listening to relevant music while I set things up.
 mtoon#8128: French to and know it
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Catchy
 DerpiestDude#2247: me who's making a cooking game
 Hobusu#5033: Native English speakers get it wrong all the time, so you probably don't need to worry about it *too* much
 dbo#6487: Gonna just submit a video of me rolling dice for dollar bills in an alleyway
 LambdaPyro#6782: I sometimes feel like my ideas get clogged when i try "thinking out of the box"
 Astrow#4496: I'm in severe credit card debt
 6746#9763: so relatable man, it's been an hour and i still have no ideas.
 graygray#8956: Anyone want to do the super hard game idea of 6 different genres and you roll for that level?
 OrangoMango#0973: how are you everyone doing?
 Frozen#7676: thats good
 DarkFluo#1049: maaaannnn, I'm gonna have to search the difference between "Dice" and "Die"... (i'm french so even is I'm a pretty good english speaker, I still have thingd like that to learn)(also don't bother explaning, I'll do my research)
 ratata#1252: I am not getting any idea
 Will.#5581: Die Hard
 SquidGeneral10#4090: yes
will i reveal them?
no
 Hobusu#5033: I believe that means they aren't on the server anymore, not sure if there's much you can do about that
 dap1as#0448: has a jam theme ever been changed
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Anyone got any dice related pun titles?
 Avian Overlord#3191: 🎲
 GuyWithTime#7852: You know what youre right
 Astrow#4496: TRUEEEEE
 gavin#6656: roll of the dice
 Raphus#4124: 3️⃣ 1️⃣
 Ray Oblivion Lock#0892: Theme revealed?
 tcvm#0019: I love the theme, it allows for so much interpretation
 Mew#7314: Help I got pinged in team nofis, but I dont know how to react to this:
```Hey @Mew ,  wants to get in contact about your Team Finder post!```
 xriva#0378: the idea is tough
 Tapu#9161: Mark, say whatever you wanna say but best theme was ||Pants are for losers||
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: the theme's fine
 spagoogi#5559: oh my god i vote purple
 LorantC#5076: I think it's one of the most broad and open themes yet. Not sure why people get stuck on "dice" ideas. The theme is also an expression
 Action Dawg#5943: nah itd be game without game
 Morg#8585: next year's theme: ** **
 SquidGeneral10#4090: I'll criticize it for that 👺 i do not like this theme, markymoo
it feels like, at most, we'll see 5 ideas repeated repeatedly
 GuyWithTime#7852: Next years theme: **Game**
 nightknight#1442: Platforms as dice sounds really cool! Maybe at the start of the level, all the platforms (dice) roll and their values could be set, that denotes the number of seconds the player can stand on them before they break? When player lands on a platform die tile, the die starts counting down
 graygray#8956: How would you make the first feel fun with the RNG? can you control the spells somewhat like if it rolls a fireball you can control the direction or would it just be roll and play until you get a good run?
 indspenceable#4861: this theme is my favorite yet ngl
 theChief#0001: I've done over 100 jams
Yeah
This still holds
 JJfriends#3686: hes a vamp bro
 NitramiuZ#4145: I've finally got a good idea for how to fit the theme, but I have no clue of how the gameplay should look
 Raphus#4124: ZOOOOOOOOOORT
 Hobusu#5033: Brown, obvs
 KingLucky#2526: I like the theme this year
 x²#7515: "the theme sucks" is a constant on every jam lol
 Astrow#4496: Maybe it's getting vaguer and vaguer every single year
 Chazi b#4006: I love it and hate it at the same time, just like every theme
 NoelJasik#8768: Great
 Avian Overlord#3191: Because Mark feeds on our suffering.
 Frozen#7676: next year the themes just gonna be a color
 DannyK1994#9186: Doing my best to avoid using dice 😬😬😬😬
 tcvm#0019: my favourite part of game jams is seeing everyone go "this theme stinks", it's happened in every one ive participated in lol
 theChief#0001: A roguelike where you start with one of six bonus traits!
 dap1as#0448: yeah this theme seems a lot more vague than previous years
 No_Namer007#8260: lol yes
 Roof#6985: stop the cap
 GuyWithTime#7852: I would do it then
 Mark Brown#6982: nothing in the rules to say otherwise!
 Will.#5581: Not the only one.
 Rare Sage#3005: Make a game where the player is a die and has a roll ability
 JJfriends#3686: man why couldn't we get a easy theme
 Tapu#9161: Here's a idea that you can quickly execute: make a match the tiles game, but with dice faces
 bagumus#5836: No I am struggling as well
 KonStick66#5147: No
 NoelJasik#8768: Hey i have a question, can a game for the jam be casino themed?
 Victorec#5051: Am I the only one who has no proper idea?
 emaker#2708: I could likely get it done if i ditched the dice part but kept the mechanic of randomness. animating a rolling dice in 3D with good ol QUATERNIONS! might prove a challenge
 No_Namer007#8260: Odd One Out
 TiroFueguito#0756: so i'm in between a mage that throws a dice then the spell appears (like metronome of pokémon) and... and infinite "dice" runner where the player must keep rolling the dice, when the dice stops game over 🤔
 spagoogi#5559: my current idea involves you being a silly little guy on top of a rolling die but it is going to be multiple millennia before i have an actual full idea
 L3mmy♡#2307: *KSP pfp spotted*
 mtoon#8128: Thanks ;-:
 Morg#8585: seeing progress pictures has me excited
 Lena#1233: I hadn't even considered anything other than numbered or dotted die. Interesting
 CookiesRiot#2732: same though
 Max - Winteractive#9512: i forgive you
 Astrow#4496: Dice rolls as it's animation but it can also shoot and all the other enemies are slot machines and the dice is trying to stay alive in the days of slot machines
 DungeonGhost#6162: Imagine if someone tried to make a game for the jam in like scratch or something like that
 Charade#1579: I have my game idea, but it won't be fully fleshed out cuz I have work tonight and tomorrow lol 🤡
 GuyWithTime#7852: I would take the idea where you can be at least 75% sure you can get it done
 mtoon#8128: Apology letter for not being able to participate:
Sorry for not being able to participate I would have loved it but I'm on vacation and my laptop can't handle unreal so I thought I'd do my game on scratch  but my connection doesn't allow it and I apologize a thousand times.
 6746#9763: its been an hour and i sitll dont have any ideas
 VinRzR#6204: cool
 Crusher48#2092: I have an idea based on moving dice across a board by rolling them and then whatever side they end up on determines their abilities
 Tustin2121#6219: I offered this idea to someone else doing a platformer: Roll 4d6 and that's how many jumps you have. Or you can sacrifice one of the rolled die (and the jumps it gave you) for a platform placed somewhere strategic.
 Doodles?#8052: Free Idea: A shooter game with a revolver, only instead of a barrel it's got a free-spinning die. A one-thru-six shooter, if you will~
 q12xp#1711: xD
 kypello#1505: chess, but each piece is a die with a picture of a chess piece on each side, and when you move a piece it rolls based on how many spaces it moves and becomes a different piece
 Avian Overlord#3191: Symbol dice over numbers would be a good start. Or each dice determines a quantity of something, like monsters.
 Aishi#5861: my first idea was that hahahha
 Melwing#3159: Haha, what does that AMATEUR know? xD
 emaker#2708: I'm stuck between 2 ideas, the one that sounds like it would be more fun, I'd likely struggle to get it done
 KonStick66#5147: Lets make a shoot-to-move game, pretty good and original idea
 Astrow#4496: Dice with gun dice with gun
 AromaticA#3738: time to program rolling gacha anime tits
 Ell#3559: lmao
 pixelBoy#0082: some idea : is a shooter game but the dice choose your weapon throw some spinning wheel
 Lena#1233: I'm thinking something along the lines of the player rolling dice from a first person top-down perspective, and then dealing with the results as a 3rd person or 2d character
Not sure how to make the second half of that interesting, though. I keep coming back to the dice as platforms, but don't know what would make different rolls meaningful
 Beeg scarf#3571: LOL
 Ice ZeeKay#7335: im going crazy
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: I like the theme
 GuyWithTime#7852: Bro won before even starting
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: sadly the rick roll dice joke has already been made
 Zoro5168#0115: So the theme IS shoot to move
 Aless.c06#6763: I have a rolling dice 👍
 Karto#7782: Hi mark
 Crusher48#2092: How many dicey dungeons clones are we going to have?
 q12xp#1711: WE HAVE A WINNER!
 Fetter Skrue#9468: Then I will make a pizza-simulator
 Error Loading...#6270: Rick roll but it’s dice 👍
 Astrow#4496: Oh damn that's a lot of time
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: a puzzle game where you use dice to move across tiles and you get points based on each tile you walk on
 Sheep777#3876: I think I have an idea, I just want feedback and to maybe help someone else: You are in a top down shooter or whatever, and then once you start a level you have to pick like 3 or so cards out of a deck, and each card will have something good, and something bad about it, then the game will choose which ones will be bad and which will be good, and I dont know from there
 Zoro5168#0115: Guys imagine dice in chess
 6746#9763: scolon i don't even have an idea yet how are you this fast?
 (유)니티 좋음/나찰 니티#7281: monopoly, chess, scrabble, the game of life
 Mark Brown#6982: A reminder from the rules "you will not be disqualified from the jam if your game doesn't adequately fit the theme."
 Tustin2121#6219: So, an actual d100 (and not the 2d10 thing)?
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: How about a rolling game where you roll down a slope, but you can change the number of sides you have to change your dices physics of roll (6 sides is bumpy = jumping, whereas 20 is smooth) to try and compelte the course
 Gumy#7061: It’s not about the dice guys, it’s about *the roll* of the dice.
 Veqsa#8120: i already got mine
 kypello#1505: someone give me an idea please, I got nothing
 Beeg scarf#3571: 6 hours
 Fetter Skrue#9468: must pay for pic
 Onomi#7378: how many of y'all are naming your game "slice and dice"
 Error Loading...#6270: You guys are missing the clear best idea
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: we've already started ours it worked perfectly with one of our talks
 Fox#3756: How long do you guys usually spend on ideation before you pick an idea and just go with it?
 dap1as#0448: do you want to work together i have a decent idea
 ryan123#4605: why can’t i post pictures here
 Astrow#4496: Actually, using rocks to signify binary is the legitimate way to program
 Zoro5168#0115: Drop me a list of board games
 Tornado#0975: AHHH TOO HARD TO FIND A DECENT IDEA
 coolhotdogguy#4788: Spherical dice that roll and never land on a side
 BadPiggy#5202: Anyone have an idea ?
 Ceding Tree#1081: monopoly
 Scolon#4218: This is the first jam that I got an idea I'm really happy with very quickly. It's all about the execution now
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: again is there diversifiers I can't find any?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: as long as it can be played on browser in the itch page and or you can make it an executable it's allowed
 Vubobinali#0059: h
 Hobusu#5033: As long as the final submission runs on Windows and/or in browsers without needing additional programs, it's allowed!
 Astrow#4496: It is any engine is allowed
 joshe woshe#6343: scratch is allowed but is kinda stupid
 Jácint [Slava Ukraini 🇺🇦]#7098: if it can do a windows or a browser runnable game it is
 TheRayvenn#0001: I used scratch last year
 who-is-Ellie#8917: if you're not using punch cards then you're doing it wrong
 dap1as#0448: ive already got a decent idea for what i want to make but have no idea how to whip it up in unity (scratch was a joke btw)
 x²#7515: real programmers use cosmic rays with a magnifying glass to change bits on a hard drive
 kypello#1505: pretty sure scratch is allowed
 Scolon#4218: Not sure if scratch is allowed for submissions
 nekiwo#7574: LOL we have 40 people right now
 Ell#3559: MMO RPG with procedural generation and AI NPCs :)
 6746#9763: of course not im not making a cooking simulator for a game jam
 Astrow#4496: No not at all completely legit engine as much as any other engine
 Lena#1233: No. Game jam's a game jam. Make something  cool and have fun
 TheRayvenn#0001: screw game engines, screw programming languages, i'm using binary!
 TheGameShePlays#7762: I'm at the "what did music sound like in ancient Rome" stage of the process right now 😂
 KonStick66#5147: Good idea! Someone's definetly gonna do it
 spagoogi#5559: horror dice.....,,,,
 Zoro5168#0115: Ok
 K'miinik#3171: I'm still screwing with concepts
 kypello#1505: has anyone though about "dice" as in dicing food
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: You can interpret the theme however you want. It doesn't even need to be literal dice
 Selviam#7268: romance sim, tomodachi, top down shooter, horror
 Advice#7777: :(
 Scolon#4218: I got my basic player controller up and running
 6746#9763: if we all have an idea of randomness and playing dice then there's clearly an issue with the theme /s
 Kyo Ricardo#4586: SDL :troll_face:
 dap1as#0448: is it dumb to use scratch engine
 x²#7515: try not to overscope
 MaryStrawberry#4672: yall I got a solution for everyone
 Astrow#4496: Ask local gambler who has a problem
 SalaMala#1068: yessss
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: I'm done setting up my git and my gitignore and basic unity file structure, but we're looking for diversifiers before we start, is there a list?
 Lena#1233: That's entirely up to your interpretation
 DerpiestDude#2247: unity
 VVill#0133: You have 5 hours until midnight
 Mr. Lonely#5553: This is my first Game Jam, anyone got any advice?
 Ishmhora#8802: let me go watch the randomness video another 5 times in the next hour
 Starch_Supreme#4835: may be a stupid question but does the game *need* to involve dice? Or can I just do something that's RNG-based but doesn't involve dice?
 kypello#1505: I feel like all of my ideas are too similar to dicey dungeons
 IceyMations#9584: I have an idea
 Selviam#7268: yea that sounds good
 Zoro5168#0115: Drop me a list of genres please
 xqrd#4298: gl everyone 🙂 im gonna tommorow start working on my game beacuse its 7 pm for me
 Fetter Skrue#9468: Ho Ho Ho!
 SoupScythe#8178: Hey Hey Hey
 CodeIGuess#8220: my plan is to draw the different dice and then like 2-3 frames of animation inbetween for the rolling tbh
 Astrow#4496: He looks like he wants to peck your toes
 OrangoMango#0973: here
 Ell#3559: Real Legends use "dice" for both singular *and* plural, dont @ me 🍷
 MaryStrawberry#4672: they're alcoholics, wine is their solution for everything
 KonStick66#5147: Sorry, misspelled. Do we use normal definition of dice, or google definition of dice?
 SalaMala#1068: will it save my homeboy on a nat 20?
 hackel#9932: just dont
 Ayden#0303: Here
 Aishi#5861: same
 6746#9763: i love linux 😹 😹 ©️
 Pyth0n#0572: in 5e rulebooks, they just say d100
 emaker#2708: here's an idea, what if the dice didn't have number on it?
 JesusSVasquez#1009: You roll a 20 faced dice, : If you get 20, you kill Vecna
 AlexBR#3963: Here
 wren#0640: i was gonna dm my composer and be like hey! i got the mechanic based on the theme working but the moment i started recording on obs it broke lol
 Selviam#7268: im nervous about how im gonna make dice roll since i can only do 2d pixel art
 Tustin2121#6219: Other kinds of dice, often used in D&D: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, d% (that is two d10s with one representing 10s place). I also have a couple d2s which are weird and not just coins.
 Beeg scarf#3571: i loathe the linux penguin
 Astrow#4496: Dude die = 1 dice >= 2
 krisis in a jar#0904: LINUX GANG!!! RISE!!!
 VVill#0133: I wanna dice lol
 Jasper#7906: Nope, don't think I'll have any sort of movement whatsoever

 Chopstix#2107: ty bro
 MrBen#0001: nope

 Michel#2879: I assume everyone is doing dice movement
 x²#7515: It can also have more than 6 faces!
 L3mmy♡#2307: seeing everyone say die instead of dice is funny
 DanarKayfi#0198: Remember rolling the dice mean probability also 😉
 Astrow#4496: Sussy
 Apocryphactor#2025: working name: Pip-Popper
 Beeg scarf#3571: remember that dices can have less that 6 faces
remember that dices can have anything as a result not just numbers
 KonStick66#5147: Do we use normal definition of the dice, or google definition of die?
 Selviam#7268: Oooo thats cool
 GuyWithTime#7852: I think imma just do a top down shooter lesgo
 Digitaldude555#5515: remember that dice dont need numbers on them
 ColtsFan10#6790: huh, the more yk

 Starch_Supreme#4835: thanks, good luck to you too! All the best
 Advice#7777: ya i did
 Veqsa#8120: Huh but im just offering to send 6 png files of all dices 1-6
 Hobusu#5033: They did say "erotic" visual novel
 VVill#0133: OP said erotic though
 Ell#3559: too many dating sims, not enough friendship sims, smh smh smh..... ||/s||
 OrangoMango#0973: remember that dices can have more that 6 faces
 DarkFluo#1049: okay welp 45min in I'm still here talking about my ideas, I think it's time for me to stop talking and start working . Good luck everyone, and have fun !
 Lyfe#8258: man i am struggling to think of anything properly solid
 Astrow#4496: Dating probably shouldn't involve nudity 💀 that's a weird date if it does
 Anders429#2892: 1 die 2 dice 3 dices
 Jasper#7906: yes, 1 die and 2 dice (though using it as singular is now so common it's considered correct)
 SalaMala#1068: This is very exciting
 Morg#8585: i think you're totally fine to make a dating sim visual novel, just as long as it's sfw?
 coolhotdogguy#4788: or medium and media
 Hobusu#5033: > Your game must not contain nudity, or hateful language or visuals. This could see your game being disqualified. Please consider avoiding extremely strong language and excessive gore, as the jam should be suitable for a general audience. If you’re uncertain, err on the side of being less gratuitous.
I wasn't saying that they couldn't do it, just to make sure to keep it on the safe side
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: easy on the caps lock
 Ell#3559: what if it were about making new friends :)
 a wild sundar! (they/them)#8591: expanding on this: since we dont have to use numbers, i was thinking that u would have to write an essay, but for some parts u roll a dice to get certain words/phrases? and u have to piece it all together to get out?
 Tustin2121#6219: I'm reminded of my stats teacher telling us that it's "one datum" and "two data", etc.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yes
 shuhai#8582: SHOULDN'T, CREATE STORY IS VERY LONGER
 ColtsFan10#6790: dice is plural tho?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Yea
 longghead#8064: The jam page says submissions close in 23 hours on my screen that’s a error right
 Apocryphactor#2025: dropping this idea here for anyone who wants to use it, because my team has decided to do something else:
you're doing an arena fight against a giant 6-sided die that's slowly trying to crush you, and you can only kill it by placing explosives on the ground that'll knock the pips out when the dice next flips over 
 kcorb#6614: Yeah, I'm gonna go with >=2 it makes me uneasy lol
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: 
 Astrow#4496: What? I thought we could make anything and is a dating Sim visual novel really that exclusive anyways that's pretty far fetched
 Digitaldude555#5515: I know having any battle type game with 2 days is a trap...
 Veqsa#8120: Anyone needs pictures of top view drawn dices 1-6...
dm me
 OrangeKingdom#9769: **I have a question, Should the game based on a story **
 Jasper#7906: nope. It disheartens me every time someone does it, but dice is often used to refer to a singular object
 krisis in a jar#0904: i've got an idea, time to make le game (anyone here using python to make their games?)
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: you can interperate it however you want
 Hobusu#5033: Remember that Jam submissions must be suitable for a general audience!
 VinRzR#6204: what if the "dots" in the dice are like a formation for troops or something
 Millie#2300: imo no
 Selviam#7268: genetics using dice?
 Beeg scarf#3571: when i saw roll i immediately thought donkey kong country
 aiursrage2k#2480: At least 2 dice
 Linnet#3241: holy shit had the same idea
 MrBen#0001: man please give ideas 😭
 Pikachao#3814: My immediate first though was using the actual rolling of dice as an attack or something
 Maksu#4798: im looking at the wikipedia page for the number four, and turns out that it has a lot more symbolism than I would've thunk
 Astrow#4496: Damn you really can't pull if you only get in relationships with 1/6 people you end up dating
 kcorb#6614: Is it against the theme to use a single die over two dice do you think
 bzar#0579: stealing for future use thanks
 shuhai#8582: IDEA: You are not playing the dice, and you are not the one who cast the dice, you are the dice falling on the table
 Ian Mykl#4218: lmao, I was thinking of something super similar to this
time to get a new idea
 GuyWithTime#7852: ohhhh shi ur right
 D47ks#7986: Bruh , that was an idea i had
 Advice#7777: idea: an erotic visual novel where you have to roll the dice to determine if you successfully seduced the girl.
 SmTheRealDev#8195: I'm stil trying to get the damn square to move. 😩
 Beeg scarf#3571: holy crap its the youtubes guy
 SaadTheGlad#9716: What if the game is based entirely on a pun
 Astrow#4496: Ooh six enemy types each weak to one side of a dice
 krisis in a jar#0904: so true lmao
 Zayed#7379: Ikr
 Tustin2121#6219: Remember that dice don't just have to have numbers on the side. There can be other things, like pluses/minuses or pictures.
 Starch_Supreme#4835: OMG ITS MARK HI :)
 Gumy#7061: Here’s a tip everyone: The dots on a dice are called “pips”. Hope that helps!
 a wild sundar! (they/them)#8591: idea: ur stuck in detention and u roll a die to see how good of an excuse you can think of to get out? (but im not sure how to implement gameplay yet)
 DarkFluo#1049: welp I'll be keeping the ones I like the most, but I can give you those that I probably won't use :
- a plateformer game where you roll the dice at certain points and it changes the level / gives you abilities / changes the game based on the result
- a game where you play again unfait odds, like an RPG with a dice weighted to make you loose
I'll be keeping the few other I got, but I don't really like these ideas that much so it's safe to say I won't be working on them
 Ibra#8468: Random.Range calls rn: 📈
 Mark Brown#6982: ooh that's interesting
 x²#7515: when in doubt make a top down shooter!
 Sheep777#3876: I think I have an idea, I just want feedback and to maybe help someone else: You are in a top down shooter or whatever, and then once you start a level you have to pick like 3 or so cards out of a deck, and each card will have something good, and something bad about it, then the game will choose which ones will be bad and which will be good, and I dont know from there
 SockPoppet#6054: I think I'm going to work on a game where you're a young goblin who has a dream of becoming a roadside alchemist, and you run away to escape from your dad forcing you into a career patrolling the dungeon, then you find a magical trinket that plays a big part in your foraging/brewing your wares
 SublimatedSerpent#5808: Was gonna go for a side-scroller
 mtoon#8128: I will
 GuyWithTime#7852: Maybe you play **on** a dice and you can switch sides
 EzeTxle#5663: so what about a game in which you receive different events based on rolls of a dice but you can go back in time and use the rolls in your advantage?
 OrangeKingdom#9769: I will
 coolhotdogguy#4788: oooh nice
 Eminon#9033: I was thinking something where each side represents a different attack
 vilet918#8645: me
 Astrow#4496: 2d platformers are the only thing I know how to make 💀
 LightLeviathan#1443: tip: if you don't know what to make, make a top down shooter
 theChief#0001: Top down shooters are, in my opinion the easiest type of game to make 😂
 krisis in a jar#0904: i've been defeated
 D47ks#7986: Same here !!
 a wild sundar! (they/them)#8591: i thought of something
 musabIsCool#8070: Who else thought of king dice
 VinRzR#6204: maybe the floor tiles have numbers and the number the dice lands interacts with that
 Ice ZeeKay#7335: i think implementing a platformer with dice is p kwl
 Pikachao#3814: First game jam babie!!
 Gumy#7061: Or a top down shooter
 Avian Overlord#3191: Maybe the dice sides have different powers? And whichever is up when a timer ticks gets used.
 MrBen#0001: yes I will 🤨
 Space#0859: This topic tbh💀
 MagiGuy789#4139: Screw you I'm doin a puzzle platformer now
 krisis in a jar#0904: TIP: DON'T MAKE A PLATFORMER, they are hard to make
 Prabhakar#5069: great
 OrangeKingdom#9769: Can I use any asset
 THE_MX0004#2535: am i allowed to use the asset store?
 VinRzR#6204: im thinking about this too
 imad#7690: that sounds fun
 Sheep777#3876: I think I have an idea, I just want feedback and to maybe help someone else: You are in a top down shooter or whatever, and then once you start a level you have to pick like 3 or so cards out of a deck, and each card will have something good, and something bad about it, then the game will choose which ones will be bad and which will be good, and I dont know from there
 Martin111#0333: cuphead vibes
 xqrd#4298: you roll the dice but depending on what you get you change games and there are 6 of them and ur goal is to complete at least one game while on a timer (or no timer)
 Morg#8585: dark mode twitter has consumed the logo, it's just two floating dice and "of the"
 Gumy#7061: Yes!!
 emaker#2708: yeh just scale it down, 1 enemy and 1 character
 Scolon#4218: I would throw out some of my ideas here, but the idea I decided on is a bit too similar to my scrapped ideas.
 coolhotdogguy#4788: A game where you play as a die and move by rolling from side to sdie. Then whichever number is facing up means....something?
 MrBen#0001: I mostly aim for platformer
 Zuzle#8193: Don't know why but i feel like making a game about punching the dice to get the outcome you want.
 tcvm#0019: I'm going to make a hack n slash where before a given level you are given a choice to buff a stat at the cost of another stat, so youre rolling the dice on whether or not the stat you lose is worth it
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Welp I got some places to be. I'll be back later this evening possibly still without work (that'll flow in when I'm asleep XD)
 Astrow#4496: Also yall could make turn-based rpgs with crits if your stuck
 vilet918#8645: im thinking brick breaker but the ball is a dice and has to be the right number to break the blocks
 stylo#0920: yo i search for a team if someone need 3D models i can model everything
 Tustin2121#6219: Does it have to be based on luck, or just look like it's based on luck? Maybe the dice aren't really that random?
 LightLeviathan#1443: okay using the playcanvas game engine now *which uses javascript*
 krisis in a jar#0904: can you reduce the message timer? it's literal pain
 JustAnArtisticPagan#9586: in 48 hours???
 MagiGuy789#4139: Does it have to be random? Could we just do something based off of dice that isn't random
 6746#9763: to *die* down a bit. sorry.
 EzeTxle#5663: please
 wan#8952: thanks imma start prototyping now and see if its not too ambitious
 JonasanJoestar#2767: I have simulator of dnd master)))
 Martin111#0333: Thinking of a game where the Dots on the dice just peel off and stick to the ground
maybe tasked with making some pattern
 Mark Brown#6982: Wait for the craziness to die down a bit and then ask if anyone's got any ideas 😛
 DarkFluo#1049: welp if any of you want ideas, I got a few that I'm probably not going to use, I could throw that out here
 GuyWithTime#7852: Thats literally what I was thinking
 Gumy#7061: Someone make a video game version of D&D !!
 Scolon#4218: I have 9 things I need to make to get this prototype up and running
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: ambitious! good luck
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Cant wait!
 Pangords#8020: thats great mark! where do i find them?
 shuhai#8582: You need to change the surrounding environment to make the dice what you want
 theChief#0001: I'm doing a top down shooter with a heavy focus on randomised loot. I'm also going to have a feature that lets you roll the dice and try for something new/better - for a cost 😂
I'll probably also make it a rhythm shooter and have fun things happen when you shoot on the beat, because audiosync is fun
 JustAnArtisticPagan#9586: that sounds neat.
 KimTheMightyChim#0685: everyone knows a real game dev can't finish their game on time because they think they ca build an open world rpg in 48 hours B)
 RedLine#5009: Jailbreak for dice that have been put into dice jail 🙂
 wan#8952: what do you guys think of a turn-based western survival game? you have the roll a dice to take different actions, the goal is to survive and try to get to the town before you die
 krisis in a jar#0904: screw it, i'm making a bullet hell
 spagoogi#5559: thinking is hard......,,,
 Zayed#7379: That's where u have to think and get some skill inovled
 zyugyzarc#0314: you can port it to micropython or python on wasm, and have it run on a browser
 Astrow#4496: You going to implement that complex theme in 2 days? Damn. I was thinking like random spawn point when you die
 Cyndaquil#2646: Why not make a game like cookie clicker!!?
 Seda Tive#3519: Parody of save scumming for rng
 DarkFluo#1049: that is genius !
 Pangords#8020: philosofical game. i like it
 Selviam#7268: im going with good ol' fashioned 2d pixel art since thats all i can do for now!
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: so a light hearted game then 😄
 OrangeKingdom#9769: Now I have to find some assets 👍
 Scolon#4218: Ok, I setup my itch.io page. Time to start programming :D
 Sheep777#3876: I think i might have an idea
 emaker#2708: still struggling a lot with a good idea, my dev skills are very rusty
 Lena#1233: Okay, but what if the monster chasing you was a giant die coming to ruin all your tabletop hopes and dreams?
 Ell#3559: hah, everyone knows REAL real game devs put everything off until the last possible second and barely manage to release the game 😎
 sushiman#4823: i have anny ideas T-T
 Mystical_Pidgeon#1588: sokoban but you have to move dice blocks so the right number is facing up?
 Fnessa#8531: got an idea, going 3d this time. i'm scared.
 xqrd#4298: i have lots of cool ideas so yes 🙂
 redseiko#0001: I wrote this:
> Dice is a metaphor for life, the game is about realizing everything is by random chance and good things happen to bad people and vice-versa and then the meaninglessness of life and the futility of it all
 Zayed#7379: Ludo?
 Astrow#4496: LOOTBOX SIMULATOR!!!!!
 LambdaPyro#6782: Part of me wants to think outside the box, but then again I do only have 48-50 hours
 Starch_Supreme#4835: final build:                                                                thanks for playing!
 Cyndaquil#2646: You steel my ideia😂
 DarkFluo#1049: yo any one got their ideas ? I don't want to know what they are, just if anyone is already there. I myself are starting to get really good ideas, I hope y'all will be getting some too 😉
 aiursrage2k#2480: 🐸
 krisis in a jar#0904: i want to make a puzzle game but i don't know how to make a puzzle based on luck...
 Morg#8585: final build
^ look! i've got it!
 x²#7515: It **was** but javascript/unityscript was removed some time ago
 vilet918#8645: Just saw the theme announcement idea phase go brrrrrrrrrr
 Jellogramming#4653: speaking facts right here
 emaker#2708: tetris with dices
 theChief#0001: It was, but it doesn't exist now 😂
 TheGameShePlays#7762: I'm approaching "roll of the dice" in the metaphorical narrative sense 😅
 Tracer#7901: Mark i don't even have an idea yet 😭
 Pangords#8020: not anymore
 SaadTheGlad#9716: ikr smh
 LightLeviathan#1443: oh my god my brain is melting right now     also isn't unityscript basically js
 Astrow#4496: I can't even start working till 1 and a half hours from now you are better of than someone
 Jhunter#4054: I’m sorry mark
 Cyndaquil#2646: Theb just start there the rest should come eventually
 FryDev#0372: this is a difficult theme, agh
 Zayed#7379: XD
 6746#9763: I think the video having an actual playing dice in it just prompts everyone to think of the same definition of dice
 39#6748: i have many ideas but they are poop, i hate myself
 redseiko#0001: Wait what, I can use Javascript to make unity games?
 Mark Brown#6982: it's been half an hour, if you haven't got a final build yet are you even a real game dev
 Selviam#7268: same here!
 Pyth0n#0572: THIS IS CHAOS
 Jellogramming#4653: I want to make a game where you can get different dice that can be better or worse in some situations but I don't know what the rest should be
 theChief#0001: You cannot do this any more, JavaScript was removed!
 xqrd#4298: i actually like the theme beacuse it gives me many cool ideas 😄
 Dabt#7840: i didnt do anything, and i gotta go out now
 x²#7515: you can't anymore
 Astrow#4496: It's still not a very ideagenic theme which is the troubling part for me
 EzeTxle#5663: man unity is not loading bruh
 LightLeviathan#1443: so i was going to use xcode + swift wasm (i was making games with that before) but i realized you could use javascript to make unity games
 Ceding Tree#1081: 30 minutes gone....have I been productive............ANXIETY ++++
 39#6748: just use github copilot duh
 Cheese#8160: Idk what engine you're using but I guarantee its like a 4 second google away to find out how to add randomness. It's probably just `Math.random()` and then doing an if statement with the result.
 MrBen#0001: any ideas?
 Sid Vicious#9721: true
 OrangeKingdom#9769: what, man you should do that before
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: English in this server thank you
 theChief#0001: You can make something with random generation pretty easily! It doesn't have to be the most interesting, unique, wonderful implementation of the theme and **__this is not a competition__** - feel free to interpret it however you like!
 6746#9763: the problem is that no matter how good an idea i think off, there's always a better one, and im sure of it
 Cyndaquil#2646: Noice
 xqrd#4298: im gonna save that idea beacuse i like it 🙂
 bird uwu#4471: bruhh
 harper#8662: bruhhh vscode intellisense not working on the day of the jam
 smearyto#3143: WHY NOW????
 Astrow#4496: I don't know rng yet
 epicman#3996: extremely based french person
 redseiko#0001: You didn't install it... earlier?
 LightLeviathan#1443: OMFG UNITY IS FAILING TO INSTALL BRUH
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: knock it off
 Dabt#7840: im already doing as small as i can, AI in a tile based game is gonna be hard
 Scolon#4218: Alright time to start developing, finished fleshing out my idea. This should be easy.
 MangoWorks#1202: ok my team has an idea
 Cheese#8160: If there wasn't a theme, what would you make? Just make that game and you can shove some RNG into it.
 aiursrage2k#2480: every x seconds the dice rolls, the arerna changes lava rises if 1, etc
 Vabenil#5485: I think the theme is open enough, you can basically make anything that uses randomness
 Lothrien#9092: Good luck, all!  ❤️
 Madolah#8716: j'ne sais pas. Francais et Magnifique ( Pour Moi just SHITE at it)
But please dont gatekeep someone, who knows more languages than you asking to make their time to be more enjoyable here ❤️
 Jasper#7906: Just start small with something that's fun but has fewer options. And then you can add stuff from there, but you'll always have a game, even if you do not finish all your ideas
 Gumy#7061: Problem with using dice literally is that it’s all based on RNG which isn’t great from a game design standpoint
 Mystical_Pidgeon#1588: I'm thinking something like yhatzee + breakout/tetris
 elikrisel#7409: think you can take me?!
 MistTree#0001: agh im so lost on ideas
 MassedUp#8420: I recommend having some sort of skill to win or progress instead of pure randomness as it may be frustrating or unplayable
 Hobusu#5033: ~~have you tried leveling them up~~ (Xenoblade joke, ignore me)
 Cyndaquil#2646: Its really creative
 tcvm#0019: oh my idea just clicked im so excited
 Astrow#4496: Yeah I'm going to do a different game jam at this point this theme isn't very begginer friendly
 Intedai#9642: yo this is hard
 6746#9763: based, just tell people to shut up.
 Radiant#8453: IDEA :  A dice has 6 numbers basically 3 even and 3 odd numbers so a random simulator where you choose a side odd or even and depending on what comes you win or lose
 Tornado#0975: My arts terrible ugh
 x²#7515: Try to start with a simple idea, and expand on that, like tree of ideas
 OrangeKingdom#9769: My idea: everything based on luck, but you can win the game without the luck but if you lucky then you can win easily
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: someone anwser so shut up and good luck !
 Dabt#7840: im doing my idea, but i think im overscopping with with plans i have
idk if ill finish
 8-Bit duck#4223: I making a game with a casino heist with weapons determined by a dice
 xqrd#4298: game where you make food but the dice roll determines how fresh the food is but idk if this is a good idea
 Cheese#8160: Lmfao, I thought of that too. Its just like duel monsters.
 shuhai#8582: I think dice can be associated with cheat
 FéliXD#4922: I'm ideasn't please help.
 MassedUp#8420: i just had a EUREKA!!! moment, got my game idea
 Lin#5169: I quit, the theme is too hard for me
 aflyingpotato#7521: Def gonna be watching the dungeon dice monsters arc during my breaks this weekend
 krisis in a jar#0904: he has finished a game already
 Jasper#7906: Except which direction you go is still skill-based. So are things like when you take other actions. I see plenty of directions you could take that without it being pure RNG
 Hannes#5054: hi
 Astrow#4496: If no one responds probably no one so you should probably stop asking before mods notice
 AJM-03#3713: This is my first jam and I am really struggling for ideas, any tips?
 Madolah#8716: Literally, just adapt a board game like snakes & Ladders, Sorry, or one of the 500 games you played as kids into a Vidyea gaem
 MrBen#0001: give me ideas please 😭
 LightLeviathan#1443: WAIT PHANTOM DUST BUT WITH D20
 x²#7515: I think he is lol
 Ber#3410: it just started
 Matthew Dadoun#4950: he is lol
 6746#9763: mark should make a game, he knows alot about them.
 quantum#0043: first open photoshop open unity sit for 4 hours blah blah blah
 Dabt#7840: its stupid because its completly luck based and there is no skill involved
 krisis in a jar#0904: give me ideas so i can copy them
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: who is french here ?
 Jellogramming#4653: hopefully I don't overscope like I've done in every other jam I've been in
 Astrow#4496: Maybe I'll just make a metroidvania and attach a dice to the players head
 No_Namer007#8260: i got this idea from another idea in here, but i was thinking to make a game where theres a player with a weapon and a dice determines your damage or health
 AlpacaKing#0195: That sounds like an amazing idea! Good luck with it
 voithos#0258: SAME
 LightLeviathan#1443: mark is probably laughing at how freaked out everyone is haha
 Scolon#4218: I think I have my idea, I really like the direction this is going in
SOUNDTRACK TO THE WEEKEND
 Ceding Tree#1081: just sayin, milanote is a great way to organize your ideas if you are trying to find where to start
 Jasper#7906: That sounds much more awesome than stupid
 _Javi_#7149: here's an idea: RNGesus is an actual deity that you feed sacrifices in order to increase your chances in RNG situations
 MassedUp#8420: just 27 minutes late
 Micky Pruney#3075: Dungeon dice monsters
 OrangeKingdom#9769: Ok, Finally have an idea
Let's see can I make it before the deadline 😅
 Zoro5168#0115: Me watching marks video on randomness so that i can make a game about randomness for his game jam
 Gumy#7061: Nope
 Matthew Dadoun#4950: is it too late to join the jam
 Starch_Supreme#4835: wish you all the very best. Scratch is a great place to start for new developers :)
 Dabt#7840: i had a stupid idea , and i think im going to do it, first person horror game with tile based movement where both u and the monster roll the dice to decide how my spaces they can move
 Cyndaquil#2646: An unfair advantage lol
 Vasko#4044: I was thinking of making a rogue like but that's like a 90% chance I won't finish it
 Selviam#7268: is the bounce material good to use on a player or is that something i should code in?
 gopyboi#5154: what do i do
 LightLeviathan#1443: being a dungeon master rn is a huge advantage lol
 quantum#0043: finally!!! got an idea
 Jellogramming#4653: I had the same idea but more of an open world game
 ZedDev#4726: I'm gonna make a roguelike but a single room, you launch a dice at stuff and it deals a random damage range depending on the dice
 Ber#3410: unity takes to long to open ok and ive never even used it before im new to gamejams
 Morg#8585: this has a really cool reverse katamari sound to it, i hope someone uses the idea!
 theChief#0001: You don't need to upload a WebGL game, particularly for Unity WebGL has some _significant_ drawbacks:
- limited audio API
- no compute shaders, which means no VFX graph
- frequent post-processing bugs
- no hardware acceleration, which means performance can really suck unless people specifically enable it 
**__Don't worry if your game doesn't work on WebGL__**. Plenty of people will still play it! You'll just need to put a bit of effort into your cover and short description
 Astrow#4496: I wish the gamejam theme was more easily implementable, I know people are saying you can take it anyway, but you can take anything anyway and that doesn't mean it's good
 TheGameShePlays#7762: I have a good idea but I think I need to learn some new codey things, I haven't tried this one before
 KimTheMightyChim#0685: stiop thinking about it involving a dice and think more about something randomized and you'll start getting ideas
 dgsqef#2005: you need python
 EzeTxle#5663: yes
 Selviam#7268: dice battle royal
 6746#9763: Idea: a game  where you play as a dice, moving rolls you and depending on what number you land on, a random action happens like spawning an enemy or getting a boost or something
 PowerZox#5241: if the player needs the IDE to run it no you cant
 vide0gamer#5404: a little bit
 OrangeKingdom#9769: Ok guys, Now I got an ide
Let's see how to make a dice roll system 🎲
 Jasper#7906: That's cool. I like dice way too much not to go a more literal way, but I'd definitely want to play an interpretation like that!
 zyugyzarc#0314: exe
 maxbox360#7946: I'm not in it this year but I imagine a 3D person deal where the player is inside a die, Getting Over It style, and when they attack the die becomes a physics objects and whatever it lands on it does some amount of damage
 Rav#3300: there are sites on the gamejam page where you can get art for free, just go there, under "I need art and audio!"
 Radiant#8453: Interesting idea
 xriva#0378: Does anyone have ideas?
 Starch_Supreme#4835: ah yes, finally someone with the intelligence to use such sophisticated software 🔥
 Ishmhora#8802: DnD devs go.
 KingZoola#7835: AHHHHHHHH I have no idea what ünigue" thing i can do
 LightLeviathan#1443: kinda like the sonic unleashed werehog stages except shorter and the die roll is rng for how much damage you do             also i'm using unity/unityscript
 Ber#3410: i just realized somebody could make a dnd game
 Tapu#9161: That actually works and can be turned into something
 Morg#8585: anyone using twine this year?
 TheGameShePlays#7762: OpenGameArt has a lot for free
 No_Namer007#8260: interesting....
 KimTheMightyChim#0685: i'm using unreal. it said you can use anything you want really
 dgsqef#2005: can i upload a python game to the jam or do i need to convert it to exe
 LOPSTERu#3902: im just making what my only idea is
 MaJeeDooo0010#5707: A game where YOU are the dice?
 Jellogramming#4653: it doesn't need to be good, some games get away with a square as the player
 Z2D#3320: My idea - You roll for all yours stats, but if you roll a one on a stat that stat get reset
 hackel#9932: unity!
 Selviam#7268: you could think about DND when trying to figure out how to make dice fun
 REDbird#8434: I got 2 ideas and I need a 3rd one because the first two are meh
 Will.#5581: Game Title Idea: *Die* Hard
 dQw4w9WgXcQ#8475: I'm gonna go outside and try to think of something I'm not getting anywhere at my laptop
 Lena#1233: What if the game world is a rolling die and you're on top of it
 MikhailABCD#9579: it said you can use any engine
 OrangeKingdom#9769: Unity
 ZedDev#4726: I need a 2D character but i can't draw or make pixel art 😦
 Rav#3300: my team uses unity, i basically only make pixel art lol, i use Aseprite
 Reemus#7953: Hey Lena, I totally identify with your description, game designer trying to become a narrative one.
 PowerZox#5241: easiest theme ever just make something based on rng (90% of games today anyway)
 Radiant#8453: Unity
 tcvm#0019: Right now i'm workshopping an idea of some choice you have to make, one that will leave you better/worse off and its your choice which decides; the hard part is figuring out the choice lol
 No_Namer007#8260: i have no idea what to make
 SpellCast#5277: unity
 Ber#3410: im using scratch
 MassedUp#8420: i have like alot of ideas but they all hiding in the back of my head, i got 3 ideas rn
 MaJeeDooo0010#5707: So uuh, I'm not gonna be able to join This year's Jam.
 LOPSTERu#3902: man i have no idea what to make
 farkon00#0500: Used unity last year. Want to try godot thisjam
 Kdev#5702: unity
 Jácint [Slava Ukraini 🇺🇦]#7098: godot
 shuhai#8582: Godot
 MrBen#0001: anyone give me game idea pls
 Zutilt10 | Jonathan. W#0339: Unity
 Davgoxd#1219: game maker studio 2
 Jellogramming#4653: unity
 GamerBath#0667: make a game where you press a button and then it shows you a random number between 1 and 6 just like when you roll a dice 🙂
 Mew#7314: Im German and I'm looking for a German teammate. I can code but Im not sound/grafik artist. Private message please
 xqrd#4298: gdevelop 🙂
 Selviam#7268: Uniiiity 2D!

 Victorec#5051: unity
 Teslobo#8274: You recall right
 Starch_Supreme#4835: what engine are we all using? interested to know :D
 Dabt#7840: i have no clue wtf im doing
 OrangeKingdom#9769: My idea: everything depends on luck 🍀
 Sapient#3138: Really hard
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: If I recall this is already in the rules!
 Rav#3300: damn this theme is hard
 Ber#3410: 😭 i dont like the theme i cant think or do anything
 Space_Masters#5625: I'm thinking like you dice some vegetables and see them roll away
 Reemus#7953:  Sorry for the tag, but a suggestion - make an announcement in Please read that developers are encouraged to upload their game as a web-build in the first place, so the most people play it.
 MassedUp#8420: that was one of my ideas lol
 Jeker#3389: Ok I have an idea
 klettari#3498: ok but this made me think of clicking on links not knowing if it's gonna be a rickroll or not, and if it is you lose
 Firepixel85#0733: never gonna let you down
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Please don't talk about the theme being "annoying" or similar things. It's not going to be everyone's taste every year. There's still interesting things you can do with and and it can be interpreted in any way you choose.
 Jasper#7906: yep, must be playable in a browser or on windows, which that satisfies
 CodeIGuess#8220: Remember: _Dice is both plural and singular, while Die is only singular!_
 Lena#1233: Then make it simple. "Roll the die" doesn't need to be interpreted as some complicated RNG. Personally, I'm exploring the idea of a platformer where the player is a die
 shuhai#8582: never gonna give you up
 Gurki#9176: We're all jammie dodgers now
 Pyth0n#0572: mark brown has pleased rngesus
 MaJeeDooo0010#5707: Hey guys!

 Cheese#8160: I genuinely love it lmao
 Ber#3410: im making my game in scratch but i have 0 clue what would be good for scratch
 OrangeKingdom#9769: I got an idea 🎉
 Astrow#4496: That's kind of a stretch
 Chamasssa#2341: Just a web build is plenty good enough right?
 Quinnster#8573: I just got an idea where the dice are obstacles in a level and when you touch one it applies a random attribute either good or bad
 Pyth0n#0572: my idea: 10 turn game where you and an opponent decide to stand or roll a dice, roll an odd number, score goes down, roll even, score goes up, highest score at the end wins
 RayZor#8982: nope
 Reemus#7953: Game idea for everyone - you roll the DICE (game company behind Battlefrield series) show how it perishes, rolls over and stops being a cool company. A social meta commentary, a very creative take on the theme?
 BeegUnr'O'el#0837: are you artist?
 Cheese#8160: JavaScript gang JavaScript gang JavaScript gang
 Tracer#7901: i had an idea to make a casino game where you catch people cheating in games, but its way too far out of my scope so yall can have it
 Chris10EMX#5180: UE5 has decided to give me its middle finger and crash when I create a new project
 Selviam#7268: my thought now is to code a genetic system but uhhh it *miiight* be too advanced for me
 MangoWorks#1202: my game is basically luck be land lord as a survival game
 Astrow#4496: I'll try
 TheChronicPhenix#1205: Man this theme just makes me think of Lost in Random, pretty great and underrated recent release
 Ber#3410: i was gonna try that
 Chamasssa#2341: Well, i've got my idea all set up...
But theres no way i can build this in construct after all...
Guess we are programming this hardcore in javascript...
 Is.aac#1185: dm me ideas yall - please
 CodingLord#1012: I want to make something that is simple to make BUT THE THEME is so complicated
 stylo#0920: what you need? u are programmer ?
 A_#0722: gonna make a lootbox simulator 💯

 KonStick66#5147: Yeah, you right
 Finboror#8230: anyone wanna brainstorm, my dms are open
 OrangeKingdom#9769: I got an idea, but need more improvement
 Mew#7314: I find no team mate. everyone is in a big group but nobody would split in two to team with me. 😦
 Reemus#7953: Guys a game idea for the bravest of you
 Cashwarrior1#9970: make a game where you push a block to solve puzzles and the block is a dice :)
 Foptciy#4956: watch out; its 50 hours
 RayZor#8982: this theme is so annoying
 Scolon#4218: I have a few ideas but I'm going to keep thinking before I start

 Ceding Tree#1081: Guys, I'm going Mario party style dice rolls if that inspires anyone
 MangoWorks#1202: i have 5 themes that i have to implement into my game
 Fusoy#6101: We'll probably be making more video game with die during 48 hours than there is already in this whole planet
 Astrow#4496: Can you make teams after the game jam starts? Idk how to make 2D models
 BrokenCalculator#2386: i've got an idea which might not be the best but sounds fun so im just gonna go with it
 Cheese#8160: Are you asking if the 5000 year old game of chess is copyright-free?
 xqrd#4298: cool idea
 Ber#3410: should i make a board game type thing
 Banana202#6324: Time to make HOORRROOOR
 Selviam#7268: maybe you could roll for enemy generation too and health
 null_ham#2050: i really dont like this theme tbh
 Jasper#7906: definitely is, just needs to be playable on a computer
 stylo#0920: hey do someone need a 3d artist for the jam there ?
 Radiant#8453: same here
 |[ Fatal ]|#5771: this is the first time i alr have an idea \:D
 Tornado#0975: ahhhhhhg I am not finding that great of ideas
 RayZor#8982: yes
 shemokam#6028: Good luck everyone, i hope everyone will have a blast!
 Morg#8585: i thought the review channel didn't open until the jam was over?
 budderdogzandcat#8514: is making a chess like game legal?
 Gui77302011#2574: I have no idea of what to do
 Astrow#4496: Idk how and I don't think I can learn in 2 days
 Ber#3410: 😭 i have no ideas
 DarkMagus#2884: Well I really there are great possibilities
 xqrd#4298: how about a dungeon crawler but every time you enter a room or a boss fight you roll the dice and depending on what you get your weapons get randomised
 Starch_Supreme#4835: you're amazing
 Itooh#5008: now actually considering adding cheese dices in my game…
 OrangeKingdom#9769: can you tell me, I am not going to copy
 Viola_Buddy#6763: Dice Escape, that was what it was, if anyone needs the name to look it up for inspiration
 Z2D#3320: what dice should I use d6, d8, d12, or d20
 Selviam#7268: the idea i have now can be summed up as: tomogachi? tomodicey
 shuhai#8582: good luck everyone
 AzE#0001: I've already got an idea pog
 meowberry#1859: Vasuka
 THE_MX0004#2535: i did it i have an idea
 keb#6637: draw one yourself
 zeidXD#0210: this is hype
 BrokenCalculator#2386: ok what do you guys think of this idea:
you have to defend a flag at the top of a mountain from enemies climbing up to the top and you drop dice on them which roll a random number when they collide. the higher the number the more damage is done but also that enemy gets faster
 shemokam#6028: I want to make a game where the dice has icons instead of numbers, that would be fun🤔
 Astrow#4496: Oh man how am I going to find a free 2d dice model with arms and animations
 Starch_Supreme#4835: TIME TO MAKE A 2D SIDE SCROLLER SIUUU
 Viola_Buddy#6763: Some sort of dominoes-style gameplay involving matching sides of a dice to each other is also possible if you don't want randomness. There was a Neopets Flash game involving flipping a die over its edge repeatedly, trying to roll it slowly into a goal, with the correct orientation.
 LightHouse#2571: What about something that depends on odds with science, we can make something related to quantum mechanics. It's the absolute randomness in physics
 Tornado#0975: AHH MAKING A LUDO WILL BE TOO OBVIUS RIGHT??
 Selviam#7268: Things that go with roll of the dice - Lady luck, its an idiom that means something is good or bad, gambling games and dice can mean to finely chop somethingg
 Morg#8585: dice gun.
 Astrow#4496: Dice with gun dice with gun!
 HopeMetal#0586: I'm taking the theme literally but using something that is somewhat related to dice instead of actual dice aaaaaa slowmodeeeeeeee timeeee
 ILOST#2645: i got the idea of a dice sokoban
 Abolfazl_11#0446: I hope best of luck for evryone. I think i can't participate in this jam cause I'm really busy these days😢
 RyqShaw#7249: me: this is an amazing theme
also me: my god there is not such thing as a good idea
 OrangeKingdom#9769: only 48 hours, I need to come up with an idea
 Ceding Tree#1081: mario party dice rolls for 64 seemed rng, but werent
 Radiant#8453: The theme is pretty unique but that means coming up with a idea would be harder
 FryDev#0372: man this is hard
 Tornado#0975: I gotta think of an idea
 Astrow#4496: What about dice rolling how can you implement dice rolling that isn't rng
 HopeMetal#0586: Dice but you replace the numbers with something else
 wren#0640: ok thought of something fuck yes
 SpellCast#5277: the theme is interesting
 Jhunter#4054: inconceivable
 Hobusu#5033: That would be fine (though I don't know how popular it would end up being), just making it clear that actual microtransactions are banned!
 IvanezRustledJimmies#8685: Rick Diceley
 THE_MX0004#2535: i work a double shift tmrw 😦
 Chamasssa#2341: I keep coming back to a pretty litteral interpretation...
Rolling "dice" blocks around in a puzzle game.
Just not sure how im gonna be making that fun just yet...
 BlahBlahBlue#4023: lol Have fun everyone! I'll try to participate but college is a thing I gotta do
 williamdoro#8857: here is an idea : RANDOM
 6746#9763: 20 hours of the jam is gonna go into brainstorming, I already know it.
 Turquoise#2894: there really should have been an @ everyone announcement here lol
 Conrado#5963: you could have a char that is a dice, you could have a board game, you could base your game on randomness, a lot of things
 MrBen#0001: u joking
 OrangeKingdom#9769: Have you guys got an idea
 Tornado#0975: Hmm
 BluEagle#4805: ideas come in very easy, though executing them is the hardest part
 MaryStrawberry#4672: mwahaha, I think I got an idea!
 Selviam#7268: thank you for reminding me of this also dice means to chop something finely
 Zoro5168#0115: In-game currency lootboxes
 Gorochu#2605: Okay thank you!
Also I do think that this year's theme is EXTREMELY interesting. RNG theme
 Morg#8585: oh my god.
 Ellis#1417: I have a good idea now at least good theme
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Please make a ragdoll rick astley you throw on a game board and he has dots on different parts of his body. Just do it.
 Astrow#4496: I mean it's not but what else do you use dice for
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i personally already have an idea i'm just rewatching the video about randomness mark made to fully realize it
 pShr#9482: ROLL OF THE DICE DAMN
 ImZary#0765: yeah ofc but just wondering (aka, double submissions ig)
 redseiko#0001: "God does not play dice with the universe." -- Albert Einstein
 Lavra source#3802: no, why?
 Banana202#6324: I think you still can, just check the website
 Tapu#9161: Move to shoot but you roll like a dice 🎲
 tcvm#0019: "roll of the dice" is also an idiom meaning "somethign that can be good or bad"
 MassedUp#8420: time to open paint and make ideas
 TheTopOfTheHat#8679: Couldn't you use the verb dice and say "Roll of the dice-*d onions*?
 farkon00#0500: My genius ideas be like: Rick Astley, but dice. You roll rick
 Jhunter#4054: true lol. I have some ideas but I feel like they’re a little too common so we’ll see
 Jasper#7906: You just need one or more dice and they need to roll. Nobody said you need to be rolling for the result and do something with that.
 Redline#7370: bc yes
 SLiV#5820: How many people making an RPG ("role" of the dice)?
 stylo#0920: hey guys do someone need a 3D modeller for the jam ?
 SlamBamActionman#7160:  is the channel for you! 🙂
 Morg#8585: very happy to be using twine for this theme
 OrangoMango#0973: what if someone already submits an entry? lol
 Thefearalcarrot#5679:  progress pics is for pics, to answer your question!
 Rendaven#7909: well you can, roll of dice can basically means luck
 SlamBamActionman#7160: That might be the reason why people think the game is hard! Lots of possibilities
 meowberry#1859: meowberry
 ConstantDerivative#6302: probably just better to make a new game
 Jácint [Slava Ukraini 🇺🇦]#7098: actually from what i heard you first need a stage of intense focus and brain storming to get your brain rolling, and then after that the iedas will flow naturally when you don't focus on it
 Gorochu#2605: Hi, sorry if this question is already answered but can we still sign up?
 karine28#2174: looking for some developer. I have an idea for the game, but no dev background. I could help with ideas and art 
 Max - Winteractive#9512: Strange that with all this time to prepare a theme with the hopes of the community creating a wide variety of games - that the theme had a noun in it.   I am sceptical
 BlahBlahBlue#4023:  Flip a ragdoll instead of dice! lol idk | the best ideas won't be said
 ImZary#0765: the theme is **literally** a game me and a friend of mine made in 48 h for a jam
*wait, can i just submit that-*
 Lavra source#3802: no, move to shoot
 Arfilish#8729: My settings menu code is messy as hell
 Alexio#0022: yo dude can i steal this?
 Veqsa#8120: Why are people saying this theme is hard? (like u  )
i mean... roll the dice can be seen as so many things
 6746#9763: the theme is "roll of THE dice" so you can't get away with not having a dice in it
 DarkMagus#2884: There will be great game, the theme is awesome
 MrBen#0001: bruh I have no idea
 THE_MX0004#2535: SAME!!!!!!!!!!
 CodeIGuess#8220: profile picture checks out
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: don't worry I'm not actually taking part! (because it wouldn't be fair obv)
 SquidGeneral10#4090: listen to Bruce Springsteen - Roll of the Dice
 BluEagle#4805: ooh this is a really really good theme
 KonStick66#5147: We don't have directions, which dice, how many sides it haves and what it determines. We don't even need roll result, just the roll itself
 Jhunter#4054: Any banger ideas yet
 AzE#0001: yes I have an idea
 Peshoddd#9446: you can make a minecraft mod out of this
 Selviam#7268: if you force the idea your gonna stress yourself good ideas flow in naturally

 Ceding Tree#1081: hey peeps, dont be afraid to take a chance and ROLL THE DICE with your game ideas
 Starch_Supreme#4835: hey guys i'm new, someone said there would be jam here, where is it?
 Lavra source#3802: I have an idea for a game - a top-down shooter, where u replenish your ammo by rolling yourself, which also acts as a dash. and u play as a dice
 Ice ZeeKay#7335: 10 minutes out of 50 hours, ppl want to get their ideas down quick to star workng
 BlahBlahBlue#4023: just make dungeons and dragons pro
 ALilyByAnyName#6421: Roll of the dice is a common metaphor, idk I don't think y'all *need* literal dice
 Vasko#4044: mod bias 😬
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: here's a hint: mark made a video talking about rng go watch that
 Teslobo#8274: As we speak I have already taken 18 of the top 20 spots
 xriva#0378: I have no ideas
 CodingLord#1012: Another idea: Shooter/Platformer but you move according to the dice
 xqrd#4298: i was thinking of every 10 sec or more you roll the dice and depending on the number you get a random effect
 Morg#8585: the most powerful one of us yet
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: dunno what you lot are doing
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: I've literally already made 3 jam winning entries
 Selviam#7268: ppl be complaining not even 10 minutes into the jam that they cant think of the most mind blowing top 20 game yeeeeet
 Fusoy#6101: Also, dice do not always have 6 faces, there's much to do with that
 vide0gamer#5404: im going to make a shooter
 6746#9763: Shoot to move of the dice
 Hobusu#5033: The two often go hand-in-hand, so I wanted to make that 100% clear; as long as you don't do microtransactions it'll probably be fine, but microtransactions are banned
 Starch_Supreme#4835: don't care, making a top down shooter
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: vien mp ?
 CodeIGuess#8220: brain on low battery, idk what else to do
 Jasper#7906: gonna do macrotransactions?

 Ice ZeeKay#7335: my brain is just paused rn omg i can't come up with anything unique
 swarm#1128: don't care, doing shoot to move
 Jarten#4513: If u don't get an idea this quickly, dwell on it for a bit and don't hate the theme
 6746#9763: Yeah, I was saying that you might need to have like a dice sprite in the game or just generally a dice. so we're gonna be seeing very similar game graphics that way.
 M_Raven#4076: REMINDER: Roll Of The Dice doesn't need to mean you need to incorporate RNG
 Selviam#7268: a ball with letters on it?
 CodingLord#1012: What of like, the player is the dice and you control the board game. THATS IT
 Teslobo#8274: Give it an hour or so to sink in and people will come up with some pretty out there ideas
 ConstantDerivative#6302: what is the opposite of dice
 Jarmister#8896: How he would test lootboxes of 10 mln games
 Vabenil#5485: Don't think so, thousands of ideas are flowing through my brain right now
 Axiomvp#1628: some one has beeen watching to much stranger things 😛
 Astrow#4496: Balls

 BrokenCalculator#2386: im thinking of making a digital board game
 solid man#1309: dice?? what dice 🧐

 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: who is french ?
 LilUziHurt#3684: Roll of the dice also just communicates to "Chance"
 Ayden#0303: i think everyone in this jam is gonna have the exact same idea as me
 Avdo#9883: so many possibilities that needs more thinking to be solid
 Hobusu#5033: Mark has explicitly banned microtransactions

 Zoro5168#0115: GIVE US IDEAS
 Vasko#4044: I have 0 ideas
 6746#9763: I think roll of the dice makes it so that you NEED to have dice in whatever game you're making. Maybe "roll of the X" would've been better.
 Foonguz#5624: Y’all be hating the theme until the top 20 drop where y’all see all the possibilities

 gamedevperson#8448: Defo
 Shroomax#3378: Isn't that every coding forum ever? Like it has been since the beginning of time?l
Long before time had a name, a genius created stackoverflow without stackoverflow, truly remarkable feat for the human kind
 myRobotArms#3600: gamesfromscratch has a good video about the unity news on youtube

 SlamBamActionman#7160: Countdowns in !
 gopyboi#5154: 10
 Shroomax#3378: 11:55 AM
 ProtoXV#2705: Unity is still a perfectly fine engine to be fair, it remains to be seen whether any unwanted/malicious stuff actually makes its way into the engine
 dash#7786: nearly 5am gaming over here
 Cunnah#9270: the kind of person who spams on streams must be the kind of person who passed out at christmas over the excitement
 Gorv#9326: 4m
 myRobotArms#3600: Been using Unity for 6 years and I'm using Godot this weekend personally. I just worry for the future of Unity. TBF, I have dabbled in a bit of Godot in the past because the open source aspect interests me and the Unity stuff just helped push me into it's open source arms
 bit#7212: i used godot last game jam i did but idk really just wasnt for me
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: 17:54
 uberBuilder24#0536: "Hippity Hoppity your code is now my property"
 Casterra#7763: 1pm
 Zutilt10 | Jonathan. W#0339: Wait what's happening with Unity?
 ryan123#4605: the stride game engine is really good and open source
 OrangoMango#0973: 18:54
 Gurki#9176: fsdfsdfgsdfg Good luck y'all
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Welp I gtg. Take care! I'll see what the theme is in a couple of hours.
 Lavra source#3802: What time is it for u guys?
 rhythm heaven monkey#9052: godot is really neat and also makes me irrationally angry whenever it doesn't have a feature that unity has
 Chamasssa#2341: I completely managed to miss that premiere.., thanks
 Peter#0007: honestly best outcome at this point would be a spin-off of the game engine component (pre-merger it only made up 31% of revenue iirc)
 Casper#6361: Good luck everyone
 nizbel#9979: Amen
 Jonathor#1971: sad, i dont really wanna change from unity to unreal since i dont really wanna learn a new game engine and unity is very beginner friendly
 FryDev#0372: it’s going to be two words, and be vague
 BrokenCalculator#2386: i heard the news about unity very recently, so i can't switch engines for this jam but next jam i probably will
 BadPiggy#5202: Time to jam peeps
 Drachma86#4517: For anyone stressed for their first time, I'm sure you'll enjoy it even if you don't finish on deadline.
 gamedevperson#8448: they're just spamming E and nothing else
 golds#3845: they are also acquiring WETA from what I heard
 Selviam#7268: Everyone take their best theme guess before it starts my guess is LOOP
 Shroomax#3378: unity answers is a really good forum, shame that they even considered to shut it down
 Scolon#4218: I don't see a real reason to switch from Unity atm tbh
 Gorv#9326: it starts in six minutes and i already feel late...
 IHateBeetz#0939: I'm running Godot4 as well, but depending on how much time I have, I can help others with music/sound
 Zutilt10 | Jonathan. W#0339: Almost time
 Zayed#7379: Why tho
 Dabt#7840: that live chat is a cesspoll of cringe ngl
 myRobotArms#3600: They merged with an Ad and Analytics company (who have been known to be shady) and are now essentially an Ad and Analytics company with a game engine. Plus they laid off a lot of people. There are some good videos with coverage on youtube
 Changeisontwitch#9198: 6 minutesssss
 JuliusCube#8501: and?
 Mrinin#2181: I doubt most people will change, unity is still really friendly for indies
and besides, they canceled their unity answers cancellation so they are at listening a bit
they may make bad decisions but I don't think they will bankrupt themselves
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Eugh.. I'm missing the theme reveal. iwi
 ProtoXV#2705: Some bad decisions from Unity management, unwanted mergers, weird offsensive statements from the CEO, layoffs, etc
 PepperBoi#4544: Unity bought an ad/malware company ironsource
 uberBuilder24#0536: Unity partnered up with IronSource.
 xqrd#4298: gl to you too 🙂
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: less than 2021

 Hecktic Games#3541: Its almost time
 golds#3845: on the itch page for the jam they have resources for music and SFX
 Eldinur#2586: That's really insane, isn't it?
 L3mmy♡#2307: Good luck to everyone! Have a great game jam!
 OrangoMango#0973: just refreshed the site, 20.2k -> 20.3k
 Jonathor#1971: what news?
 Selviam#7268: WOOWOO 7 more MIINUUUTES
 Zoro5168#0115: Phrase pairs well with pfp
 Mrinin#2181: so, spam
 aXtwork810#0577: My first jam after few months with Unity as well
 Catfish#2063: THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE UNDERTAKER TOLD JOHN CENA
 myRobotArms#3600: Can you imagine how many people are going to be using a new engine this game jam after the Unity news? lol
 Zayed#7379: Ur on their side
 PepperBoi#4544: I know but when I looked people were talking bout crab game and fart to move
 Acu1000#5560: 20.2K people
 Tob#1798: likewise
 uberBuilder24#0536: That's what I'm doing, I started learning Unity yesterday.
 ProtoXV#2705: I hope so! I'm using this as an excuse to get more familiar with godot 4 haha
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: im stressed
 xqrd#4298: i wonder if itch.io is gonna break on the last hours of the jam
 rhythm heaven monkey#9052: i will finish my game on time by not making music or sound effects
i'm mostly just too shy to find teammates
 golds#3845: its my first time so I am nervous!
 IHateBeetz#0939: Game jams are the perfect way to learn a new engine, so your argument is opposite 😄
 Lavra source#3802: it's 1 am right now for me lol
 Chamasssa#2341: 48 hours is enough if you keep the scope clear
 OrangoMango#0973: spam chat
 Mrinin#2181: It's for spam
 Drachma86#4517: Horrendously. But it was fun!
 Giga chad#0085: Wdym
 PepperBoi#4544: Wtf is 
 Cunnah#9270:   you should try it. Do it on twitch and then it will be like open mic night "Learn guitar in front of a live audience" 😉
 MistTree#0001: just 11 minutes, that pretty cool
 uberBuilder24#0536: 48 hours isn't enough, I've learned...
 ProtoXV#2705: Hi, y'all!
 CodeIGuess#8220: i thought this was a 72 hour jam so i'm really nervous that it's 48😅
 JuliusCube#8501: well its not a good idea to trust 100 bored game devs with anything so continue preventing people from counting down in general i guess
 Wurmloch#6224: its never too early!! Jams area great way to learn
 golds#3845: howd ya do?
 MrBen#0001: no
 IHateBeetz#0939: Accidentally saw it, I just watch his game design videos once in a while 😄
 Zigordion#3748: do you have to put the gmtk logo in your game jam game?
 Catfish#2063:  I'M WATCHING U...
 Drachma86#4517: GMTK 2019 was my first jam, and here I am yet again
 CoolRyan#6539: when do i offically become a game dev, when i click join on the jam or when i submit my game, pls help
 Neossir#4982: I'd love to join but I just started learning Unity, it's too early for me. Next one!
 xqrd#4298: first time doing a 48h game jam after doing a game in 3h for the trjiam
 Dannycopo#1825: hello all
 MistTree#0001: 10.
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Countdowns in 
 Zoro5168#0115: Go to hype i think mark is dropping theme hints
 Shroomax#3378: i wonder if a bowl of corn flakes and coffee were a good idea
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Yup.
 Giga chad#0085: Hey! Quandale Dingle Here
 squeletteur#3172: good luck c: 
 golds#3845: same
 Dylapop#6375: This will be my first 48 hour jam 🙂
 Catfish#2063: hey guys
 Zayed#7379: Woah
Illegal
 JuliusCube#8501: so the mods are doing the countdown instead of us? huh
 darlingS#1797: It's 12 48 am
 ◈・ Altaꐟ#9999: adana kebab is the best choose for you're breakfast
 Itooh#5008: ouh, yes, please tag your game correctly when uploading them, for the folks like me who use the app! 😮 It's such a nice gain of time.
 OrangoMango#0973: yeah and also viewing the live
 Giga chad#0085: whats the time for u guys for me it is 6:48 pm
 Shroomax#3378: kebab is always a good idea. no matter the time
 Tob#1798: im starting to wonder if coffee was a good idea
 Scolon#4218: I'm surprised at how many people are joining this jam last minute
 IHateBeetz#0939: Neighbours should know for sure.
 Mrinin#2181: it's 8pm, so good morning
 Dylapop#6375: Hows everyone doing??
 SlamBamActionman#7160: I trust people can find the reveal if they need it 😉
 Cunnah#9270: I'm starting to wonder if a kebab for dinner was a good idea
 Morg#8585: yess exactly gotta make sure everyone in vicinity hears it, even when no one else is jamming
 rhythm heaven monkey#9052: well the best solution is to build your game for windows, mac, linux, webgl, which is not very hard if you choose an engine that isn't trash
 darlingS#1797: Good early-as-hell-in-the-morning everyone how y'all doing
 ◈・ Altaꐟ#9999: i think if you tag everyone in chat, everyone will be get hype more than this message
 ConstantDerivative#6302: a mod posted the link with the same id so it isnt a rickroll
 golds#3845: AYYYY kirby
 Peewi#8572: more like you're gonna get jumpscared by the incredibly loud Youtube premiere countdown
 OrangoMango#0973: maybe it could be a rickroll
 IHateBeetz#0939: This is a great idea, turning off music and blasting speakers
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: remember when hype regularly didn't get a message for 30+mins those were the days
 Scolon#4218: The theme will be announced literally everywhere, it is impossible to miss unless you actively try to miss it
 Morg#8585: i have the theme video open on my computer ready to play so im gonna get jumpscared by mark brown's voice in 15 minutes
 xqrd#4298: i feel like im gonna submit the game in the grace period beacuse itch.io wont let me submit the game
 Giga chad#0085: prob like everywhere
 Beeg scarf#3571: if i were you guys i would start preparing the menu screen
 Mrinin#2181: it crashed every year thus far, so, yes.
 DrWorrell#7667: most certainly
 rhythm heaven monkey#9052: yeah
 Tob#1798: 👍
 SlamBamActionman#7160: This is accurate
 ExMarcs#9048: Where will the reveal take place?
 TwoWholeWorms#8078: yes
 Aitesedbaن#6908: do you guys think itch.io is gonna crash this weekend?
 1DEDARY#1307: *summoned from another chat*
 Thorvald#1806: Last 15 minutes, time to go take my ice bath, mentally prepare myself
 golds#3845: I feel like the mods workload gets more and more the closer the game jam come to happening
 OrangoMango#0973: yeah
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: yeah there will be a huge influx the moment the jam starts
 Zoro5168#0115: I just lurked for an hour
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: 😉
 Scolon#4218: We're on 1 minute slowmode right now and messages are still coming out extremely fast. It's only going to get worse when the theme is announced
 SlamBamActionman#7160: 48 + 2 grace hours for submitting. Try to have your game finished before the 2 hour grace period!
 Mrinin#2181: for the itch app, it's better for it to have a windows version anyways
 IHateBeetz#0939: Gotcha gotcha. Apparently there's a time cap on messaging here?
 Aitesedbaن#6908: yoo  ur about me is actually supr cool u like improve skills in different categories
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Countdowns in  !
 golds#3845: :0
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: nah you're all great (mostly)
 Zoro5168#0115: Im back
 OrangoMango#0973: aren't they 50h?
 ◈・ Altaꐟ#9999: why am i understand that you are saying me stupid but youtube chatters are more stupider than me ?
 Tob#1798: dang not many ppl use gms2
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: No you can either do web or you can do a windows build but it must be playable on a windows computer in some way
 rhythm heaven monkey#9052: webgl is better because it's more convenient for non-windows users (also i can't for the life of me get wine working on my mac aaaaa)
 Morg#8585: they hide behind the cheese, maybe they have much more profound thoughts, and restrain their words with the excessive use of the cheese emoji

 PokeNinjaGuy#9592: typical youtube :smh:
 xqrd#4298: i use gdevelop also making thumbnails for me is one of the annoying parts for me
 Scolon#4218: The game has to be able to run in the browser OR natively on windows
Any other builds are not required
 IHateBeetz#0939: The Game Jam is 3 days until JUL18?
 GavRaz#6261: i got obs open, github, godot, aseprite, the stream, and osme other things, im good to go
 Dylapop#6375: Can i make it to where you have to download the unity project???
 Shroomax#3378: in 2days nevetheless
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: because youtube chatters are somehow stupider than you lot
 PepperBoi#4544: Webgl or windows
 Dabt#7840: aight cool, just wanted to ask because smaller files are easier to download
 Tapu#9161: They wanna be cheezy
 golds#3845: no
 BurnV06#5857: same
 Giga chad#0085: question, Does the game HAVE to be WebGL
 rhythm heaven monkey#9052: guys can i manually huffman encode my files using the rust program i built a few minutes ago for maximum efficiency?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Its not worth the extra compresssion for that
 Tob#1798: min is so easy to turn into zip its like 5 presses because i use gms2
 ◈・ Altaꐟ#9999: why are they spamming cheese emote in chat
 FryDev#0372: dang, looking back at previous gmtk winners, there are a ton of really good games
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Nothing that requires anything external to use. So use .zip files its safer
 Bart Moon#2749: Zip only
 OrangoMango#0973: tar files are allowed?
 MrBen#0001: ok ok fine
 xqrd#4298: i just convert my game files to a folder then convert the folder into zip and put it in my itch.io page and select some stuff but idk how you do it
 Cunnah#9270: is there anywhere for asking for playtesters?
 StuartXYZ#1675: Hi, how is everyone doing?
 Thorvald#1806: Is webgl or html build required?
 Dabt#7840: is rar ok, ive gotten smaller files with rar than with zip
 Fusoy#6101: It's simple, if you use 7z, people will rate your game with 1/5 because they can't play it. So use zip
 golds#3845: yes HTML and unity in browser player
 Tob#1798: ok thanks
 Giga chad#0085: ohw yeah I didnt read that sorry
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Can we end the 7z conversation now please. It is not allowed. Use .zip files.
 OrangoMango#0973: yeah
 YaBoiHammad#1204: i am a little bit too hyped up right now lol
 Deleted User hjkM2#1048: 0h sleep

 Developer On Trip#8099: loop & DEATH IS ONLY THE BEGINNING!
 Faenrig#6049: Ah what about any tar archives?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: you're not being warned again. Countdowns in  NOT here
 Aitesedbaن#6908: :D
 Scolon#4218: Ok, I have my unity project open, my IDE open, the stream open, my google docs open, and my trello open. I think I'm ready
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Countdowns in  !!
 golds#3845: Once again Good luck to anyone whos first jam it is like mine! remember to have fun!
 Tob#1798: is there a way to make my game playable without download?
 bit#7212: ~~guys the theme will be unoptimised code!!!~~
 Giga chad#0085: 19MINS!
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: and ofc I gtg. rn. eughhh
 MrBen#0001: yeah thats what we r talking about
 OrangoMango#0973: game jam plan: 30h brainstorming 8h pixel art 10h coding
 xqrd#4298: idk i like the theme from black & white game jam 9
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Just use zip then there is no confusion or debate
 JuliusCube#8501: 1 sec lemme graph these numbers on desmos
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: that's totally fine!
 rhythm heaven monkey#9052: is 7z more efficient?
 Developer On Trip#8099: 1- black and white 8

 Sapient#3138: A game where u cheat
 PepperTroopa#4091: its almost gamer time
 Jeker#3389: best action tbh
 Scolon#4218: GMTK game jam themes are always good, don't worry guys
 Giga chad#0085: yeah I know but its like something that is like. idk its a bit hard to have different ideas for it
 Morg#8585: as a twine user i 1000% endorse this message
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: why is that stupid?
 xqrd#4298: when the theme starts its gonna be 7 pm for me so im gonna make game ideas and the game tomorrow
 Developer On Trip#8099: I just joined 2 jams before
 Sapient#3138: Hmm the decrease is also seen right now , 18.8k members have joined till now
This would be the first year where number decreases
 Ibra#8468: that was literally a good theme
 golds#3845: same to you
 rhythm heaven monkey#9052: making a unity project before the jam starts is cheating! you can't have unity installed on your computer before the jam starts, that would give people too much of an advantage!
 Jeker#3389: pretty sure winrar can unzip .7zip
 Giga chad#0085: lol I am just scared that the theme is going to be something so stupid like the one from 2017 "Dual Purpose Design".
 gamedevless#2058: what about alkajam#
 matet2001#7593: thanks
 Aitesedbaن#6908: what's some of the best themes you've seen?
 Astral#7476: Good luck everyone! I am sure you will all do a great job! 🙂
 Tob#1798: stream on gmtk youtube
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: yes there will be, mark might even break out the at everyone again
 GrowDev#7801: Sh**'s about to go down. u guys ready?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: On youtube, itch.io and in  are where we'll post it (and probably more places!)
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: If it requires external software then it's not allowed
 HopeMetal#0586: people saying they are creating a Unity project before the jam starts:
me: *laughs in Godot Engine*
 Tyrix#6647: nope, because you need third party software to unpack that
 OrangoMango#0973: gg
 golds#3845: don't think this is that funny
 Lawn#1538: If you're creating WebGL games, you need to use .zip
 Developer On Trip#8099: Here is a list of the most well-known game jams in the world:
Global Game Jam: the themes are usually very interesting!
Ludum Dare: hardcore but thrilling!
Weekly Game Jam: a great place to start out. ...
Game Maker's Tool Kit: they had over 750 games submitted last time.
Brackeys' game jam: the community is amazing.
 gamedevless#2058: i use the pygame library
 Jeker#3389: ofcs it is, its just a zip file
 Pangords#8020: yes i guess
 matet2001#7593: there will be some announcement event? or it will be just posted on the jam site
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: everyone was indoors looking for something to do
 MrBen#0001: hey is .7z file allowed in the jam?
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: one of the upsides of covid lmao
 xqrd#4298: i use piskel beacuse its built-in the game engine i use
 M_Raven#4076: The jump between 2019 and 2020 💀
 Dabt#7840: the jump from 2019 to 2020 , damn
 Aitesedbaن#6908: interesting observation, I see a surplus of people who are game developers, but very little 2d artists
 Atemit#4061: Than do yell at them
 Tob#1798: what he said
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: just ignore 'em

 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: soon, huh?
 Morg#8585: ignore them! they're not worth it
 HopeMetal#0586: when the game jam starts at a time I don't really want to start making a game lol
 gamedevless#2058: python
 rhythm heaven monkey#9052: spammers are making me want to leave jam (or at the very least yell at spammers)
 LOPSTERu#3902: what were the previous themes?
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: make a team and one person submits!
 theChief#0001: yep!
 GavRaz#6261: so since im doing the jam with my pal, do we just make the game then one of us submits to the jam with the credits of everyone?
 theChief#0001: there's gonna be a youtube enforced 60 second countdown, so we're not getting the theme until a minute past at the earliest 😉
 Sapient#3138: I used it to start pixel animation
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: hmm short amount of time left before jam. More time to pixelart mods. ~~I cannot pixelart decently. But hey who cares it's silly fan art for a reason :D~~
 Pangords#8020: What language will you program your game in?
 gamedevless#2058: the video is 10 seconds late
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Theme guesses iiiiiiiiiiin  pleeeease 👍
 Scolon#4218: Anyways let me get my project open and setup
 theChief#0001: along with the generic asset store assets that I use in every game like Shapes, MP UI Kit, DOTween and LeanPool!
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Due to the large amount of messages as we're reaching the start of the jam, we're raising the chat timer in here to 1 minute! It's just gonna be more and more messages, so thank you for understanding!
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: No thats pretty standard to get stuff set up ready so long as not actual coding or game creation happens
 Finboror#8230: me!!
 OrangoMango#0973: 26min left
 Scolon#4218: I used piskel back in like 2018
 Maikha#4246: oh ok
 theChief#0001: I've done exactly this 🙂
 Barigamb#2319: Imagine still looking for a teammate
 xqrd#4298: who uses piskel?
 Tob#1798: that and built in sprite thing in gms2
 SlamBamActionman#7160: If you're gonna post hype spam, then  is the channel for you! 😉
 Finboror#8230: in reality im gonna get a tummy ache
 Giga chad#0085: Am I the only one who is just already downloading packages he knows he is gonna use like post-procssing and cinemachine and probuilder and progrids 😂
 nizbel#9979: Thanks!
 Pangords#8020: yeah me too
 theChief#0001: this feels like a mistake 😂
 Zixon7#3892: Yes

 Maikha#4246: **BEANS**
 Cunnah#9270: hello

 Pangords#8020: is it just me or i think that u watch dani?
 Giga chad#0085: yeah I guesss
 Team Bean#8566: whould be nice
 rinrainicorn#3614: Yes I think so if I remember correctly! Since I've used their animations before for game jams! But I'm currently scrolling through their copyright page 😅  Just wondering if this specific gamejam had something against using their premade models 🤔
 nizbel#9979: Does anyone have a good tutorial on how to set an itch page? Never done it before
 Fearless Artist#3061: got it thanks
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: What fresh cheese-/bread-related hellscape is that youtube chat
 ToomiTech#6676: thanks
 Nobody6502#8971: You set your teammates when you submit
 Pangords#8020: on gmtk youtube channel
 Dabt#7840: youtube vid
 theChief#0001: yeah I was expecting 20k and it looks like I'm bang on 😉
 Fearless Artist#3061: hey guys is there a way to register as a team for the jam? i joined but its only my account
 ToomiTech#6676: where can see the live chat ??
 Pangords#8020: is there anyone that already participated in the brackeys game jam?
 Dabt#7840: dont jinx urself
 Mrinin#2181: Well, it's still less than last year, but that was amidst a pandemic so 🤷‍♂️
 Nobody6502#8971: I want to know which chat will be more disappointed hehe
 xqrd#4298: someone sayed to spam cheese before the spam happend
 Tob#1798: I think discord if ur participating
 FryDev#0372: it’s gmtk, the theme’s probably gonna be good
 epicman#3996: they are cheesed to meet you
 Giga chad#0085: BRO WHY IS EVERYBODY SPAMMING CHEESE DID I MISS SOMETHING?
 Morg#8585: both
 DrJavaSaurus#5937: Something good would be a horrible theme
 Dabt#7840: discord is less of a clusterfuck
 express_0#3289: depends
 Maikha#4246: I hope the theme is something good
 Nobody6502#8971: Now here’s the question, do I watch the live chat or the discord chat during the premiere
 FryDev#0372: wow the spam is really bad
 Morg#8585: awesome!
 Mrinin#2181: Game jam hit 20k joins right before it begins!
 Nostalgic Futurist#2930: there was a dutch 2d asset package that i purchased a while back. What was its name maybe ?
 Dabt#7840: wouldnt be suprised if its a bot raid in the chat ngl
 The4thAD#7854: Half an hour more lets get that breadd
 Tob#1798: *knee slap*
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Yeah you just add what info you can to the page so you don't have to set it up during the jam time. You don't have to
 Peter#0007: 'aight guys imma hop out for a while but best of luck to everyone and i can't wait to see what y'all come up with!!! 🖖
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: That's why you hid chat to not go totally insane yet
 golds#3845: I thought this would be different for some reason
 Morg#8585: maybe they think they're being cheesy
 Scolon#4218: People always spam in youtube live chats, they're never civil
 Lawn#1538: You can set up a placeholder project exactly as you've stated here. It's not so obvious for beginners and lots of people spend their last precious minutes freaking out about the process, so it's better to check it out now if you've never done it.
 Tob#1798: lol yea
 Dabt#7840: someone had the idea to spam smth and ig people are following it?
 golds#3845: Why are people spamming cheese? thats annoying
 SlamBamActionman#7160: As long as you have permission to use them! I am not familiar with Mixamo but they should have a statement regarding their copyright somewhere on their website 🙂
 Nostalgic Futurist#2930: me too im scared
 Melwing#3159: If you have the right to use it, use it.
 Pangords#8020: hello guys its the first time im participating in the gmtk game jam
 Peter#0007: do you have the right to use the assets?
 rinrainicorn#3614: Yeah I read the rules! It's regarding using Mixamos premade models. Because I've read in other gamejam forums that the mixamo animations were allowed but not the character models themselves. So it was just regarding that. And I guess if you can use their models as a base and change it?
 Dabt#7840: there is no real point to me to make a page in advance,  its 2 clicks to setup a page
 golds#3845: Just made it
 Peter#0007: placeholder page
 Thorvald#1806: How do you create a page without the game though? Its just creating a banner/thumbnail, description, title and the game itself right?
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: It's like i'm excited and won't even have a job the first couple hours of the jam lmao
 Dabt#7840: probably not
 PepperBoi#4544: Anyone else playing past gmtk picks before the jam starts
 Haagenmeister#7220: Can I make a game that is exclusively played via twitch chat ?
 Scolon#4218: The mods have been great though, wdym lol
 Melwing#3159: Peace, good luck all!
 Giga chad#0085: damn I thought that would be a rickroll lol
 Aitesedbaن#6908: hi
 Melwing#3159: That's good, they're also arguing with what they just said 🙂
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: You need to upload your game to itch.io so I'm suggesting you make the page and get it ready in advance before hand so that you're not juggling doing that during the jam time.
48 hours isn't long to make a game, don't give yourself extra tasks
 Cheese#8160: Its Discord mods so yeah... but the good thing is you don't actually have to talk in this Discord at all to be part of the Game Jam
 Peter#0007: yeah the mods have been super understanding and willing to repeat themselves what LOL
 Morg#8585: it's a big jam and there's loads of people here in the server, it's not unreasonable that they're shutting down  stuff quickly. and they're remarkably kind and patient regardless, i don't get this comment
 LurkNautili#3246: I wonder if I can have someone else from the team do the Itch stuff this time... 🤔
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: helloo :D
 golds#3845: itch page is like a website to put your game on
 Dabt#7840: what, the mods have been nothing but kind and chill
 Thorvald#1806: Thought so
 Melwing#3159: Hey look I'm not the arguing type but I had heard the mods were going a bit nuts in here and it's true. Might want to chill *just a bit*, since you're basically arguing with yourselves at this point
 golds#3845: THX!
 Dabt#7840: its the difference between a youtube channel and youtube video
 Ibra#8468: after the jam ends  !!
 Peter#0007: page for the game (ie itch.io/user/gamename) vs ur account page (itch.io/user)
 golds#3845: is there a channel for that?
 Wassomi#2050: if I make an empty itch page and submit that to the game jam, would I need to resubmit it again later or will any progress me already "submitted"
 Mitch#4589:  Thank you!
 LurkNautili#3246: well, there's enough room/ambiguity to interpret that either way
 Thorvald#1806: Wait, whats the difference between an Itch page, and an Itch account?
 Lawn#1538: The next 48 hours is going to go by really quick.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I didn't actually. I suggested it's a good idea to get things ready beforehand so that you don't have to do it in the jam time
 Mother_of_Steel#3868: It will so break 😩
 Lawn#1538: Precautionary measure. Better to test it while you have free time.
 Hamilton#0526: Howdy
 rinrainicorn#3614: I have a question regarding allowed graphical assets, where should I ask that? It's regarding Mixamo
 Fusoy#6101: Be careful, itch.io servers are slow at the end, because there's so much people uploading their games
 Mitch#4589: Do you have to submit the game to discord as well?
 Melwing#3159:  well your fellow mod just told everyone to make it now, hence their confusion. 🙂
 Piotrek4#6196: sup
 Peter#0007: problem with tools is they restrict your thinking to what you can communicate through a keyboard/mouse etc. once you have genre and concept sorted though other tools can be handy, for ex: interactive games -> twine, numbers-heavy -> excel
 Lawn#1538: No, but it's a good precaution to test it out.
 horse#3995: lmao i have work sat and sun im so screwed
 Cheese#8160: Well I assume by page the mods really mean project on your itch dashboard
 SwivelDev (He/Him)#4259: I'll do it around 15 minutes left to make it look good
 PepperBoi#4544: Yes I love the games made in it but I gotta stick with Godot until I'm done with my current projects
 Yoshi#0080: right!
 Lawn#1538: That's obviously what I'm getting at lol.
 golds#3845: I mean at the begining of the jam
 Scolon#4218: We've surpassed 20k joined
 Melwing#3159: Which no, you don't 🙂 right
 LurkNautili#3246: yeah I'm not making a page until I have 5 min left
 Thorvald#1806: you dont need a page, you need an account
 Melwing#3159: They clearly meant "we need to make it NOW?"
 Cheese#8160: Create an itch page in like 40 hours?
 Scolon#4218: Google docs
 Lawn#1538: How did you intend to submit you game for review?
 Jeker#3389: pen and paper
 Redline#7370: at 1fps it won't take up more than 5gb
 Melwing#3159: No you absolutely don't yet lol
 Thorvald#1806: Is there anything I should do to my Itch page besides have it exist + signed up to the jam? Do I need profile-decor?
 nizbel#9979: Do you guys use any tool to brainstorm?
 PepperBoi#4544: What its 40 minutes?
 golds#3845: wait we need to make the Itch Page?
 LurkNautili#3246: I've timelapsed with OBS before but I had strange results at least once
 Scolon#4218: There's 40 minutes left
 anonymousProgramer#2116: thats gonna take up a ton of storgae space.
 Redline#7370: yes
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: just over an half an hour to get your tools open and updated, get your itch page made be sure you have joined the game jam
 Peter#0007: Does OBS allow you to record that slow?
 golds#3845: ? I just use OBS and speed it up in post
 Redline#7370: it's called recording at 1fps and speeding it up by 60x in editing
 Thorvald#1806: record your screen then fast forward?
 Scolon#4218: Submitting something is usually better than submitting nothing, no matter how bad you think your ideas are you should move forward with one of them I think
 Peter#0007: anybody know a good timelapse program for macOS?
 Aless.c06#6763: Mine is time management since I cab't work tomorrow
 Thorvald#1806: I always get too many ideas, hard to pick one
 kate.#8888: damn I forgot this shit is happening
 Chimplement#7074: yeah so many messages you'll miss alot when you look away
 Giga chad#0085: yeah same man I always make a stupid game about a stupid idea and just scrap it over after half of the jam
 Melwing#3159: I like to put the restriction on myself that I am terrible garbage, it makes it interesting
 Shimp#0064: i wonder if there is anyone who joined the jam just to join the discord
 Redline#7370: no I've been starring at this discord window for the past 3 hours
 PGtheVRguy#7064: Anyone putting up any restrictions on themself? Mines is to try and incorporate car driving
 Chimplement#7074: did you stare at them the full 3 hours
 AzE#0001: I honestly think coming up with a good idea is going to be the hardest for me
 Thorvald#1806: You guys are using Trello? damn I got a pen and paper
 Redline#7370: I had them open for like 3 hours now
 AzE#0001: Trello and Unity open now.
 Giga chad#0085: k I am very sorry
 golds#3845: :0
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: No. Move on. Last warning
 Giga chad#0085: ok jeez chill man
 Ibra#8468: up to you but personally i spend like a couple of hours, i know people that spend a bit more though, and its fine if you do i think
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Good choice to immediately come back an complain. This is your chance to move on and join the conversation. End of discussion
 not without text#5469: if you want you can look at my youtube channel/discord server of the same name
 adrenalyzed#5024: fair but its just cool to see your progression and think of ways to improve
 PGtheVRguy#7064: How to make a AAA video game in Unity in 10 minutes
 Max - Winteractive#9512: Not sure what Golds joke was. But I fail to see the harm. BUT sure I can accept that this event has some rules - even if I don't understand them
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: You can do that in other places, I enjoy dark humour myself but we don't allow it here because there's lots of new people and its not always clear its a joke.
 Bolitop#7838: My 100th jam
 AzE#0001: I have "Not Finished" "Working On" and "Done".
 Jonathor#1971: How long should we spend on brainstorm
 Thorvald#1806: No one ever climbed a mountain with a single step
 Hederlunden#3231: good luck, you will succeed
 Giga chad#0085: Bruh I made a joke And I got muted for 10 min
 Bolitop#7838: Trello
 adrenalyzed#5024: if you continue with game development in about a year after this you are gonna look at the game you make and think "why"
 golds#3845: I like your baba is you pfp
 AzE#0001: I dont have to do that, but a guy said he "opened unity for the first time".
 GodOfPro#7302: do you guys think a todo list with
Nice To Have - Should Have - Done
is enough ?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Some people will not get that it's a joke, and take it at face value. Let's try to keep things classy yeah? 🙂
 BBB#7952: you underestimate my brain power
 Giga chad#0085: BRO ME
 PGtheVRguy#7064: Who hyped?
 Wolf'1988 🐺⚔#1859: oh nice thank yo 🙂
 not without text#5469: you can't really do that you might as well do scratch
 Thorvald#1806: 45 minutes till game jam start, time to open up the "How to make your first game TODAY" 30 minute youtube video, wish me luck guys
 Tob#1798: np
 adrenalyzed#5024: theres a video premiering on the gmtk channel
 Giga chad#0085: lol
 golds#3845: 46 min
 Max - Winteractive#9512: Why can't some joke about an obvious part of the industry, and find humor in it (even if that humor is dark?) I mean, a Game Jam really resembles a crunchy-sprint in a lot of ways.
 Wolf'1988 🐺⚔#1859: When will the theme get announced
 Azurezero#4851: im not very good at doing stuff consecutively anymore, i burntout on a project 6 years ago and ive never been the same
so whatever i make has to be small or i dont stand a chance
 vlady.ts#4296: thanks tob
 FryDev#0372: I’m not coming up with any ideas before the theme
 Giga chad#0085: bro this stresses me out like I am already thinking of a hole game and I am just scared that the theme will TOTTALLY not fit it
 Bolitop#7838: gl bro
 AzE#0001: learn unity in 48 hours and make a good game 💀
 golds#3845: yes sir 😎
 Dabt#7840: too lazy, and pizza grease
 vlady.ts#4296: where will be the announcement of the jam's theme?
 BBB#7952: im gonna make a bestselling game ez
 Morg#8585: me too! im excited
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: its ok, it's just not really a joke when its real if that makes sense. Eat, drink, rest, have a good game jam
 Thorvald#1806: my friend, simply set a timer
 AzE#0001: for the first time?? rip
 Jeker#3389: you know, i am stressed out but like, the good kind of stressed out
 BBB#7952: time to open up unity for the first time 😎
 Dabt#7840: someone @ me or smth when the theme is announced, gonna shove a whole pizza down my throat for the next hour
 Giga chad#0085: lol who also has trello and Unity / any other engine  open 😂
 golds#3845: I am gunna give myself an hour to 2 hours at max for that
 adrenalyzed#5024: also true
 AzE#0001: I hope I come up with an idea for my game fast
 Morg#8585: making sure you also have a rough draft submission, even if it's not your final, most polished version is super helpful too! cause itch gets laggy at the end
 golds#3845: Apologizes I did not mean harm and will refrain from such comments again
 Azurezero#4851: normally the theme is something all encapsulating, could be narrative, could be gameplay
 adrenalyzed#5024: tip: submit an hour - 30 minutes before the deadline bc it makes it less stressful
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824:  we're not having jokes about crunch thank you. Its a real problem in the industry and therefore it isn't funny
 RedcoatsRevolt (Adam)#1185: First game squaaaaad
 Morg#8585: im in an online class right now so i feel you, i'm not actually free to start until two hours after the jam begins (not quite as bad, but i empathize!)
 Thorvald#1806: Same :)
 ConfusedSquirrel#7137: Same
 MrBen#0001: cool
 golds#3845: This is my first game jam and my goal is to finish it :)
 RedcoatsRevolt (Adam)#1185: Same. I'm using the time at work to passively think about the theme and such
 Morg#8585: you're totally right, i'll do that
 GoldRino456#8174: Prepare yourself for the most epic game of tic tac toe ever created. 😂
 Azurezero#4851: so its mapped to a sphere?
 rhythm heaven monkey#9052: well if your text adventure has a system for rooms, just link up the exits all weird, done
 Casper#6361: Yeah absolutely! I am sure you'll manage something cool
 adrenalyzed#5024: if thats the case im just gonna buy hyperbolica and submit that
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Theme guesses in  please!
 Thorvald#1806: Game theme: No straight lines allowed
 rhythm heaven monkey#9052: same
 Morg#8585: then my text adventure is screwed from the start
 Uthel#6594: the oceans of melted brains
 GoldRino456#8174: This gives me hope. I'm stuck working for the first 6hrs of the jam (unfortunate scheduling lol). Still would've been better if I had the full time, but gotta work with the hand you're dealt, right? lol
 Galactum#6235: oh nooo
 Thorvald#1806: Guys what if the game theme is Non-Euclidean geometry
 ConfusedSquirrel#7137: looks up how to make shapes 🙂 me too.
 JJfriends#3686: ready to make a game lookin like super mario
 Casper#6361: +1
 Galactum#6235: my game will literally just be shapes
 golds#3845: SAME
 JJfriends#3686: Guys mark my words my game will be in pixel art and will have like 4 colors to it
 Thorvald#1806: I draw low-rez textures in photoshop, then put them in blender, its pretty easy and doesn't take much artistic talent
 RedcoatsRevolt (Adam)#1185: Also make sure to playtest
 golds#3845: don't be I am sure that you would have a good spin on the idea
 rhythm heaven monkey#9052: if it's a 3d game, draw things in ms paint / your editor of choice and slap them on 3d models
 JJfriends#3686: bru
 Morg#8585: wonder if we're going to beat last year's amount before it even begins
 YaBoiHammad#1204: good advice, ty
 rhythm heaven monkey#9052: draw things in ms paint / your editor of choice
 golds#3845: ^
 Azurezero#4851: i normally get immediately turned off when i hear the theme because i know my ideas are plebian and probably something tens of other devs would make
 Thorvald#1806: No matter what happens during the Jam, the important thing is that you use what you've learned in the future
 Casper#6361: Last year I scrapped everything after 10 hours, you can always recover and submit at least something
 Words#3160: "Default Noveau"
 rhythm heaven monkey#9052: after 0.1% of your time budget: you picked the very first idea that came to mind because you can't think of anything else now
after 10% of your time budget: you get bored and leave the jam
 Dabt#7840: i play test too much,i make a single change and i play test for 15 mins
 golds#3845: **You must CONSUME**
 Roiboi#2055: any idea what style would be good if you theoretically had no modelers or artists
 Azurezero#4851: im glad we can use pre-owned audio and sounds
cause i cant make music to save my life and i dont like bfxr sounds
 RedcoatsRevolt (Adam)#1185: Very True. Playtest a lot!
 YaBoiHammad#1204: thanks, for the advice everyone, ill definitely use it!
 hungryroy#0352: 1st day thinking of how to meet the theme, 2nd day anxiety
 Galactum#6235: this whole time management stuff scares me because i know i wont be able to do it so ill just do whatever i can i guess
 SquidGeneral10#4090: mmkay 👀👍
 LurkNautili#3246: The restaurant next door to me has an ad/slogan on one of its windows that says "We will grill. You will eat." Is it just me or does that sound like a threat? 😄
 RetroPigeon#9187: Hello folks. I can't wait for the Jam to start
 Casper#6361: Just lacks the playtesting
 Dabt#7840: my rule with time is "if you cant finish it without sacrificing smth else that is important, cut it off or move on"
 yassine569#9906: 55 min left
 RedcoatsRevolt (Adam)#1185: This is something I saw on a Wowie Jam
After 5% of your time budget: You came up with multiple game ideas on paper and picked the most interesting one.
After 25% of your time budget: You experimented with your idea a bit and the basic game loop is done.
After 50% of your time budget: The most important visuals and sounds are implemented. Your game is fully playable.
After 75% of your time budget: The game looks, sounds and plays even better. It might also have a short tutorial now.
After 100% of your time budget: Final bugs are fixed,  game is uploaded to a decent looking itchio page.
 Azurezero#4851: 1st day for gameplay to completion, 2nd day polish
 Dabt#7840: dont do that, the theme can throw that plan out if its different from ur idea
 golds#3845: no
 Casper#6361: This is my first year with a faster computer as well
 Words#3160: hah! hi there 🙂
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Should not be necessary I think, but hey, doesn't hurt 😉
 Thorvald#1806: get 8 hours of sleep
 Jeker#3389: dont waste too much time when stuck on something
 DevByMarc#7784: Good 4 u, It's 12am in the morning here, so the only thing that is ready is my bed 🥳
 Galactum#6235: yes
 ᎮᎥᏋᏒᏒᏋ#1199: sleep
 theChief#0001: make a game you think you can do in 20-30% of the available time!
 Azurezero#4851: anyone already decided what kind of game they want to make?
 null_ham#2050: hi edward
 YaBoiHammad#1204: any tips on time management for the jam?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: That's alright 👍
 Words#3160: DAMMIT *closes unity*
I guess it'll be a 32.5-hour jam for me
 Dabt#7840: creating the project is fine if its empty
 Thorvald#1806: sorry bud, thats grounds for disqualification
 SquidGeneral10#4090: Do I have to "join" the jam via the itch page, even if I've already been added as an admin on another person's project page?
 unityAccount#7810: Aren't you going solo?
 swiney#1826: got a t-shirt blessed by Mark for getting into his video
 Words#3160: Does it count as "building code specifically for the jam" if I've already clicked "start new project" in Unity and it's slooooowwwwwlllllyyyy creatttingnnggggg the projeeeccttt?
 Dabt#7840: one person did send it in chat but it got nuked
 golds#3845: Good idea to make the project before you start!
 Thorvald#1806: Who knew that insulting the server own and telling people to spam his chat would get you timed out, this generation
 Jeker#3389: oh my god fuck you reminded me i need to setup webgl
 Morg#8585: i've got twine open so as long as i remember how to write words i should be all set
 rhythm heaven monkey#9052: this doesn't seem to be happening yet, thank god
 Teslobo#8274: There was similar spam before and every participant got banned. There's your warning
 theChief#0001: right ok I've got my packages imported, I've got my project open and the build settings sorted, we've got a git repo that everyone can access
I think I'm good to go!
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: If you don't like the discord you can have 10 mins away from it to enjoy yourself
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: it's only going to get worse
 golds#3845: My WiFi was out when I woke up today so I had to drive to a new location for the jam
 Giga chad#0085: jeez this discord.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yeah we got it don't worry
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: we've got a handle on it thanks
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Some games get featured in a video but there's no official prize
 Words#3160:  this might be one to watch. :/
 Tob#1798: I feel like   just here to not be a giga chad
 PepperBoi#4544: No like not using a tileset its just using polygons in godot
 Scolon#4218: Yeah please don't do this
 Thorvald#1806: Guys, let us all spam polite, contextual conversations in the game jam stream chat
 Dabt#7840: the spam of a random word is very much a "its funny to be annoying" which its not
 golds#3845: I agree
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Knock it off or you can go have some private chill time
 Tob#1798: ok thanks
 Mark Brown#6982: Counterpoint: let's not
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: no
 MrBen#0001: nope
 Casper#6361: The jam is probably relevant enough to get a Wikipedia page
 Azurezero#4851: my way of doing destructable terrain was just making blocks that delete the tiles on a certain depth when destroyed
 Dabt#7840: 250k views in the game dev space is huge
 Giga chad#0085: guys lets all spam BLUEBERRY in the live stream till mark notices it lol
 Tob#1798: is there a prize for this game jam (sorry if this is a stoopid question)
 Thorvald#1806: Mark, the obscure lesser-known youtuber with 250,000 views on his latest video, never heard of him
 Dabt#7840: they have a wikipedia?
 PepperBoi#4544: I learned a new system for making destructible ground knowing that I would probably use it for gmtk but I'm going to remake it for the jam
 Azurezero#4851: an hour til the theme is announced and i find out if my brain shuts down again
 ESC#8775: Technically if you win Ludum Dare a prize you get is getting featured on Wikipedia
 MrBen#0001: nah I wont stream
 GavRaz#6261: dissing GMTK in the GMTK server
 Giga chad#0085: okk chill
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I would say thats untrue as this is the GMTK channel
 Words#3160: *drops Captain America Chair*
So you said a silly thing.
 Dabt#7840: i couldnt give a damn about a prize or a 1st place but *being on a video and getting praised, boi, now that is some shit i can get motivated for *
 GavRaz#6261: you get either bragging right and friends, or bragging rights, friends, and being featured in mark's vid and also always feeling good :)
 Casper#6361: Indeed everyone cares the most they possibly can
 Aless.c06#6763: 
 DevByMarc#7784: Make friends and gain new experience
 Redline#7370: I care
 SwivelDev (He/Him)#4259: I care
 infernoNoodles#8206: You missed yuor calling of being a lawyer or a jewish cleric.
 Dabt#7840: i care
 Thorvald#1806: The real prize is the friends we made along the way
 GavRaz#6261: oh no
 FECU!#5310: Ugh, I thought it started in 3 mins. An hour and 3 mins. Hey ho.
 Intedai#9642: If I clicked on join does my friend need to also click it
 Casper#6361: Everyone is a winner
 FryDev#0372: it would be very nice to win
 DevByMarc#7784: 🥳
 Giga chad#0085: dsf
 SwivelDev (He/Him)#4259: I agree
 Dabt#7840: bragging rights
 ESC#8775: Getting featured in Mark's video? Ig
 Thorvald#1806: Can't wait to see lots of "I lost the gamejam because I re-wrote my game 15 times" youtube videos
 MrBen#0001: yeah one of the best shows ever
 Casper#6361: Eternal fame
 wren#0640: mark brown gets one of your kidneys
 FryDev#0372: no prize, just a warm fuzzy feeling
 SuperPenguinDev#0275: knowledge
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: this game jam has no prize
 Giga chad#0085: what is the price of winning tho?
 SwivelDev (He/Him)#4259: Also glep pfp
 MrBen#0001: clickbait title: "WINNING 10K$ PRIZE GMTK GAMEJAM"
 Tob#1798: I doing the same thing
 Dabt#7840: i always have to modify them anyway, so im still gonna have to edit them alot
 SwivelDev (He/Him)#4259: Same here lol
 MrBen#0001: Im mkaing vid out of it ngl
 Redline#7370: I still have time till I start my stream but it's ready
 wren#0640: i have a few useful scripts in a blank project but nothing i wrote specifically *for* the jam
 hungryroy#0352: i wish i had generic scripts. feels like i just reinvent everything every time lol
 Tob#1798: me too
 Dabt#7840: im using old generic scripts for my game, but im not gonna slap them in a project and get them going til the jam begins , feels like cheating
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: please read the  and the itch page from rulle rules and info
 SwivelDev (He/Him)#4259: Same here
 iceberglettuce#4394: ooooooh you’re in trouble
 DevByMarc#7784: 😢 all good! Haha
 JuliusCube#8501: its just against the spirit of the jam to write code before the jam starts
 MrBen#0001: My obs is already prepared to start recording
 Thorvald#1806: Whos to say I wasn't just tuning up my wasd movement skills
 Mark Brown#6982: "we ask that you don’t write code specifically for this jam, ahead of time."
 wren#0640: hey is that the guy who made untitled magnet game???
 JuliusCube#8501: i dont think i remember you, but hello anyway!
 rhythm heaven monkey#9052: correct
 Thorvald#1806: I mean the website says you can use preexisting code
 MrBen#0001: true... Hey mark btw!
 ESC#8775: Is it ok if I join a team during the jam itself?
 FryDev#0372: it’s the magnets guy
 Redline#7370: hi mark
 DevByMarc#7784: Hey! I remember you from Brackeys Game Jam 🤘
 Casper#6361: I actually never made a platformer for a jam
 Mark Brown#6982: "This is a race to make a game, and everyone starts running when the jam begins!"
 MrBen#0001: yeah you need to change A LOT od settings ot make the default ue4 template look good lol
 dardasaba#9759: No that's starting to make the actual game ahead of time
 JuliusCube#8501: that and also basic controls
 Redline#7370: we need a bunch of people with a role of "countdown mods" clearly
 Casper#6361: Blank 2d unity template for me
 Stopa#6148: also changing the build platform takes forever, so if you know you're doing webGL, set it up now to save some precious minutes
 Morg#8585: i love it
 JuliusCube#8501: guys ive preemptively created a unity project with the very creative name "ksdjfsdjklh" for the game jam
 BadPiggy#5202: They were here in the first place ?
 IamHaPPy#2536: guys someone get theme, we lost him again
 Casper#6361: That's not entirely in the spirit
 JuliusCube#8501: countdowns should be in  apparently
 SwivelDev (He/Him)#4259: I'm so excited
 Stopa#6148: And add all packages you know you will use, like inputsystem, cinemachine and DOTween in my case.
 IamHaPPy#2536: slowmode just got longer
 Murten#0001: 3... 2... 1... GO!
 Casper#6361: I literally just started tla blank project
 Thorvald#1806: Probably set up a moveable character too, or a menu, or both
okay fair enough
 nizbel#9979: how go you guys prepare unity? Just create a new project and create a few folders?
 dardasaba#9759: But I'll still have all of Saturday and all of Sunday until 20:00 so I mean I'll still have two days
 IamHaPPy#2536: ban him
 Scolon#4218: We're at 19.8k people joined now
 Dabt#7840: i probably should start downloading the assets and my test projects with the scripts i want to use so i dont have to do it mid jam
 Strangespañol#1093: where is theme?
 JuliusCube#8501: mods, get him /j
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: cmon man we're literally having a conversation about keeping countdowns to hype!
 dardasaba#9759: Welp, gotta leave home now, will only be back late and then will go straight to bed... :/
 Scolon#4218: Guys the lurkers are starting to show up
 MrBen#0001: wow 1 h 9 mins till gamejam
 snuffysam#2767: I’ve made a game before where the whole game is trying to skip through an overly long tutorial
 Stopa#6148: metacountdown: the number of mod messages reminding us to keep countdown to hype signifies the start of the jam
 Murten#0001: It just does. Try it. Open your console in your favorite browser.
 JuliusCube#8501: mine will just be a start button, webgl games dont need quitting
 Redline#7370: thanks for the idea joink
 GavRaz#6261: im just playing roblox rn lmao
 rhythm heaven monkey#9052: i mean there's a nonzero chance i make my game in raw html5
 hungryroy#0352: my game wont have a quit button, you have to alt f4
 Scolon#4218: Time is ticking down so fast ah man
 IamHaPPy#2536: my coder is at the cinema i hope he makes it in time
 Dabt#7840: i hate menu design and code, so i just do a start and quit button, and make the pause menu a copy of that
 Casper#6361: Maybe a settings button which literally only has master volume
 Redline#7370: I love how this is basically the most common mod message now
 Thorvald#1806: what if your game IS the menu
 Casper#6361: Best honestly
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Remember to keep countdowns to  btw!
 Dabt#7840: my menu will be a start and quit button
 JuliusCube#8501: how does that work
 hungryroy#0352: planning to stay up to watch the theme reveal then let my subconscious mull things over as i sleep
 Thorvald#1806: I will add a puzzle for volume controls too then
 IamHaPPy#2536: put the premiere on while you sleep, you can think of game ideas while you sleep
 Casper#6361: I'd watch the reveal
 SeanSS#0892: Midnight for me too should I sleep or should I stay up and watch the theme reveal?
 NitramiuZ#4145: If the time is there, you should have a menu so that you can have a good place for things like volume controls, it is something any game benefits from (unless there is no audio)
 SwivelDev (He/Him)#4259: dodododoooo
 IamHaPPy#2536: it's the final countdown
 Murten#0001: ```
2 + 2 = 4
"2" + "2" = 22
"2" + "2" - "2" = 20
```
 hungryroy#0352: is almost midnight here
 Among us#2308: I need sleep... gn everyone!
 SeanSS#0892: Jam in an hour lesgo
 JuliusCube#8501: agree which is why Im on the fence about it
 RedcoatsRevolt (Adam)#1185: My partner is Ace. I'm no mod but i'll keep an eye out for the hate. ❤️
 Morg#8585: my condolences on that, hopefully the sleep is restful
 Lennyi#3831: ye
 Among us#2308: It would be cool, but the more that get added, the more certain groups would feel excluded
 GavRaz#6261: yeah
 FryDev#0372: seems like it
 hungryroy#0352: jam starts in what, an hour and 15 mins?
 Stopa#6148: A level selection screen is always nice, so you can skip a level that might be too difficult (don't bother with unlocks, make everything playable from the start)
 Thorvald#1806: I woudn't insult the player by having a simple  "start game" button, they launched the game, it has already started, they should be prepared
 GavRaz#6261: itll be around lunchtime for me when jam starts
 JuliusCube#8501: I feel like we need a link pride flag for other stuff like aro-ace or bisexuality and that sorta stuff but I dont want half the link emotes be flags
 DevByMarc#7784: That's 1 am here, so I'm at dreamland for sure when the jam starts 😴
 Redline#7370: hmm that was fast
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: team finder and 
 Defilerzero#8086: That's disgusting thing for them to do.
 Stopa#6148: it's important to have *a* menu. It's not great to be shoved straight into play after clicking "run". But it can be as simple as a screen with a single "start game" button
 Thorvald#1806: Maybe even a puzzle you have to do if you want to change graphics settings, or mouse sens
 Dragonoyx#7910: Hi, um I need a team Im a 2d artist DM me if you would like me
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: you are valid here and we will bring the ban-hammer down on people who break our rules
 Dabt#7840: ive seen some of those people say agender are not valid either  "you cant define yourself by smth u dont want or like" *yes i can*
 Thorvald#1806: I think the struggle to figure out how to close my game will add to its character
 GavRaz#6261: isnt it called lgbtq+ for a reason?
 Among us#2308: wow really? thats awful!
 wren#0640: you dont *need* a menu but theyre always good to have
 ibhandari072021#7469: for me I will do that during the last 3 hours while polishing
 JuliusCube#8501: tf
its valid what the fuck were they thinking
do they also believe agender and bisexual people arent valid or something?
 SwivelDev (He/Him)#4259: godot gang
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Acephobia and biphobia are surprisingly common in queer circles - but we don't tolerate that crap here
 Among us#2308: me!
 SlamBamActionman#7160: We try our best to catch everything but with all the messages we may sometime miss something, so tag us if you feel something is amiss! We want to keep this server as comfortable of a space as possible 🙂
 ibhandari072021#7469: well good luck to everyone and have fun
 Thorvald#1806: Is a menu important? I feel like menus are important but are they really? Should i spend time on a menu? I dont like menus
 FryDev#0372: yup!
 Arfilish#8729: It's lesser than 2 hours before jam start?
 Dabt#7840: yeah, its kinda why im suprised when i see alot, i dont really mind it, but there might be people who get scared to come out because of that
 Cheese#8160: JavaScript gang JavaScript gang JavaScript gang
 GavRaz#6261: i did i just forgot lol
 nekiwo#7574: our 24 people team just split into unity and godot xd
 Thorvald#1806: just make an account
 Arfilish#8729: Oh yeah, my main menu system works
 JuliusCube#8501: lots of people because godot is great
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Wow, such assholes >:/
 Schmuff#7990: godot gang
 GavRaz#6261: wait i do
 ibhandari072021#7469: who here is using godot for their game?
 Dabt#7840: will do, but ive seen circles that say they dont allow such things and they still happen unpunished, i got harassed in a lgbtq+ server because i said i was ace and they told me  "its not valid"
 JJfriends#3686: im scared for the jam i did this last year but i kinda feel scared
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Or wait fearal got to you first
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Nah I believe in your sense of self-control
 SlamBamActionman#7160: If you see any such behavior here, let us know! We don' allow any such garbage here
 Zoro5168#0115: Sure but man it feels bad not being able to talk. Put me up for another hour ill be back when the jam starts
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: just a headsup, don't try and be funny by asking for a tempmute, we'll either give you a big one or just ban you if you're being extra annoying about it
 Thorvald#1806: Whats wrong with Aces? Shooting down 5 enemy fighters is quite the feat
 JuliusCube#8501: well you gotta give them the tempmute, they asked for it
which is what you did, so good job i guess
 Dabt#7840: yeah but im in more non game dev circles, and *ive seen garbage toward ace people alot*
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Asked for a tempmute
 JuliusCube#8501: what did zoro do?
actually nevermind
 SlamBamActionman#7160: That was one hour, want another one? 😉
 Defilerzero#8086: You'll need an itch.io account to upload your game.
 Zoro5168#0115: IM BACK
 JuliusCube#8501: game devs are often introverted and they like thinking (+ other stuff)
aro-ace people are often introverted and like thinking 
so its no wonder that there are many aro-ace gamedevs
 SwivelDev (He/Him)#4259: Imagine
 Bart Moon#2749: You won't be able to enter the jam
 HG-007#3871: Atleast I'll try doing everything

 GavRaz#6261: i dont even have an itch account lol
 Zigordion#3748: i believe only people participating in the game jams votes count
 Tob#1798: thanks good to know
 PokeNinjaGuy#9592: gigaChad
 Thorvald#1806: I wish you the best of luck
 JuliusCube#8501: no, number of ratings doesnt really matter
 Selviam#7268: I’m for sure not gonna oversleep for the theme bc a fire alarm woke me up
 HG-007#3871: I am

 Morg#8585: not really? most people don’t
 Tob#1798: hey is it going to be a disadvantage to have no followers on itch?
 GavRaz#6261: waza?
 JuliusCube#8501: aromantic asexual
 Dabt#7840: asexual aromantic
 YaBoiHammad#1204: what's aro-ace? (im lost)
 Space#0859: Hey
 HG-007#3871: I found no one
 Dabt#7840: *ive only meet a few ever*
so its nice to see more
 JuliusCube#8501: i feel like there are so many aro-ace people here so you wont have a problem with that
 smearyto#3143: Me!
 Dabt#7840: ace aro flag, ace-aro gang rise up
 smearyto#3143: I like bloons TD
 rhythm heaven monkey#9052: thanks!
 KokoBird#9800:  love the pfp
 Dabt#7840: ive finished a lot of jams, but i never made many of them that are good because i ran out of steam quick
 smearyto#3143: 😂
 rhythm heaven monkey#9052: i've finished a game for a game jam twice (out of 3 attempts), and the first time i didn't use a dropdown properly and submitted an actually good game instead of the one that fits the theme ._.
 Lawn#1538: ~~This is your body's way of telling you that you need to sleep.~~ I read that out of context. Point stands, please sleep.
 smearyto#3143: Yes
 caibi#5324: take care of your body bro.
 MrBen#0001: is it just me or itch is running slower?
 LightHouse#2571: apologies
 SwivelDev (He/Him)#4259: I haven't slept in 3 days so
 Thorvald#1806: Read the theme, then go take a shower or a walk, you'll come up with something
 smearyto#3143: was about to say it
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: let's keep countdowns to hype plz
 Dabt#7840: there is a 100% chance ill say that , and 5 secs later i will be like "nvm"
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: There'll be a bunch of people throwing out ideas so no worries if you can't think of anything
 LightHouse#2571: 1:29hrs left!!!!!!
 davidnjihiahere#6326: I mean, I'm sure I'll be blank on the theme
 SwivelDev (He/Him)#4259: Ibuprofen and Caffeine
 BadPiggy#5202: House pigs are an actual thing though lol
 JJfriends#3686: Same LMAO
 birdstone#3073: oink bröther
 JuliusCube#8501: when somebody decides its a good idea to buy a pig
but also,
öink my fellow pig brethren
 rhythm heaven monkey#9052: 90% chance i'll just say "welp the theme isn't great" and give up after a few seconds of thinking
 BadPiggy#5202: When pigcam
 SwivelDev (He/Him)#4259: He He! Ooohh!
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: catcam is live and is intended to stay so until the jam starts. as long as the cats and the weather cooperate
 WorkingJoe#4433: How
 rhythm heaven monkey#9052: i have no ideas prepared
 NULL3D "Family Friendly" Games#1203: i changed my name bc i realized what it was
 birdstone#3073: oh my god michael jackson is alive and makes games??
 WorkingJoe#4433: Om I'm on my way home but the train I'm in just broke down
 SwivelDev (He/Him)#4259: Oh nice! I have hulu already
 NULL3D "Family Friendly" Games#1203: its on hulu and hbo max
 smearyto#3143: I cant believe i started this
 SwivelDev (He/Him)#4259: Haven't gotten to see it yet 😔
 birdstone#3073: are you now yearning for the days of shadow cloak
 LOPSTERu#3902: dang listening to the chicory ost
 M_Raven#4076: Last-minute team switching 😭, this is already going very poorly
 NULL3D "Family Friendly" Games#1203: specifically the movie
 SaadTheGlad#9716: I'll listen to Bo burnham
 davidnjihiahere#6326: cadence of hyrule/crypt of necrodancer is my jam
 birdstone#3073: kar en tuk brother
 golds#3845: Day of the jam and my WiFi goes out
 SwivelDev (He/Him)#4259: bobs burgers has good music sometimes
 Berkay#5458: thnx mate :3
 NULL3D "Family Friendly" Games#1203: Ahem, I will be listening to Weird Al, Jack Stauber, Splatoon, doom eternal, portal, portal 2, lego dimensions portal 2 expansion pack, beat saber, sodikken, and bobs burgers
 WorkingJoe#4433: HLD OST
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: virtually any game soundtrack for me
 SwivelDev (He/Him)#4259: Queen will keep me sane
 BadPiggy#5202: DOOM music for me
And maybe a few Metal gear rising songs
 smearyto#3143: Splatoon music will keep me sane
 rhythm heaven monkey#9052: hi
 theChief#0001: keep countdowns to  please!
 SlamBamActionman#7160: You will be able to enter any team members you have when you submit the game, but there's nothing special you need to do compared to going solo 🙂
 SwivelDev (He/Him)#4259: I really hate only having 128 gigs. It leaves no space for anything
 BadPiggy#5202: Oof
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: and almost 20K people joined 😮
 WorkingJoe#4433: Guess I didn't read the fine print
 Hmmmm#5767: i thought joining the jam meant signing away our soul already? Hell naw Im not giving away my webcam too 😤
 smearyto#3143: I suck at coding😭
 TheGameShePlays#7762: aha! in that case, whichever suits best for your idea (when you have it)
 Berkay#5458: Hi, do I need to indicate during the application that we will participate as a team or is there anything that I need to do for participate as a team ?
 Anxeal#4160: I'll probably just use some free assets :P I can't do teams
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: lol
 SwivelDev (He/Him)#4259: I can do both
 WorkingJoe#4433: Heeeey nice
 TheGameShePlays#7762: depends what you're best at! I'm terrible at 2D, would take me the whole weekend to put the tiles together neatly, so for me 3D is quicker
 JuliusCube#8501: i meant hide chat not close chat but closing would work as well i guess.
 Redline#7370: checkmate. I don't have a webcam
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: "is mayonaise an instrument?"
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Hi Mark
 Lawn#1538: I'd wait for the theme, however, it really depends on your preference and team/personal abilities.
 BadPiggy#5202: Are you ready for some action actionman ?
 wren#0640: joining the jam actually legally gives mark permission to look through your webcam
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: he's ALWAYS watching
 Hmmmm#5767: Instrument
 Wormdas#5400: 5 gallons of Cold Brew at the ready
 SlamBamActionman#7160: It'll be more trouble to shut the chat down, but yes, people will ask a lot
 SwivelDev (He/Him)#4259: Would it be best to do a 2d game for the jam? Or is it depending on the theme?
 Cheese#8160: Mayonnaise
 Anxeal#4160: the chat lags the whole site for me, probably because of some userscripts
 nekiwo#7574: holy shit hello 👀
great coicidence
 JuliusCube#8501: it may be a good idea to close the chat when this is premiering because people in the chat will spam what the theme is before you even see it show up on the premiere (because of lag or something idk)
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: what do you guys think the theme is going to be?
 Hmmmm#5767: I thought the jam was in 6 hours and was about to go to sleep 😭
 SwivelDev (He/Him)#4259: I just got my PC set back up and I need to install a few things
 TheLuchenator - The 2nd Edition#2025: less than that
 SwivelDev (He/Him)#4259: I'm glad that the jam starts in two hours
 TheGameShePlays#7762: I'm just going out for a lovely walk in the sun to relax my brain ready to think hard thoughts 😅
 Galactum#6235: and unity too now
 Galactum#6235: ok downloading visual studio
 PepperBoi#4544: 🧠
 Redline#7370: it sounds like the thing I'd make but I'm just not gonna ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 JuliusCube#8501: no thank you
 WorkingJoe#4433: Do it
 NULL3D "Family Friendly" Games#1203: devious
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: No need to imagine
 Redline#7370: imagine if someone would make the same video thumbnail with the same title, but it would be a rick roll
 YaBoiHammad#1204: oh, thanks
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Both, on youtube as well
 Changeisontwitch#9198: Both im sure
 NULL3D "Family Friendly" Games#1203: im gonna chug coffee for 2 hours straight and drink a 5 hour energy every 2 hours
 theChief#0001: if you're using git - now would be a good time to set up your repository and make sure everyone has access!
 Lascif#0184: sleep before a big thing is always good. when i slept a bunch before my worst subject at uni I ended up getting really good grades compared to my other subjects
 Uthel#6594: just woke up, no sleep til brooklyn
 YaBoiHammad#1204: will the theme be announced on the discord server or on the itch page?
 OrangoMango#0973: we have 50h not 48h
 Changeisontwitch#9198: More than 6 hours of sleep its like being high for me. SOOOOO UNPRODUCTIVE
 Vabenil#5485: If things worked that way I would be a millionaire and a chess grandmaster
 Scolon#4218: My recommendation is getting 47 hours of sleep and developing your game for 1 hour
Imagine how great your game will be with that much sleep! You'll be mega boosted!
 Maksu#4798: godot gang rise up
 Zorro#9743: sadness
 Redline#7370: sounds about right
 Vabenil#5485: I decided to make my game in Godot, I have never used Godot 😂 , hopefully I don't make a mess
 Changeisontwitch#9198: me 2. I use Unity 5  😭
 NULL3D "Family Friendly" Games#1203: I wonder what my cat will shoot in the game
 Scolon#4218: Guys
 KadDev#8100: **my time plan :**
first 47 hours - relax / think of an idea
47 hours and 2 minutes - make the game
rest of the time - sleep
 YaBoiHammad#1204: do we get to talk to mark during the jam?
 FryDev#0372: this is some good jam
 s4br3#3746: *guys make sure to eat the jam
 Anxeal#4160: wish I had a better pc
 Guibel#7644: hyp hyp hyp
 Scolon#4218: Guys make sure to eat before the jam starts!
 WorkingJoe#4433: I slept 11 hours last night so can you set my timers for 6:30 hours?
 DoctorCampbell#0545: Last year my team of 3 collectively had 9 hours of sleep. We placed 199 overall so I say it was worth it xD
 Phallo#3476: drastically depends on the scale and planning of the game... something simple like tic tac toe or checkers in 48 hours is quite easy... but dont be going expecting to be making the next portal game or you prolly wont complete in time
 Galactum#6235: no only 47
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Won't that take 48 hours
 Zorro#9743: last gmtk I heard the theme and then spent the first 10 hours sleeping and thinking what I should make lol
 SlamBamActionman#7160: I'm gonna keep a timer for each and every single one of you to make sure that you get 8 hours of sleep every night. It's important to take care of yourself during the jam weekend!
 Scolon#4218: Don't do it yeah
 s4br3#3746: hm yes good idea
 NULL3D "Family Friendly" Games#1203: ah ol
 DrJavaSaurus#5937: hahaha
 JuliusCube#8501: you *can*, but that would be against the spirit of the jam
nothing is stopping you from doing that though
however, i dont reccommend it
 Galactum#6235: i think it would be a good idea to download unity
 Lawn#1538: the Fire Nation attacked.
 YaBoiHammad#1204: the dev way to do it
 Changeisontwitch#9198: Nope, i'll be going to bed once the theme is out. I dream my game first
 Sol [she/her]#5527: Lol
 DrJavaSaurus#5937:  REAL devs don't prepare at all, we wait for the theme reveal, then spend 30 hours coming up with an idea, making something and then panic around 46 hours ... and then ...
 NULL3D "Family Friendly" Games#1203: nah bro im making models
 Anxeal#4160: you guys prepare?
 FryDev#0372: I don’t know how to prepare
 Changeisontwitch#9198: Well I do
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Who else is browsing the discord instead of preparing ✋
 DrJavaSaurus#5937: OK so ... LET'S GO ZELDA GAMES
 Zorro#9743: also good jam tip: go to bed and sleep
 theChief#0001: if not before it starts, it should do before the jam ends!
 YaBoiHammad#1204: im staring at the timer and its literally making me nervous for some reason
 davidnjihiahere#6326: I think the plan is: Mark likes zelda a lot. So an idea would be to focus on zelda dungeons
 Changeisontwitch#9198: Me2
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: I read this as 'patreon plebs' and was like "Yeah, that's fair"
 NULL3D "Family Friendly" Games#1203: can we create models to use before the jam
 DoctorCampbell#0545: Do you all think the jam will hit 20k signups before it starts?
 JOJO#9627: 1 hour sleep and 48 hours straight :)
 JuliusCube#8501: gibbon would be more accurate yeah
 Scolon#4218: Aye, if I can't prototype it within 1-2h I'm not gonna go go with it
 ghaith#3306: Ok thanks a LOTT everyone
 Scolon#4218: Time is ticking down so fast 😭
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: I think we've established that the discord plebs are gibbons
 Zorro#9743: my plan is to make a game I think I can do like in 2 hours lol
 Sol [she/her]#5527: Wow ok, mustve not been on when that happened
 NULL3D "Family Friendly" Games#1203: i got an idea, my cat saves the world using a deagle
 YaBoiHammad#1204: definately about your time management, it can change *everything*
 JuliusCube#8501: moderating that mustve been like trying to get a group of 30 angry ostriches to calm down
i dont know why 30 ostriches specifically but they seem like the kinda of animal to do that.
 theChief#0001: make a game you think you can make in 20-30% of __the time you have available__. Don't make a game that you think you can make in 48 hours 😉
e.g. I'm going to be spending two 8-10 hour days on this, so I'll make a game I think I can do in 4-6 hours
 Changeisontwitch#9198: Low crunch, enjoy work n stuff
 3N#2794:  time management is number one when you want to make an enjoyable and fuctioning game.
 FryDev#0372: especially making a *good* game in 48 hours
 davidnjihiahere#6326: keep scope a little low. And the design mind big
 M_Raven#4076: It *highly* depends on what you're trying to do with the game
 theChief#0001: hard, but not impossible! It's a challenge 🙂
 Changeisontwitch#9198: Its my first  GMTK and its pretty easy if your motivated
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: it's pretty hard
 ghaith#3306: Hello guys this is my first time participating in the GMTK game jam how hard is it to complete a game in 48 hours?
 Changeisontwitch#9198: Aaah
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: alas other people "enjoyed" 48 hours of inaudible talking over eachother with the occasional break for some dingus to scream the n word
 Amit.H#0786: you quickly realized that everyone was just talking over each other and nobody could understand anything.
 Sol [she/her]#5527: I rly enjoyed the voice chats, talking with other devs n such
 Changeisontwitch#9198: What about at the end
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: If you'd like a special **exclusive** voice channel only for lovely people, you can become a patron!
 Amit.H#0786: I thought the chaos of the public voicechat was fun, *at first.*
 Scolon#4218: There will be an everyone ping when the theme is announced
 Starch_Supreme#4835: LOL
 YaBoiHammad#1204: i can imagine the chaos
 Xypes#1040: is it needed to notify team members in any channel?
 Changeisontwitch#9198: If you can zoom in the quantum realm 😅
 Sol [she/her]#5527: Whaaat? ;__; I loved the voice chat
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: the public voice chats were a bad idea we all regret doing that one year
 Scolon#4218: A last minute switch seems like a really bad idea
 KadDev#8100: wow, thanks a lot, maybe I should use assets more often...
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: I probably need to lower my lowered expectations at this point
 M_Raven#4076: *Our team is still debating on whether to switch from Unity to Godot last-minute*
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: they will not!
 Starch_Supreme#4835: real life pixel art let's go
 Sol [she/her]#5527: Btw does anyone know if the voice chats will make a return?
 Scolon#4218: Yeah and make sure to lower your expectations for the jam.
 Changeisontwitch#9198: Yep
 KadDev#8100: 😮
 davidnjihiahere#6326: this is a very controversial statement
 Bart Moon#2749: I don't know how, but both
 YaBoiHammad#1204: sometimes simplicity is better
 caibi#5324: 2hours left now, are you nervous or just relex?
 R2D2Vader#0693: 😂
 SaratoninQT#3068: Asprite is what i used last year
 SpawnCampGames#8155: :F:
 unityAccount#7810: Maybe check Kenney.nl
 dardasaba#9759: Good luck xD
 Scolon#4218: Use basic shapes if all else fails
 KadDev#8100: I have 2 hours, 2 minutes and 10 seconds to learn pixel art, as I can't find a pixel artist
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: the 2 hour grace period is for if there's a problem, it isn't bonus time to work on your game, you should aim to have submitted before the 48 hours are up
 Scolon#4218: It's already counted on the length of the jam. *technically* it's a 50 hour jam
 SpawnCampGames#8155: oh ok
 Starch_Supreme#4835: upload BEFORE the jam starts 🧠
 FryDev#0372: ohhhh, that’s why it’s two extra hours long
 Bart Moon#2749: But they are counted into the jam length on itch
 R2D2Vader#0693: lmao
 Redline#7370: don't say that bc now itch will crash sooner
 Tob#1798: 👍
 Scolon#4218: I'm uploading as soon as the jam starts
 SpawnCampGames#8155: theres 2 hrs of grace right?
 Starch_Supreme#4835: What if i don't want to 😼
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Please upload BEFORE the deadline!
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: If the itch servers don't crash something has gone horribly wrong
 Anxeal#4160: make sure you can upload way before the time is up
 Starch_Supreme#4835: gmtk jam is just itchs' annual stress test :D
 SpawnCampGames#8155: everyone wait for the last 1 hr to push their build and watch the internet burn!! 😈
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Yep and still they almost always crash lol
 PepperBoi#4544: Numbers go up = good
 not without text#5469: we could still beat the number of *games* submitted instead of *participants*
 Anxeal#4160: just hoping itch.io won't crash
 Video Games Are Bad#6752: that's probably to account for the countdown yt puts on.
 FryDev#0372: 5,666 games
 Scolon#4218: The youtube video is synced to start like a few minutes before the jam actually starts I think
 unityAccount#7810: 2 hours
 Chazi b#4006: 5k I think
 PepperBoi#4544: 5k
 not without text#5469: wait how many games were submitted last year
 Dragonite#5414: Theme at 6 gmt right?
 Lawn#1538: "I didn't make a game in 48 hours, here's how"
 not without text#5469: probably, unless you can give really good ideas for the thing
 FryDev#0372: but people will also leave
 PepperBoi#4544: Well people can join after the jam starts
 davidnjihiahere#6326: would make for a sick youtube video, won't lie
 Scolon#4218: Wait we're at 19.5k? I checked a few hours ago it was 18.4k-ish
 Lawn#1538: Probably, unless you intend on learning their engine in 48 hours.
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Always good to have a backup!
 not without text#5469: 2 hours, although i see it's probably unlikely
 SlamBamActionman#7160: But the more who sign up the bigger our participant number gets, so like, sign up anyways!
 Tob#1798: personally i would
 M_Raven#4076: We're switching to an engine I know but the poll's getting mostly no's because it's also an engine not everyone else in the team knows
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Not necessary, only the person who submits the game needs to join the jam.
 TheSunCat#1007: Team members have to sign up as well? I'm signing up but making the game with a friend.
 Scolon#4218: Need to finish somethings that could potentially interrupt my dev cycle over the weekend
 nizbel#9979: Is it better to leave a team if the engine if I have no experience in the engine they decided to use?
 Tob#1798: 😂
 Wolfye#1115: all team members need to sign up?
 wyrm_slayr#7477: Lol
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Do a last minute poll for changing teams
 Merus#7019: listen, Slam, don't punish them because of me
 Tob#1798: dang
 M_Raven#4076: Watching my team make a last-minute poll for switching engines got me going 💀
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: depends how polite you all are
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: possibly
 Merus#7019: it's a good server, even though I'm on it
EDIT:Sorry for ping
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Though hey, tell your team members to sign up if they haven't already
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: How are you going to prepare?
 FryDev#0372: I think this’ll be the biggest one yet still
 SlamBamActionman#7160: We're only at 19.5k, I doubt we'll get 2k more in the last hour
 Scolon#4218: Well I'm going to make some last minute preparations
 not without text#5469: that's what they said before
 SlamBamActionman#7160: GMTK server, normally open for Patrons only all year around
 birdstone#3073: ~~i am a masochist~~ i beat all the first isle bosses on my first try blind soooo
 SlamBamActionman#7160: We had 22k people joining last year, I doubt we will beat those numbers this year
 not without text#5469: quesiton: is this the gmtk server, or the gmtk jam 2022 server
 FryDev#0372: the Cuphead dlc is really good
 Tob#1798: this is pretty much the biggest jam every year right?
 unityAccount#7810: Not sure if you can relax *playing* Cuphead but good luck
 SlamBamActionman#7160: But it's the *only* one that is bigger than ours
 MartinDew#1413: I'm so glad my company has summer schedule, we finish just in time for the game jam
In all seriousness, Global Game Jam is bigger
 davidnjihiahere#6326: oh no. Forgot about those
 hillelgo#6858: Is there a game jam bigger than this one? 20k people???
 Tob#1798: lol
 Roiboi#2055: Whoo
 SlamBamActionman#7160: It's not a GMTK jam without itch.io going down 💪
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: yeah you've just got to knuckle down and weather the storm in the first hour
 StuartXYZ#1675: i hope it does
 birdstone#3073: i'm gonna relax a bit and play cuphead or something until the jam starts, later
 SlamBamActionman#7160: It's funny, we can put like a 2 hour timer when the theme is announced and it will *still* be impossible to follow chat simply from the amount of people typing
 Tob#1798: hope fully itch page doesnt crash lol
 davidnjihiahere#6326: insert spinning pin thingy here
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Maybe you are still dreaming...
*Inception BWAAAH noise*
 KokoBird#9800: just you wait till the theme is announced
i feel like its gonna be very hectic at that moment
 birdstone#3073: lol they're gonna have a very busy day today
 Scolon#4218: I was so excited for this Jam that I woke up 3 times
 LightHouse#2571: Yep makes sens
 SlamBamActionman#7160: yuh
 JuliusCube#8501: wait why is it 30 seconds of slow mode
do the mods just randomly raise the slowmode every time it gets closer to the start of the jam?
i guess so, it makes sense why they would
 Scolon#4218: Yes
 Tob#1798: oof
 unityAccount#7810: Did you unlock the secret boss too?
 davidnjihiahere#6326: I had this plan. Forgot to execute it
 JuliusCube#8501: hi
 birdstone#3073: hello
 Scolon#4218: Wassup guys, I finished sleeping
 SlamBamActionman#7160: It's a game in-and-of-itself
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Oh god no, I have my hands full keeping an eye on all of you!
 Jeker#3389: i got 9 lol
 JuliusCube#8501: id say have enough sleep (8-10 hours). you dont always need *lots* of sleep
because for me lots is like 12 hours.
 Redline#7370: I even made a "be right back" screen for my stream so I have time to eat and stuff like that
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I only got like 8 hours last night. I wanted 10 or 12. Lol.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I need to freshen up and eat breakfast.
 StuartXYZ#1675: Hi
 Astral#7476: xD
 Redline#7370: here you can find:
- Pain
- Pain
- Not getting enough sleep
- No thoughts, head empty
 Astral#7476: Oh, thank you! I've been in the server for a bit tho, just dont speak that much haha
 Astral#7476: Hello! ^-^
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I mean, I know it'll never happen to me. I try to be nice all the time. So, I wanted to know how it'd feel.
 Hobusu#5033: Yep! I was pretty confused, haha
 DanarKayfi#0198: thanks
Good times. Lmao.
 SlamBamActionman#7160: In the channel  , youtube and itch.io
 Hobusu#5033: I remember that
 s4br3#3746: the itch io page
 Triggered#6897: Salute
 DanarKayfi#0198: where they will announce the theme?
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I asked a mod to do this to me once. It was interesting. Lol.
 Redline#7370: Getting yourself muted means the mods can't mute you anymore even if you break rules
 SlamBamActionman#7160: DM me if you change your mind
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Best I can do is 1 hour, but sure
 RedcoatsRevolt (Adam)#1185: Good luck!
 Zoro5168#0115: Please mute me for 2 hours
 Redline#7370: me after I add motion blur to my games
 Triggered#6897: Can I know the model if you don't mind.
 SlamBamActionman#7160: It's good, check it out. Here's the only reason you need:
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Aw dang
 Redline#7370: It has a lot of references but that's not one of them and no. I'm not an anime
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Hey Redline is your name in reference to Redline, the movie by studio Madhouse?
 SpawnCampGames#8155: ❤️ gl hf 
 M_Raven#4076: Turns out my keyboard's arriving next week 😭
 Cunnah#9270: right people I am going to get some shut eye see you at the start line.
 Zutilt10 | Jonathan. W#0339: It was $50. I ain't got that much money to waste
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Ready to smash it in frustration?
 Redline#7370: oke
 SpawnCampGames#8155:  all good now 🙂
 Zutilt10 | Jonathan. W#0339: Got my new keyboard just in time
 SpawnCampGames#8155: yup, just letting ya know 🙂
 FryDev#0372: I’m just using Godot and Aseprite
 Redline#7370: oh that makes sense
 Zutilt10 | Jonathan. W#0339: 2 and a half more hours
 ConstantDerivative#6302: no, the link in the description of your youtube stream, not the link for the stream itself
 Lawn#1538: At the very least, install tools that you might need. For example, I’ve got FMOD, rainbow folders/heirachy, some shaders pre-installed. Then my basic folder structure ready to go for when the theme drops.
 Redline#7370: uhh how? try restarting discord then
 ConstantDerivative#6302: same for me
 Redline#7370: no it's the right link
 SpawnCampGames#8155: it goes to brackeys i think
 Cunnah#9270:  I think there are a number of things you can do to get started. I have a fresh project in unity but thats about it where's the fun in it if your just going to get as much done before hand
 Tob#1798: hope it goes well
 Redline#7370: hmm
 Anxeal#4160: hello, I tried this game jam last year and I gave up after I failed to implement my idea. hoping to finish something this year. good luck everyone
 SpawnCampGames#8155:  the link in ur YT description is wrong i think
 Lawn#1538: That has definitely happened and we frown upon that to some degree.
 davidnjihiahere#6326: I wonder whether certain teams are already creating assets
 CALSYTHE#6648: the theme is potatos?!?!
 Cunnah#9270: I am sure there are quite a few ppl here who are already bricking it over the start time
 Zoro5168#0115: Yes according to einstens 4th dimension /j
 Cunnah#9270: yeah its probably not a good idea to start saying the thing has started when it hasn't there is still 2 and a half hours to go
 Pixstatic#3464: ... but you just said that both the future and the past are now
 SpawnCampGames#8155: if ur west of the present ur in the future 🙂
 FryDev#0372: if the future is now, then the past is the present
 Cunnah#9270: its 18:00 somewhere in the world
 Zoro5168#0115: Maybe future is already *vsauce music plays*
 Pixstatic#3464: and at 0 hours the jam might as well be over already tbh
 Triggered#6897: Physics in a sentence
 LOPSTERu#3902: that means it started omg
 SpawnCampGames#8155: just like functions are voids
 FryDev#0372: oh no! it’s started already?
 DrWorrell#7667: certainly feels that way
 SlamBamActionman#7160: 2 hours is like 1 hour, and 1 hour is like 0 hours
 Cunnah#9270: wow stumble onto the enter key in slow mode is... a mood
 Changeisontwitch#9198: Theres literally 2 and half more hours lol
 Pixstatic#3464: it's clearly a spoonerism, what they meant to say was "Lupple Zatormferps"
 Cunnah#9270: FPS jigsaw puzzel where yoiyu
 Zoro5168#0115: Zupple latormferps-only puzzle solvers will get this joke
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: yeah it actually could just be a gamejam entry lmao, my brain was fixated on broforce and how easy the brominator moves when you shoot backwards and jump for some reason
 FryDev#0372: thank you
 Pixstatic#3464: it sounds like something mark would like... great original idea !!
 SpawnCampGames#8155: it is.. there was a past GMTK entry actually that used this concept.... *weapon knockback* was how u traversed the level
 FryDev#0372: no, it’s a completely original idea
 RedcoatsRevolt (Adam)#1185: Better. Pizzas always better haha
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: doesn't this exist? it sounds REALLY familiar
 davidnjihiahere#6326: a rhythm based high speed pixel perfect platformer. Think cadence of hyrule but filled with puzzles
 SpawnCampGames#8155: yea i kinda shrugged it off too.. but my first advanced CC i made i worked on for about 6 months... and i cant say anything about theirs b/c of hypocrisy because my CC is like 1000 lines long.. and the only reason it isnt longer is cuz i finally took the time to move all the setting variables out to a scriptable object
 Pixstatic#3464: pizzas
 BurnV06#5857: Honestly considering doing that if it fits the theme
 Cunnah#9270:  high speed pixel perfect puzzler
 RedcoatsRevolt (Adam)#1185: puzzformers
 FryDev#0372: I think I’ll make a puzzle platformer where you shoot to move
 Cunnah#9270: hmm still not seeing the advantage but eh I am not exactly John Carmack so what do I know 😉
 davidnjihiahere#6326: uhhhhhh..... the jam is almost starting!!!!!! As a revenge for all the people making tough platformers, I'll make a tough puzzle game. Mwahahaha
 SpawnCampGames#8155: yes.. it was because most of the game revolved around it anyway... and they found it easier to have everything localized in one place rather than have it decoupled
 Cunnah#9270:  did they explain their thinking behind that?
 SpawnCampGames#8155: the CC code gets scrutiny tho b/c evidently its 1 single monolithic class.... but they said it was by design
 Changeisontwitch#9198: Hi!
 FryDev#0372: hmmm, I guess I can play it , I am quite a fan of platformers myself
 SpawnCampGames#8155: they released the CC code if anyone wants to study it good stuff
 ConstantDerivative#6302: yeah play celeste
 ConstantDerivative#6302: 7c especially is just, i just hate that level
 Pixstatic#3464: it's essential if you have even a slight hint of respect for 2D platformers
 PokeNinjaGuy#9592: the c-sides aren't long other than 7C (frick 7c last room)
 Among us#2308: yeah c-sides look scary 😨
 BurnV06#5857: I remember in the Celeste assist mode video MB said the devs decided to not call it "cheat mode" when there literally is a cheat mode in Celeste, it's just a seperate thing
 ConstantDerivative#6302: gl with 8b and c-sides
 FryDev#0372: I have never played Celeste
 Pixstatic#3464: I gave myself a severe carpal tunnel injury playing celeste the first time
 Among us#2308: I'm playing Celeste right now actually 👀 I'm up to the core and have beat all B-sides before it
 PokeNinjaGuy#9592: indeed it was!
 Pixstatic#3464: it's definitely a self-inflicted masochistic experience but it's fun as hell
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: remember, celeste was made in a jam too originally (which is painful to think about when you're supposed to dev a game lmao)
 ConstantDerivative#6302: amazing game, however the farewell dlc wants to make me die
 PokeNinjaGuy#9592: probably about same on the # of times played :) I also beat it in an hour and a half so- "speedrun" lets go!
 CALSYTHE#6648: I am all out of jam.
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: honestly, I understand that mentality, which is why if I wanna play a game like that again (pheonix wright comes to mind) I just don't play them for like 5 years so I forget literally everything about it lmao or I get friends to play those games and watch their playthroughs in my downtime at night
 Pixstatic#3464: I've played celeste like 20 times now, also an excellent game
 PokeNinjaGuy#9592: that's me with celeste
 Pixstatic#3464: I love it but thinking about it makes me kinda sad because I know I won't get to experience it the same way again :(
 Pixstatic#3464: oh you're barely scratching the surface 😄  - tunic is a very fun game to watch other people play through once you know it yourself
 FryDev#0372: I should probably play it
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: I've been steam sharing w a friend of mine for years, I've only managed to play an hour or so of it since he bought it, but honestly it's the kind of zelda experience I've been wanting for ages, just cryptic "figure it out" behaviour
 Cunnah#9270: actually anyone using Panda3D here?
 Pixstatic#3464: yes indeed, excellent game
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: also obligatory ask, is your profile pic from tunic?
 KadDev#8100: alright lol
 Pixstatic#3464: I'm in a server where you can voluntarily mute yourself for two hours, actually so useful (you can't unmute yourself, you gotta wait 😄 )
 BadPiggy#5202: Point
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: you too. here's hoping the theme is something interesting, so my team don't get locked down into the typical "oh god how do we make a game around this that isn't a platformer or a puzzle game"
 SlamBamActionman#7160: I'm not joking btw, let me know if you want a break from the chat for a bit 🙂 I know all too well it can be distracting haha
 Pixstatic#3464: general is too active, should be at least 3h slowmode here lol
 SpawnCampGames#8155: GL mate 🙂
 Cunnah#9270:  unless your using the Panda Engine that can just take a long walk off a short pier
 LurkNautili#3246: Thanks buddy, you da mvp
 SlamBamActionman#7160: I can just time you out for that amount if you want
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: ig, I'm just willing to wait the 30s, I have plenty of files to sift through for past assets and textures, particle effects etc. before jam theme is revealed, need everything organised from my old projects lmao (never know if you have something relevant)
 KadDev#8100: yeah, ok
 LurkNautili#3246: Honestly I wish it was like 6h so I could finally put my phone down and go grocery shopping xD I have no self control
 theChief#0001: for channels where you've got a lot of people posting self-promo stuff
 SlamBamActionman#7160: That one is for a very specific purpose. We need to control the flow of people asking for ratings somehow, otherwise people would be inclined to spam reviews everywhere.
When you post in , *make your post count*
 Among us#2308: 😨
 SpawnCampGames#8155: *ahem* Unity *ahem* j/k use whatever u feel comfortable with 🙂
 PokeNinjaGuy#9592: I remember people posted way more than one time last year
 Merus#7019: I was on a server once where the meme channel was on 24 hour slowmode
 Lawn#1538: Set it to 48 hours
 Among us#2308: It's never too late to switch! But game maker is a great engine anyway
 Cunnah#9270:  engines don't matter as much as ppl think they do
 KadDev#8100: why is there a 6 hours?
 Zayed#7379: Just edit ur message then
 BadPiggy#5202: 6h ?!?
Why is that even possible lol
 LurkNautili#3246: You wouldn't dare D=
 SpawnCampGames#8155: im referring moreso of the people that type like they take breaths
 Pixstatic#3464: lmao 
 Zoro5168#0115: Im grateful
 Merus#7019: let's you and I have a talk
 Merus#7019: crank it up to 5 minutes, Slam
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: idk I kinda understand pixstatic's statement here, I type exactly how I talk for the most part tbh, so I send like fractured messages cause that's usually when I'd take a breath, long form paragraphs are for formal places lmao
 LurkNautili#3246: Not sure why it isn't tbh
 SlamBamActionman#7160: You do know how far the slowmode timer can go, right?
 KadDev#8100: not gonna lie, sometimes I feel like I should have learnt godot instead of gamemaker studio 2, but I guess software doesn't really matter, it's about what you make of the software
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Tfw people make "Slowmode is so slow" when it's at only 30 seconds
 SpawnCampGames#8155: i was born 1 month early
 LurkNautili#3246: Ya blew it buddy
 Pixstatic#3464: it needs to be a discord feature. roll it out to partner servers first and call it "dynamic slowmode"
 Zerofaction#0367: you can only say sometying every 30 secs? I better say something important
 Wolfye#1115: everybody ready?
 SpawnCampGames#8155: post in Official Unity Discord in seperate sentences and ppl will tell u to type all info in 1 coherent paragraph 😛
 Zoro5168#0115: Im sad we didnt get a math channel
 Hederlunden#3231: slowmode is hell, i just spam the enter button as much as I can to send the next message as fast as possible, thank god i know how to jitterclick on enter... but at this rate ill get carpal tunnel
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: I've got my group in a server w a TRELLO set up for the jam so we can plan in the first hour or two then set everyone off to work and grind for the next 40 odd hours, especially since 2 of us *literally* don't sleep most of the time anyway
 Merus#7019: absolutely cursed
 LurkNautili#3246: Just write a bot to make the cooldown `1 / avg_rate` where it's an average of past minute or something 🤔
 dardasaba#9759: Lol that's exactly what the mods need on their heads now, another general channel to moderate xD
 TheSunCat#1007: #soldier-chat wen
 Merus#7019: you'll just have to think more carefully about what you say
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Just hold in shift when pressing enter and pretend you posted the message
 Triggered#6897: There can be several soldiers but one and only one general
 Thorvald#1806: This is my first as well
 Zayed#7379: Oof
We can edit though I still doubt it will work
 E0115F 101#2073: This is my first jam so I still have stuff to learn
 Zoro5168#0115: Not true at all
 Pixstatic#3464: slowmode hurts my soul as someone who spaces what they want to say across multiple messages for pacing
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: that's generally how it should be
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Expect that it will rise to several minutes at the peak of the jam starting
 SpawnCampGames#8155: i figure when the jam starts less ppl will be typing and more will be working? eh?
 Cunnah#9270: 30 seconds isn't a massive ammount of time wow, attention spans guys 🙂
 KadDev#8100: yeah
 Coffe#5594: can we open up a second general chat too?
 dardasaba#9759: It will most likely only get longer the closer we get to the jam xD
 SlamBamActionman#7160: The slowmode will be set to be appropriate for the channel message speed
 SpawnCampGames#8155: u learned from past experience tho right? should go smoothly this time 🍀
 Zoro5168#0115: Savage
 Yollie#2239: NOT THE SLOWMODE? Wait just so I know it will be faster during the jam right?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: And that's how you land a timeout
 KadDev#8100: although my last jam went horribly
 E0115F 101#2073: Rip typing fast
 Redline#7370: sounds about the right thing
 SpawnCampGames#8155: inb4 the 30
 Zayed#7379: Nooooooo
But we can edit right
 Zoro5168#0115: Thats ok
 KadDev#8100: but i'm excited for the jam to start
 Cunnah#9270:  I think that will be a bit on the nose
 Redline#7370: NOO YOLLIE WHYY
 BadPiggy#5202: That's my idea. I call theft
 Galse#8611: I mean, the theme will get announced for me at 14:00, but for people one time zone ahead it will get announced at a different time.
 Merus#7019: jam guessing to  please
 Redline#7370: I'll stick to my 2L of tea/day
 ◈・ Altaꐟ#9999: for example fear is you're weapon
 Zoro5168#0115: Chaos will ensue soon
 Zayed#7379: It just means that for me it's 10pm time start
 BadPiggy#5202: Aye, give it a few more lines of text and no one will care lol
 ZedDev#4726: What would i do without Gnirehtet
 Cunnah#9270: ohh make a game in blender itself theres a fun one
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Caffeine pills and adderall for you
 Zayed#7379: Ik
 E0115F 101#2073: I'm using pygame because I hate myself
 japson#4917: wait what that doesn't depend on your timezone though haha
 KadDev#8100: people are gonna think I actually said something XD
 Merus#7019: what if you agreed to mod the jam channels
 Galse#8611: You remember me my guy?
 Zayed#7379: Totally understand
 Cunnah#9270: Anyone here using some odd ball game engine to make there game on?
 BadPiggy#5202: Yo Galse
 KadDev#8100: oh my gosh
 Galse#8611: In 3 hours. ( Depends on your timezone* )
 Triggered#6897: This looks like a job for me
 SpawnCampGames#8155: see how much extra work u made for the guys giving us this great opportunity to jam...
 ◈・ Altaꐟ#9999: 8
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Jokes aside, keep low-effort jokes to 
 Pixstatic#3464: now it's been deleted it looks even worse
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: theme announcement is 6 right?
 KadDev#8100: yes indeed
 ◈・ Altaꐟ#9999: yes
 KerimcanT#0088: ||boobs||
 BadPiggy#5202: They're coming up with new ways to Rick roll us
***They're evolving***
 SlamBamActionman#7160: You get to live, this time
 KadDev#8100: sorry
 SpawnCampGames#8155: 🤦‍♂️
 E0115F 101#2073: best reply
 Yollie#2239: 😳
 Jellogramming#4653: woah slow down there I don't think that's legal
 ◈・ Altaꐟ#9999: we can delete that just dont ban us
 japson#4917: not even a rick roll I'm disappointed
 Pixstatic#3464: You did *what* to your neighbour's dog?
 SpawnCampGames#8155: lol
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Don't make my mod job any harder than it needs to be
 s4br3#3746: bruh i got jebaited by this
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Bruh pls
 terrysaw#9401: Is that even legal?
 SpawnCampGames#8155: whooooa dude... not cool
 ◈・ Altaꐟ#9999: OMG What ??!?
 Yollie#2239: Bro you can’t say that here that’s hella racist 💀
 E0115F 101#2073: you can't say that what the hell
 SpawnCampGames#8155: thats fair, im not condoning anyone to depriving themselves of sleep.. but all nighters arent uncommon for me... just my strat
 Cunnah#9270: unless what your working on is really brain dead work
 Yollie#2239: Watch the theme be magnetism or something
 LurkNautili#3246: Maybe I'll do 8 hours total before Monday
 Zayed#7379: Hacker
 Cunnah#9270:  I just can't do that, but also I think you achieve more being rested than trying to stay awake
 ◈・ Altaꐟ#9999: are we ready ?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: I too am into having 8 hours of sleep
 SpawnCampGames#8155: im gonna pull atleast 1 all nighter.. seems legit
 E0115F 101#2073: 😳
 LurkNautili#3246: Try me, I'm *into* that shit
 SpawnCampGames#8155: well good nite then 😛
 Yollie#2239: Though if I sleep at 3 am I might wake up wayyy to late ngl
 RedcoatsRevolt (Adam)#1185: Look at the theme, write down some stuff, sleep on it
 Salmon 🐟#7615: Just realized the jam starts at 6 and not 8 this year?
 Yollie#2239: Unfortunately my regular sleep schedule is sleeping at 2am so it doesn’t change much
 SlamBamActionman#7160: If anyone pulls an all-nighter I will drive to their house and chloroform them
 Pixstatic#3464: everybody has to get 2 nights of sleep sometime during the jam, doesn't give you a disadvantage
 Triggered#6897: I wish i could understand pokemon lang.
 BadPiggy#5202: Got to sleep lol.
 LurkNautili#3246: Staying in your regular sleep schedule would be easiest
 ZedDev#4726: 🤔
 SpawnCampGames#8155: see the theme and sleep on it  would be what id do
 Pixstatic#3464: go to beeedddd
 LurkNautili#3246: If you're solo it makes no difference
 BadPiggy#5202: I have gotten insider info
The theme is " pig "
 ZedDev#4726: Oh it finally finished creating the project
 Yollie#2239: What do you guys think. Should I stay up til 3 am to see the theme or should I sleep at wait for tomorrow
 Redline#7370: ah thanks for reminding me
 SpawnCampGames#8155: ohh well i mean i clicked the little button first time i used it 
 Pixstatic#3464: I got all my visuals roughly working so that I have an idea of performance and then I deleted everything so that I could get the fresh feeling of an empty scene
 LurkNautili#3246: All we did do far was a blank UE5 project with FMOD installed
 ZedDev#4726: Why isn't TMP imported by default
 Pixstatic#3464: use your discretion
 SpawnCampGames#8155: i set up my entire project with all my dependencies... probuilder, textmesh pro, DoTween, Cinemachine, post processing, etc and built first
 Pixstatic#3464: it's pretty much anything goes before the jam so long as you aren't producing new content
 LurkNautili#3246: I set up my gitlab years ago so I hope so
 ZedDev#4726: Yeah why not
 Galse#8611: Setting up GitHub stuff is okay before the jam right?
 ZedDev#4726: 12 minutes, still importing
 SpawnCampGames#8155: tried out Odin?
 ZedDev#4726: I tried serializing a struct before but i only recently learned that you need to use `[System.Serializable]` for that
 SpawnCampGames#8155: optimization is post jam problems
 LurkNautili#3246: Welcome to the space jam
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: Yeah I wouldn't worry too much about optimization here, if it works it works
 Lawn#1538: Let the Slammening commence.
 SpawnCampGames#8155: well.. maybe not a death error.. but it might be in a standalone.
 Triggered#6897: Mod is back in action
 LurkNautili#3246: Can't think of a counterexample
 caibi#5324: btw, it's not a death errors, I can still play it without any movement problem.
 SpawnCampGames#8155: u can serialize almost everything
 Pixstatic#3464: a CharacterController variable is serialisable?
 japson#4917: maybe jump to tech help too 😄
 Redline#7370: also  lol
 Triggered#6897: Try getcomponent thing
 Redline#7370: pro tip: it's not serialiseable
 caibi#5324: ofc
 Pixstatic#3464: are you putting a CharacterController into it in the editor?
 SpawnCampGames#8155: is the slot populated?
 Cunnah#9270: Begone! lol 😉
 caibi#5324: public CharacterController controller;
how is this not asigned?
 N8#2718: epic - i use threejs
 SpawnCampGames#8155: singletons ftw
 ZedDev#4726: Honnestly i never use the editor to assign references unless they are on different gameobjects. And even if, i can just use a static reference
 caibi#5324: oof
 dardasaba#9759: Nah if you have a browser build that's enough
 japson#4917: I think you need to assign the controller variable of the movement script in the inspector 🙂
 Triggered#6897: At least one of these
 SpawnCampGames#8155: if its playable on the web its playable on windows
 LurkNautili#3246: Yeah that's the whole point of glfw
 N8#2718: does it need to be playable on windows if its playable on the web?
 TheSunCat#1007: I'm using my own game engine (just using GLFW pretty much, which says is compatible with Windows)
 ZedDev#4726: Unity still creating the project
 SpawnCampGames#8155: then you probably need to assign the controller variable of the movement script in the inspector 😈
 dardasaba#9759: I don't see why not (if you're using an engine)
 Zayed#7379: Yeah
So no android game
 caibi#5324: fuck that shit
 LurkNautili#3246: Yeah
 caibi#5324: I'm already assign the fucking Character Controller, but stupid unity tell me "UnassignedReferenceException: The variable controller of Movement has not been assigned.
You probably need to assign the controller variable of the Movement script in the inspector."
 TheSunCat#1007: Can I build for Windows from Linux?
 SpawnCampGames#8155: sure.. just change the input around
 Cunnah#9270:  I love horror but jump scares aren't horror. I have a massive fight or flight response leaning more to the fight end so they just ain't good for me
 Zayed#7379: So that means no
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: Idk if you can also port it to android tho
 TheSunCat#1007: uh oh
 FryDev#0372: James
 CALSYTHE#6648: GAME JAMES
 ZedDev#4726: heck now i can even stay in the dark 24 hours and it won't phase me
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: It's *needs* to be playable on Windows
 ZedDev#4726: I lost any fear by watching horror games for months
 Lawn#1538: But also, you will definitely hear about it right here when it happens.
 SpawnCampGames#8155: but i guess if u do more than 1 or 2 levels it makes up for the initialization
 SpawnCampGames#8155: yea im not a 2d expert but i know what u mean.. just asking if u use tilesets in general... i find them time consuming to set up
 RedcoatsRevolt (Adam)#1185: I'm excited to play everyone's games but I am a baby when it comes to horror. I will play them anyway because someone took time to make it
 ShockingShots#6969: GMTK's YouTube channel
 Vii13#1424: k thx
 Triggered#6897: Soon you will launch a fairy tale game
 Pixstatic#3464: youtub
 Cat Sydromde#8405: I think this I'd the first jam where I make a 2D game
 Vii13#1424: where will the theme announced ?
 ZedDev#4726: In unity, RuleTiles basically change their sprite depending on their neighbours
 Zayed#7379: Is it ok to create an android game for the game jam
 ZedDev#4726: I have like 10 games in my head with interesting limitations
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: Because I know that anything I'll come up with rn will prob not fit the theme
 SpawnCampGames#8155: u mean u used tilesets? i always forgo this for jams.. i think its faster to vertex snap
 Cunnah#9270: I am not a mod so ask them I think
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: Yeah I'm waiting for the theme before I think up all sorts of ideas
 Cunnah#9270:  just be aware the rules state that it needs to be accessible for everyone I think they want low gore/horror
 ZedDev#4726: I tried Ludum dare 50 but i didn't know Rule tiles existed, and school (exam preparations) took most of my time
 SpawnCampGames#8155: id say let the theme chose the genre for ya
 LurkNautili#3246: It would appear none of you are moving at or away from me at any notable fraction of c
 Pixstatic#3464: what? we have so much in common!
 SpawnCampGames#8155: well ill be damned
 Cunnah#9270: I have to sleep before it starts not going to go well otherwise
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Wow what a coincidence!
 Among us#2308: Surprisingly, me too!
 LurkNautili#3246: Reference frame twins hype?
 Pixstatic#3464: I'm just gonna drop everything into a powerpoint and go to sleep
 SpawnCampGames#8155: oh hey me too!
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: Oh hey same haha
 Among us#2308: oh wow good luck
 ZedDev#4726: i could probably sleep only 3 hours and last a full day no problem
 Redline#7370: sleep is the funny thing you do when you close your eyes for a long time
 Pixstatic#3464: I have a design assignment I gotta finish so I don't fail an entire school course 😢
 SpawnCampGames#8155: game design iteration with ur eyes closed 
 N8#2718: your really gonna be that picky about grammar other than you'res?
 Tapu#9161: Starts at 11pm for me
 LurkNautili#3246: For me the jam starts in a bit over 3 hours
 Among us#2308: or don't its up to you lmao
 ZedDev#4726: What's sleep?
 Among us#2308: Go to sleep now so you can jam earlier
 Hederlunden#3231: 7pm
 SpawnCampGames#8155: are u jamming?
 Pixstatic#3464: I'm going to bed sometime in the next hour so not really
 Among us#2308: 1.AM here is SA
 ZedDev#4726: 5PM
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: 7 PM here as well
 Pixstatic#3464: like one with a keypad I'd have to assume
 Lawn#1538: 3 am for east coast Australians.
 skejeton#5788: 8pm
 Among us#2308: dedication
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: 7 pm here, which is nice.
 SpawnCampGames#8155: lets just assume im texting on a telephone 
 Cunnah#9270: 18:00 for me
 Pixstatic#3464: starts at 3 am for me
 Among us#2308: For me the jam starts at 1.AM
 SpawnCampGames#8155: lmao 😢
 Pixstatic#3464: aslongudont
 Triggered#6897: Yep I can see that
 SpawnCampGames#8155: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 N8#2718: gonna just use my saturday to throw together a quick project
 Among us#2308: your right
 SpawnCampGames#8155: as long u dont put "your" for "you're" ill overlook almost all grammar/spelling errors 😄
 N8#2718: pretty cool that the jam is happebning
 ZedDev#4726: I'll make a huge assumption and make a 2D project
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: hello o/
 Pixstatic#3464: There's an Among us among us
 Redline#7370: sus
 Among us#2308: Hello guys! 👋
 LurkNautili#3246: It is but often used wrong
 SpawnCampGames#8155: is reoccuring not correct? 🤔  😈
 dardasaba#9759: Plain old .exe **and** .x86_64, right? Right??! :(
 ZedDev#4726: i can't test WebGL without switching to MacOS since the Hardware acceleration works best there
 Redline#7370: that's not a really good idea, speaking from experience
 LurkNautili#3246: It's like "reoccurring"
 Tapu#9161: Well just normal game ideas that I think could be bodged together for the theme
 Pixstatic#3464: you cheeky son of a bitch
 SpawnCampGames#8155: u like that dont ya? 😛 i always see if imma get a comment on it 😄
 Lascif#0184: If it ain't WebGL you'll lose people because they won't want to download it because it's extra time, effort and risk
 SpawnCampGames#8155: just now? madlabs 🤣
 Pixstatic#3464: "irregardless" would turn off more people let's be real
 LurkNautili#3246: Web builds are a bit safer though with the sandboxing
 Redline#7370: from what?
 ZedDev#4726: I'm gonna start unity and import stuff
 SpawnCampGames#8155: (irregardless) having mic access would turn off abunch of ppl..
 Tapu#9161: I got like 10 different ideas but I neither have time nor ability to make them
 SpawnCampGames#8155: yea but im sayin ill take a risk but not open myself up to *all* of em
 LurkNautili#3246: You run code that you don't trust, you're already pwned
 Redline#7370: how do you have ideas without knowing the theme, it makes no sense
 LurkNautili#3246: There is no seat belt in this analogy
 SpawnCampGames#8155: still... u can get killed driving a car but i still wear a seatbelt
 Redline#7370: someone did it on a graphing calculator, but that doesn't mean that we should do the same
 DrWorrell#7667: yeah, i for one don't like things wanting mic and webcam access
 ZedDev#4726: Dude i played gameboy games on my calculator
 Tapu#9161: Just sign up no special steps needed
 theChief#0001: just signing up is enough 🙂
 LurkNautili#3246: I mean you're downloading and executing a file from the internet already...
 Cunnah#9270:  I will have you know that someone got raytracing to work on SNES hardware anything is possible if your mad enough 😄
 ZedDev#4726: A lot of horrog games use the mic
 Tapu#9161: What if I add a way to make noises using sliders as an accessibility "feature"?
 SwivelDev (He/Him)#4259: True
 SpawnCampGames#8155: its not that.. im not gonna allow an unknown publisher to access my mic
 skejeton#5788: twenty's plenty (seconds per frame)
 ZedDev#4726: Teardown exists
 SwivelDev (He/Him)#4259: Well most devices nowadays come with a microphone but some people still dont have one
 Redline#7370: none of which would run on anyone's computer
 Pixstatic#3464: mic is more common than webcam but still seems like it risks breaking the rules
 Catfish#2063: game engine
 SpawnCampGames#8155: i wont allow ur games permissions ;P
 Pixstatic#3464: nope it says no webcam so I would assume no mic either
 RedcoatsRevolt (Adam)#1185: that's cool! Excited to hear updates
 ZedDev#4726: Path tracing is an option or cpu rtx
 Tapu#9161: Is using microphone allowed? Is it even special hardwy?
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: welp bacco to drawing more mods. I'm bored.
 Redline#7370: which means no RTX games sadly
 Clive Dev#0446: o, lol okay
 theChief#0001: keep countdowns to  please
 Pixstatic#3464: no special hardware can be required to play the game as per rules
 ZedDev#4726: In my game yeah, but its pain working on
 SpawnCampGames#8155: yea.. even if it wasn't u gotta think about ur demographic.. not everyone owns a headset... very few likely.. ud be asking for a drastic reduction of views/ ratings
 LurkNautili#3246: I thought we were talking about VR games in jams in general
 SwivelDev (He/Him)#4259: Well I think you can have Gamepad support as long as its not required
 Cunnah#9270: if it makes sense I am going to include game pad mappings but as an option
 Lascif#0184: At the end of the day you want a game that's easy to just load up and play so anybody can play and review it.
 Pixstatic#3464: it specifically states no exclusively vr games are allowed
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: isn't that not allowed? Since it's in the rules nothing but a keyboard and mouse is allowed.
 RedcoatsRevolt (Adam)#1185: omg I love JSAB. There's a level editor?
 Cunnah#9270:  isn't it also against the rules for it to be VR
 LurkNautili#3246: Oh
 Pixstatic#3464: it says not to make vr games on the jam page
 SpawnCampGames#8155: they just run better too
 LurkNautili#3246: Making a VR game is just asking for 0 reviews I think, dunno if anyone has risked that before
 ZedDev#4726: i'll do both
If i finish my game of course
 Pixstatic#3464: like thanks I know that ambient occlusion doesn't work on webgl thanks unity you don't need to fill the console with hundreds of errors until I delete the library folder
 Cunnah#9270: I am going to make an executable rather than a web player since I have a better understanding of those
 ZedDev#4726: prob used a platform exclusive thing and unity disliked it
 SwivelDev (He/Him)#4259: Yeah if it's webgl any desktop platform can play it
 ZedDev#4726: never had that issue
 Pixstatic#3464: I'm just hoping nobody needs to download my game because I'm not fucking with unity just killing itself when I switch platforms
 SpawnCampGames#8155: or at all tbh
 Lawn#1538: Duplicates are the way. You don’t want to end up in  all jam.
 SpawnCampGames#8155: duplicated project and converted wouldnt be wise for a jam type time constraint i wouldnt imagine
 SpawnCampGames#8155: ^ just do that.. to avoid any issues
 ZedDev#4726: You can change the platform without doing that
 Dric#2439: if its Unity duplicate the folder where your project is and then convert the copy to the desired export platform... at least that's how i did it...
 SwivelDev (He/Him)#4259: And when you build you can choose
 ZedDev#4726: The VR version came later tho
 SwivelDev (He/Him)#4259: Go into unity hub and get the WebGL and Windows platform export modules
 Jeker#3389: ok so, generating good procedural levels will be hard
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Superhot started as a game jam game but idk if it was a VR jam or not
 SpawnCampGames#8155: ^ and dont go crazy with the shaders if u plan for webGL to work w/o giving u troubles
 japson#4917: yeah but it was an IRL jam so it was easier to test 😅
 ZedDev#4726: You have to make sure you have the modules first tho
 ZedDev#4726: When you build you can choose
 SpawnCampGames#8155: it is ull have to build to standalone. and then build for webGL
 Big Cheese#7612: i think its a setting in the top left of unity
 ZedDev#4726: Has there been a VR game in a jam ever? (VR game jams not included)
 SpawnCampGames#8155: 2 builds
 Atemit#4061: guys, how do i make my game both downloadable and also palyable on the browser?
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: 🤏 🐁
 SpawnCampGames#8155: *flashbacks of Guitar Hero*
 Big Cheese#7612: i was thinking le festin
 japson#4917: draw the pic with ascii
 DrWorrell#7667: great, now i hear free bird playing in my head
 Arfilish#8729: sadly it is't
 redve#6507: I found something about flag use_mpg123, but i don't know will it work properly
 Big Cheese#7612: 🇳 🇮 🇨 🇪
 japson#4917: pics? 😮 not sure if it's allowed here though
 Catfish#2063: trying something
 Arfilish#8729: I'm holding a rat
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Anyhow- jam soon :3
 redve#6507:  did you find something with mp3 files?
 Catfish#2063: best wishes mate
 DrWorrell#7667: I thought you were talking about the game jam. I agree, you can never be to young to get help if you need it.
 ZedDev#4726: i'm on the level editor
 ZedDev#4726: I'm working on a JSAB/Project Arrithmia kinda game
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: here it isn't, some kids can be 6 and still talk to a physologist
 japson#4917: never too young to have help when you need it ! 🙂
 Cunnah#9270:  I started at 30 but I haven't made anything big yet 🙂
 LurkNautili#3246: No age is too young to care for your mental health, that's (pardon the pun) crazy
 PokeNinjaGuy#9592: I think you should go to one if you **need one** not based on age
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Nope i'm not, here anyone even very young kids talk to physologists.
 Catfish#2063: am 17 too
 Catfish#2063: i meant the psychologis
 ZedDev#4726: for some reasons most of the game devs or mod devs i heard about (a while ago) started at 16, including me
 DrWorrell#7667: there is no such thing as too young... unless you are younger then 13
 PokeNinjaGuy#9592: 13+ for discord
 LurkNautili#3246: I think 13 is the requirement
 Catfish#2063: aren't u too young for this(psychologist)?
 PokeNinjaGuy#9592: fellow zoomer sadge
 SpawnCampGames#8155: lmao!
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: 16 turning 17 this sunday :) life's been a mess this year. Gonna try to enjoy this weekend tho :D
 LurkNautili#3246: A reasonable thing to hear from someone named catfish xD
 ZedDev#4726: One day OpenAI will make a text to game AI
 Catfish#2063: ah sorry for u, how old r u?
 japson#4917: hah roleplaying a game idea is next level
 SpawnCampGames#8155: *sniffs air* what smells like burnt rubber?
 Catfish#2063: ya about that my brain comitted suicicide(suicide) already
 LurkNautili#3246: Oh right, gotta choose the meal based on the game design for immersion... Good thing I live right next to the shop for adjustments when the game is live
 Jeker#3389: i did, its an amazing game
 ZedDev#4726: Anyone ever played Ultrakill?
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I'm excited for the theme announcement and I got an appointment made with my physologist today at 8 (hour after jam starts) so yay doing something for my mental health.
 ChipmunkDev#1808: prepped? confident? right... uh yeah...
 ZedDev#4726: Unity runs on anything if there are no shadows or extremely complex stuff
 Triggered#6897: ~~We are excluding all the garbage out rn so the mind is clear for the jam~~
 SpawnCampGames#8155: b/c we're already prepped... / confident/ we're just procrastinating until the buzzer
 Catfish#2063: why not?
 japson#4917: sounds just like a project zomboid meal lol
 LurkNautili#3246: Maybe throwing in some protein bars
 ZedDev#4726: Just joined mini jam 111, i'm gonna participate in as much jam i can before september
 Catfish#2063: just chiling + why isn't anone(anyone) talking about the gmtk game jam that is just starting in like 3h from now
 SpawnCampGames#8155: i feel the stress starting to rise! how are you 🙂
 LurkNautili#3246: I'm thinking.... Peanuts and beer this weekend
 Arfilish#8729: Even Godot?
 SeanSS#0892: My laptop shits itself when I open anything other than unity
 SpawnCampGames#8155: hotpockets && mountain dew!!
 Jeker#3389: use vim keybindings lol
 caibi#5324: oof
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: How's everyone doing on this lovely friday?
 Redline#7370: me when I open:
chrome, file explorer, discord
photoshop, OBS, blender, Premiere
Unity and my stream chat
16gb of RAM go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
 LurkNautili#3246: Don't forget to go grocery shopping for like meal replacements or whatever -- gotta minimize time away from keyboard 🤔
 Jeker#3389: hey mate
 Lawn#1538: DM me maps though. I’m always down.
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: heyoo :D
 Cunnah#9270:  yeah I can see that
 caibi#5324: you are right, 100% GPU and 98% CPU
 SpawnCampGames#8155: its a rabbit hole..
 PokeNinjaGuy#9592: woah really! small world
 Lawn#1538: You cannot unfortunately. Fortunate for mods though, this place would be chaos with images.
 Jeker#3389: back when it was owned by macromedia
 ChipmunkDev#1808: my first game was remixed off of a scratch game of yours
 ZedDev#4726: i need to make more Unity Editor tools to help me
 Lawn#1538: 💯 the devil is in the details
 Cunnah#9270:  not sure if I can share images on this discussion
 Maksu#4798: i started with WarioWare D.I.Y (based game)
 LurkNautili#3246: Those are rookie numbers, you gotta pump up those numbers
 caibi#5324: only itch.io counter, trello and google translate opened.
 Jeker#3389: nice, i started with flash 8
 SpawnCampGames#8155: i started with Flash MX 😈
 ZedDev#4726: i have 5 at max
 PokeNinjaGuy#9592: same with mario maker tbh
 LurkNautili#3246: Imagine not having at least a couple hundred tabs open
 SeanSS#0892: Then there's me: who started out with mario maker
 Redline#7370: start your finished game, and those percentages will jump up quite high
 Cunnah#9270:  oh yeah I also have made a few maps for fantasy projects
 Maksu#4798: godot runs on basically anything, as long as it's from this century
 ZedDev#4726: Use edge if you want chromium but less ram usage
 BadPiggy#5202: I've seen a lot of Devs who started out with map and level design in FPS games lol
 Lawn#1538: Ahh game maps. Not carto maps.
 PokeNinjaGuy#9592: lmfao
 SpawnCampGames#8155: ur chrome doesnt use 70+ % ??? interesting 🤣
 Cunnah#9270:  GIS?
 Redline#7370: I updated mostly bc of the new epic HDRP features like volumetric clouds and lens flares
 Cunnah#9270:  yeah, started with quake maps, half-life. Did a few for half-life alyx. Also helped on larger projects for ARMA.
 ZedDev#4726: 2021 is cool but i won't use it much until i get a new computer
 BadPiggy#5202: As long as it works kek
 Redline#7370: I used 2020.somethingsomething for quite a while, but recently I updated and didn't regret
 SeanSS#0892: Just have the default cube as your player character ez
 ZedDev#4726: I'm on a 2007 Imac running windows 7
 Lawn#1538: You’re a map guy too? (GIS that is)
 ChipmunkDev#1808: something i never thought i'd hear
 Cunnah#9270: yeah, tons of mapping experience has taught me that its the details that eat your time
 BadPiggy#5202: Unity 2018 and 2019 work well
 ZedDev#4726: 2020 is all i need
 ZedDev#4726: i won't even bother with unity 2021, my computer hates it. 2022 won't even run
 Maksu#4798: i see, it's been more than a year since i've joined gmtk jam, i forgot lol
 Lawn#1538: I think this is why it’s so important to prioritise finishing your main game loop in the first few hours.
 JuliusCube#8501: 10 minutes but yeah
 DrWorrell#7667: well, there isn't much here for non patrons
 japson#4917: oh jeesh yeah right x)
 ChipmunkDev#1808: i think it was 10 minutes
 Triggered#6897: These are for supepowered individuals like flash
 Redline#7370: wasn't it 10 minutes?
 BadPiggy#5202: Technically you'll be YEETed
 Maksu#4798: last year i joined the server and left when the jam was done, this year will be the same
 japson#4917: wasn't it brackeys literally remaking hexagon in 1 hour?  😄
 PokeNinjaGuy#9592: pain
 Cunnah#9270:  even if you don't finish just having the time limit will amaze you how it can help you focus down on game design
 Redline#7370: I've been on a 3 day long jam, unless you overscope really hard you will have enough time
 JuliusCube#8501: thats really easy i could probably do that in an hour
except with a couple extra bugs
 ChipmunkDev#1808: there exists a jam lasting 0 hours
 Jeker#3389: oh wait were you the guy that did that video on youtube?
 ZedDev#4726: yeah
 Pixstatic#3464: so you remade slope lol
 Triggered#6897: There exists a jam lasting 2hours
 Arfilish#8729: More fun thing there that in first i was in solo while in second i was in team...
 ChipmunkDev#1808: I think that stems from polishing the game and it being a short timeframe
 japson#4917: **saved**
 ZedDev#4726: i mean, i made slope in a day
 benjammin1391#7257: 2 days is tight
 JuliusCube#8501: this seems like a parody video so ill give you the pass on that
 ZedDev#4726: i'm a beginner (i think?) so 2 days is not a lot
 Arfilish#8729: This is my third 2 days jam. First was successful, second was failed
 Cunnah#9270: fun fact I have noticed about what seems to do well is not nessarilly an amazing new mechanic but having a mechanic and then going ok how far can I push it
 Lawn#1538: Previous themes:
 Jeker#3389: i am currently finishing up my notes on walker generation
 ZedDev#4726: yeah depending on the theme i may not participate
 japson#4917: I feel called out 🥲  I really *did *make pokemon is 6minutes though 😶‍🌫️
 Pixstatic#3464: you *just* noticed this?
 ZedDev#4726: I just noticed that the jam lasts 2 days o_o
 SeanSS#0892: Joined together I think
 PokeNinjaGuy#9592: "Joined together"
 Triggered#6897: What was the last jam
 benjammin1391#7257: 4 hours to go right? This is my first jam in like a decade.
 Cunnah#9270: anyone else crawling through past GMTK jam devlogs?
 Redline#7370: 🤔
 ChipmunkDev#1808: i see no other way
 Pixstatic#3464: I'll play it and rate it proportionally to price
 Triggered#6897: Negative stars
 SeanSS#0892: Do it I'll play it and give 5 stars trust
 SpawnCampGames#8155: *smiles in pirate*
 Redline#7370: (no clickbait)
 Jeker#3389: I mean, if it fits them not really
 PokeNinjaGuy#9592: lmao
 LurkNautili#3246: If I set the payment to a negative number, is it considered bribery and against the rules?
 Kendo#2848: oke thanks
 swarm#1128: Sorry but you'll have to pay to play my game. It's that good.
 Pixstatic#3464: glad jdh gets some appreciation
 SpawnCampGames#8155: ^ then theres a chance u get payment and it'll just sit there for itch to tax 😄
 PokeNinjaGuy#9592: I made a AAA game in 24 hours that normally would be made in years by hundreds of people! (real)
 Redline#7370: or pay what you want with a minimum of 0$
 SpawnCampGames#8155: *select $0 or nopayment*
 JuliusCube#8501: jdh's take on it is fine because he made the stuff from scratch.
 Lawn#1538: No. You can set it to zero.
nope, no you did not.
 SpawnCampGames#8155: nope
 Kendo#2848: i have to set up payment on itch for people to download the game?
 Lawn#1538: Noice. This jam is basically Juice Jam for me.
 Cunnah#9270: 🙂
 Redline#7370: well good luck I guess
 ChipmunkDev#1808: check out jdh's take on it
 Cunnah#9270:  It can, colour theory and composition still count for a lot. trick is to make it not look to muddy
 Pixstatic#3464: I have a sick as style nailed down already so I'm comfortable knowing my game is going to be pretty as hell ✨
 SpawnCampGames#8155: just do ur thang, then put a pixelated blip/ render pass over the game
 Arfilish#8729: Someone could misheard and misread this and make game about WW2.
With cubic style
 JuliusCube#8501: in 24 hours like those crappy youtube videos
"omg guys I made MINECRAFT in 24 HOURS"
like shut up no you fucking didnt you made a voxel game in unity with a fraction of the features and a fraction of what makes minecraft minecraft
 Redline#7370: yes but that won't look too great I imagine
 Pixstatic#3464: UH OH
 PokeNinjaGuy#9592: or MEIN CRAFT!
 Triggered#6897: What about yourcraft instead
 Cunnah#9270:  depends, if I go a PS1 style I have a whole selection of sausage shapes for making characters in my blender file.
 Hederlunden#3231: it's cool tho, really trippy
 SeanSS#0892: Jam on who can make the best minecraft
 Cunnah#9270: wow suddenly had de-ja-vu
 PokeNinjaGuy#9592: fair, python is my second best language, much better in c# at this point
 Redline#7370: yep but in 2D you can do way more copy pasting then it 3d + 2D is way more lightweight
 SeanSS#0892: Minecraft Jam when?
 Cunnah#9270:  true but I am faster doing 3d art than 2D art (unless I am going for that programer art chic)
 Big Cheese#7612: it felt more like a dark lull though
 Lawn#1538: Please keep countdowns to 
 JuliusCube#8501: just make minecraft 2
 PokeNinjaGuy#9592: it really isn't
 Hederlunden#3231: aight sure
 Pixstatic#3464: I started learning scratch, got bored, went to gamemaker, got bored, went to unity, got bored, went to shaders, got bored, and finally landed on python for anything I make that isn't a videogame
 SpawnCampGames#8155: how is that even a comparison? 😛
 SeanSS#0892: Good luck good sir
 Redline#7370: probably not but it really depends on the theme
 PokeNinjaGuy#9592: unity is so good compared to scratch lmfao
 LurkNautili#3246: Oh no I'm a monster 😭
 Triggered#6897: Give a gun to a samurai
 Big Cheese#7612: we fixed the sleeping schedule
 Arfilish#8729: I'll go with Unreal Engine. With C++.
 SpawnCampGames#8155: welcome to the light side
 PokeNinjaGuy#9592: then moved to unity and have been for years now
 Hederlunden#3231: why is it a horrible idea
 Lawn#1538: Probably.
 JuliusCube#8501: last time i tried that it was a horrible idea, no.
 BadPiggy#5202: People do it even at 18-19 lol
 PokeNinjaGuy#9592: I started learning python, thought wth am I typing and started learning scratch
 Hederlunden#3231: yes solo, being in a team is probably pretty cringe (idk, never tried it)
 LurkNautili#3246: Am I being mean to our artists by making them use gitlab? D=
 SpawnCampGames#8155: <
 Cunnah#9270: Any solos going 3D?
 PokeNinjaGuy#9592: lmao
 JuliusCube#8501: im a solo dev yeah
 BadPiggy#5202: I'ma solo this jam no cap
 SeanSS#0892: Ayo solo devs rise up
 Pixstatic#3464: if you weren't making shitty contributions to open source projects that nobody needed at the age of 11 I don't even want to talk to you
 Arfilish#8729: It's me. At least currently
 RedcoatsRevolt (Adam)#1185: solo squaaaad
 Tapu#9161: "I'm eating this on your behalf"
 Redline#7370: 🖐️
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: They sent me the money and now I'm distributing it to the rest of the team. Lol.
 Cunnah#9270:  yep
 SpawnCampGames#8155: same, let us millenials show what a clutch game jam submission looks like "muahaha"
 PokeNinjaGuy#9592: 🤚
 JuliusCube#8501: getting closer
 SeanSS#0892: Any solo devs???? 👀
 LurkNautili#3246: Programming all my life though ^^
 JuliusCube#8501: nope
 LurkNautili#3246: I only started working in SD at 25 myself so... 5 years here
 Lawn#1538: Or did they just buy pizza for each person, but got them delivered to themselves.
 Triggered#6897: ~~I asked before and I'll ask again any more room in your team~~
 theChief#0001: maybe not PRs at 10, but certainly by 13/14ish 😂
 Cunnah#9270:  I am a millenial as it happens
 Jeker#3389: I mean, my artists didnt have the most smooth expirience with git, so i made like an easier interface for them
 JuliusCube#8501: Im x years old where x ∈ ℕ
 nobodyuknow#4661: not primes
 PokeNinjaGuy#9592: meaning? sorry -- tired
 theChief#0001: ah, 8 years of professional experience 😂
 Lawn#1538: That’s actually amazing. Did they buy pizza in each different country?
 Cunnah#9270:  just aint youn either 😉
 LurkNautili#3246: 10 year old submitting pull requests sounds pretty hard core though
 Redline#7370: none of them are prime numbers that's for sure wait no
 SpawnCampGames#8155: at 36 i get called a boomer.. so i figured i was in the right
 Cunnah#9270:  38 ain't old
 nobodyuknow#4661: 8 and 9 were composite tho
 Lawn#1538: That’s not a boomer. They are a spring chicken.
 LurkNautili#3246: So you don't mean 17 years of professional working experience? That's what I was talking about 😃
 PokeNinjaGuy#9592: prime numbers 15? just a guess
 SpawnCampGames#8155: found the booomer! j/k ❤️  just means ur the most experienced
 Lawn#1538: I’m a bot.
 Cunnah#9270: 38
 LurkNautili#3246: Or maybe only in retrospect
 JuliusCube#8501: okay somewhat daily math challenge #whatever:
figure out what all these numbers have in common and find the odd one out:
2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,12,15,16,18,20,22,24,25,27,30
 SpawnCampGames#8155: 35 😦
 paulhdh#6428: 26 here
 theChief#0001: I'm only 27 
 LurkNautili#3246: Yes
 Lawn#1538: Yes.
 Cunnah#9270: the gentle tut and shake of head but continous "No no your doing fine....tsk"
 SpawnCampGames#8155: obfuscate that junk
 Geralt#4286: Is it possible to join a team even after the jam started ?
 PokeNinjaGuy#9592: LMAO
 Lawn#1538: Do want someone shaking their head at you and your code for two days.
 LurkNautili#3246: Perhaps even a graybeard lol
 Cunnah#9270:  one exception is if you have someone programming something completely seperate from the main code so like shaders for example
 LurkNautili#3246: Senior as opposed to medior i guess
 skejeton#5788: you got it
 SpawnCampGames#8155: got training wheels on compared to a jr dev
 Quentincroyable#5223: Are you supposed to read other's people code? I don't even have time to read mine while writing it
 PokeNinjaGuy#9592: makes you a boomer Sadge
 SpawnCampGames#8155: ur a beginner / learner
 Lawn#1538: The only reason you’d get another programmer would be to fill in gaps and have someone else to blame.
 LurkNautili#3246: Nah, it worked last year... But I'm always a bit nervous before these xD
 theChief#0001: damn it, what does that make me then  I'm on 16 or 17, I don't really remember lol
 JuliusCube#8501: oh i forgot about that, i dont think i did one yesterday either
 Jeker#3389: hell, i have like 4 years and i'd still consider myself intermidiete
 PokeNinjaGuy#9592: what about 6 years 😳
 Lawn#1538: That seems pretty normal. Are you concerned you’re lacking numbers?
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: am I seasoned after 5 years and 1 year at uni
 Zerofaction#0367: n stands for nerd
 SpawnCampGames#8155: i knew id get called on that 🤣 
 Redline#7370: daily math challenge when?
 LurkNautili#3246: Yeah I'm thinking 5+ years for seasoned
 skejeton#5788: not really merge conflicts but more like reading other people's code, usually gamejam code is write-only so it's additional overhead for all programmers, this applies to short term collaborations though, 2 days is too few to manage programmers, espeically when they are in different timezones
 JuliusCube#8501: the pattern here is unclear. it could be,
n : 
or it could be:
n : 
or something else entirely.
 Arfilish#8729: Not my way
 SpawnCampGames#8155: this math doesnt check out
 theChief#0001: 2.5 years isn't "seasoned" 😂 2.5 years is "not a beginner any more"
 SeanSS#0892: Github is my public enemy number one
 Cunnah#9270:  hearding cats comes to mind when it comes to programmers
 Vabenil#5485: You can always buy assets
 LurkNautili#3246: I'm the only one in our team of 5
 Redline#7370: I don't even know what you're talking about and I have been programming for about 2.5 years now
 SpawnCampGames#8155: lmao.. id say < half even use version control
 Arfilish#8729: I would like participate in team because graphics isn't something i can do good
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: I’ve been programming for so long and still feel like a novice
 LurkNautili#3246: I'm just curious because I've seen a lot of teams on teamfinder with like a whole ton of programmers and I was curious what people thought
 Lawn#1538: You have too much faith in people.
 theChief#0001: most of the people here are not seasoned programmers
 Redline#7370: why I don't participate in a jam with a team in a nutshell
 LurkNautili#3246: Any seasoned programmer can merge conflicts with ease, surely
 Triggered#6897: Simple math
 japson#4917: sounds like a bad tut tbh 😄 simple music have rules you can follow, usually what the rule says is the same thing people might " hear " instinctively
 LurkNautili#3246: Yeah I feel ya
 Arfilish#8729: doesn
 SpawnCampGames#8155: 1 programmer for 3, 2 programmers for 5, etc
 skejeton#5788: what one programmer does in one month, two programmers do in two
 Cunnah#9270:  good advice I have a potato linux machine but I use it for checking suspect files when helping fix stuff for ppl. Maybe I will invest in something else 🙂
 CodingLord#1012: ah ok
 Lawn#1538: Depends how many people there are in the team, at least one would be good.
 SpawnCampGames#8155: its the same as the project i think... the editor reflects what the build would show
 Merus#7019: I suggest a whole number of programmers, it's hard to get them to write code if they're in parts
 Jeker#3389: i got a nice 9 hours of sleep lol
 CodingLord#1012: isnt there a way to reduce graphics quality for the editor?
 LurkNautili#3246: What's a normal fraction of programmers per team?
 Jeker#3389: wooooo 4 hours for the jam
 Triggered#6897: Me trying to keep up with the chat
 JuliusCube#8501: *oh my god guys I know how you  can figure out the theme for the jam, heres how:*
wait for the theme to be announced.
 Lawn#1538:  use that man child money to buy a potato machine. For mixing and mastering, I own several sets of headphones and speakers of varying quality to ensure my songs sound great on any device. So, I try to treat game dev the same.
 SpawnCampGames#8155: it comes in practice.. u have to *train* your ear to hear subtle tones, notes, octaves etc
 theChief#0001: I already have my audio person, got them from team finder 😁
 Cunnah#9270:  I am trying to learn music but have hit on the problem when tuts say here you can hear this wants to go to this note or this note and I am just going ok. I feel like I am colour blind but for music
 SpawnCampGames#8155: ^ my friends tell me to change it when they see my screenclips of the editor loading up first... but i dont usually see a problem.. if my project gets slow i do what someone else alread mentioned and use different assemblies
 CodingLord#1012: thanks for help
 CodingLord#1012: i see
 Pixstatic#3464: it causes issues very very occasionally
 skejeton#5788: profilers are a thing you are looking for
 Pixstatic#3464: it still compiles code changes. scene changes do not need compiling
 SpawnCampGames#8155: lol no clue... ill have to look into it deeper... i wouldnt do anything before the jam tho,  that might mess up ur project
 Arfilish#8729: Thanks god i can make music myself, music school was useful
 Lawn#1538: This is a problem for me too, because my games don’t run on potatoes (mostly because they aren’t optimised and made in two days).
 japson#4917: well if you really want to there are emulators for lower end devices so you can test your game on bad hardware 😄
 Cunnah#9270:  yeah it is didn't mean it but yeah
 Pixstatic#3464: lmao
 CodingLord#1012: but if unity will not reload the scene then how will it compile anything new that I add?
 skejeton#5788: put a sleep call on frame kekw
 SpawnCampGames#8155: what engine are u using? i know for unity theres an asset that will reduce settings to emulate poor hardware
 Pixstatic#3464: I’ve got a dell gaming laptop and even *it’s* overkill
 LurkNautili#3246: Weird flex but okay 😜
 Pixstatic#3464: it’s what I spend the vast majority of my time doing and this is still relatable
 Lawn#1538: I just buy shaders, the effort to benefit ratio is skewed for me.
 Cunnah#9270: Anyone here have the problem that there machine is over powered for testing. Like I can get most things I make to run but then again I'm a 40 year old man child with to much disposable income so my machine is overkill for the indie scene.
 Quentincroyable#5223: Even to people who uses them sometimes lol
 SpawnCampGames#8155: ```cs
Turn on Project Settings -> Editor -> Enter Play Mode Options. When you turn it on Unity will not reload the Domain or the Scene, thus it will go to play mode at lightning-quick speed. But it does not go well with static scripts so beware of that```
 Pixstatic#3464: you would use a shader to do depth blending depending on circumstances
 Gurki#9176: True, but I'm also likely going to learn them next year in Uni, so I wanna get my feet wet before that
 Pixstatic#3464: honestly shaders are so useful but they’re very intimidating to people who haven’t used them before
 Gurki#9176: and overlaying it on top, but I really dislike that solution lol
 skejeton#5788: tbh this would work but sometimes performance decrease comes not because gpu can't keep up but because too much communication between gpu and cpu
 Gurki#9176: True, I've seen solutions for it, like rendering it in lower resolution using another camera
 Pixstatic#3464: I mean this problem is also solvable without shaders lol but I get your point
 Cunnah#9270: namespaces may be overkill for a game jam however
 Cunnah#9270:  you can set it to only compile changed namespaces
 CodingLord#1012: ill look into it too
 Gurki#9176: Still, I'd like to learn shaders so that I have that tool under my belt. Say I want to have only 1 specific object pixelated etc etc...
 Vabenil#5485: Does anyone here work on Linux? What do you do to compile your stuff for Windows?
 SpawnCampGames#8155: theres something u can do to make it where it doesn't re-compile evry time u enter play mode... ill have to look more into it
 Gurki#9176: lmao
 Pixstatic#3464: yup it’s like a hack for increasing fps and pretending it’s a stylistic choice
 skejeton#5788: well thankfully i'm just the programmer, the team guy is gonna manage other people
 Lawn#1538: Unity can’t run fast without the right gear.
 Pixstatic#3464: unfortunately the answer to this question half the time is “download an old version” because unity likes to be on the cutting edge and require ridiculous hardware
 Cunnah#9270:  I did a mapping jam for quake with a team who all bailed with an hour to go. It kinda burned me on the whole team thing. They were however the only guys to do it
 CodingLord#1012: I have no money
 Gurki#9176: Ah ok. I haven't thought of doing it that way. Would be more performant too right?
 Lawn#1538: Buy it some new track shoes.
 SpawnCampGames#8155: don't unless u got anti-anxiety drugs with u! 🤣  j/k
 japson#4917: ah got it, yeah I like the " known genre with a twist " type of ideas
 CodingLord#1012: How do I make Unity run faster its so slow 😭
 skejeton#5788: i've never done a game jam in teams over 2 people 😅
 Pixstatic#3464: yeah that’s just exactly what you do tho
 Lawn#1538: There are tools out there but I’ve had mixed success. In a stitch, Beautify has a post process filter.
 skejeton#5788: 6 people this time
 Pixstatic#3464: I’m using the bruteforce grass shader which seems pretty easy on performance, but I will include options to turn everything off as well
 Gurki#9176: If it's a 3D game, and I have 3D models? I feel like lower render resolution would make things blurry, unless I'd scale it up after with nearest neighbour somehow
 Triggered#6897: My game had same concept although the execution was horrible (it was my first jam)
 SpawnCampGames#8155: ive been debating on this for my main project... compute grass shaders are sooo nice tho 😢
 Cunnah#9270:  No you need that really bad aliasing for that true art house asthetic 😄
 Lawn#1538: A lot of those fancy grass shaders are often graphically expensive geometry shaders. Billboarding is the way to go if you’re not doing super zoomed out top down.
 Pixstatic#3464: just render at a low resolution… I’m not even sure you need a shader to do that
 SpawnCampGames#8155: ohhh no!!! atleast use TMP
 skejeton#5788: ui-less game
 japson#4917: anybody here doing the jam with a "huge" team ? like 10+?
 Cunnah#9270:  I'm going for the fresh default unity UI /jk
 Gurki#9176: Speaking of shaders, just started reading through The Book of Shaders. Need to learn how to make a pixelart shader because there's nothing I can find only for it. At least nothing that explains it in detail.
 Pixstatic#3464: and I have an option to turn it off because I’ve learned that some people use laptops that are decades old
 SpawnCampGames#8155: big brain move... i was suggesting this earlier.. the worst thing in the world is getting close to deadline going to build and nothing...
 Pixstatic#3464: I have tested everything in a webgl build already tho so it should be alright
 SpawnCampGames#8155: Everyone remember to make ur buttons have feedback <--- Protip
 CodingLord#1012: I use Trello for task management in Game Jams
 Pixstatic#3464: 👀 no idea if it is but I have a second shittier layered hull shader that I wrote myself that I know *for sure* uses passes instead of a geometry shader
 Cunnah#9270: Caviat to my last comment I can program and draw "good" is subjective on that front 😉
 Galactum#6235: paint 3d
 RedcoatsRevolt (Adam)#1185: there are dozens of us
 paulhdh#6428: yaaay
 SpawnCampGames#8155: tons of us are
 skejeton#5788: notepad ftw
 Galactum#6235: me
 Galactum#6235: oh this is cool I honestly just use milanote
 Cunnah#9270: Me, only thing I'm not good at is audio and music but I have a few go to websites 🙂
 BetaFruit#2804: yeah but like, more musicians then teams that need them
 RedcoatsRevolt (Adam)#1185: solo squaddd
 Spartiality#1145: Meeeee
 Lawn#1538: Here’s hoping it’s not a geometry shader.
 paulhdh#6428: anyone else doing this solo
 theChief#0001: there are usually a bunch of audio people, it's actually incredibly important for game feel and they can also join a bunch of different teams fairly easily!
 Quentincroyable#5223: Definitely
 Lawn#1538: I’m ashamed of myself.
 DrWorrell#7667: you see nothing
 Pixstatic#3464: I’m going with what I could only describe as “a short hike but I spent money on a fancy grass shader so by god I will use it!” style
 Cunnah#9270:  Syncopation is where the music plays notes just before the beat. the most famous gaming example is green hill zone in sonic 🙂
 BetaFruit#2804: is it just me noticing alot of musicians
 japson#4917: mouth music is the best
 Galactum#6235: the way i plan to approach it is with a mind map of sorts, as in when i see the theme i derive things like possible gameplay elements, etc. and then out of those come up with a game
 Quentincroyable#5223: Kinda asked for it, bare the consequences now
 DrWorrell#7667: i'm fine with whatever, can only do music/SFX so need a team to do anything
 infernoNoodles#8206: i know nothing about music so google time xd
 JQ2#4402: I'm doing a bit of that, I've got a framework built in Java and LibGDX
 BetaFruit#2804: i would(nt) if i could
 Teslobo#8274: Cue
 Lawn#1538: (***Cue the inevitable 4D ‘joke’ and hour long multi dimensional game discussion)
 SpawnCampGames#8155: nah its still 3d, just a 2d Illusion *waves hands around mysteriously*
 japson#4917: is it ? well nice concept ! and gg for the release 😄
 Cunnah#9270:   also you can use half beats and quater beats syncopation works with music as well 🙂
 Quentincroyable#5223: I mean if the game is basically the same but is fun and allows you to feel again the feeling of discovery, it would work
 notpenguin#8983: is anyone using their own custom engine for the game jam?
 BetaFruit#2804: to much work for me and my team
 theChief#0001: not if you use the 2D renderer xD
 Galactum#6235: not currently but in my next game jam i might
 SpawnCampGames#8155: im working with unity so technically anything i do will be *3d* ;D
 DrWorrell#7667: there is no escape
 Cunnah#9270:  the gun spins at a ratio so every so many bullets per beat
 caibi#5324: oof
 Galactum#6235: you just got noticed by like 4 people lol
 Lawn#1538: Who’s working with 3D?
 DrWorrell#7667: unfortunately, someone seemed to have noticed you
 BetaFruit#2804: the key is sending alot of messages and writing paragraphs of stuff
 Quentincroyable#5223: Hello
 infernoNoodles#8206: oh, thats a good idea to be honest
 Cunnah#9270:  then yeah it boils down to timing also you can employ cyotee time to the button press so even if you technically miss it still counts to give it the right feel
 Galactum#6235: question: how do you come up with ideas? is there any sort of process to it or does it just happen
 infernoNoodles#8206: but the bulets placements in the gun are random so its hard to alling it with music correctly
 Triggered#6897: Mine!?
 SpawnCampGames#8155: yea i think he meant no one needs a billionth cookie cutter side scroller
 japson#4917: sometime it's easier to take a well-known concept and add a twist to it, I believe one of the jam game was a 2D side scroller but where you can switch to a 3D version, I believe it led to toedee and topdee is the name of the game? 🙂
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: Yeah, but then the pitch changes. It's not a "amazing 2d platformer metroidvania" like Ori or Hollow Knight, but "a game about that gimmick that happened to be a 2d platformer"
 skejeton#5788: from my experience, when I tried to make jam games that require a lot of effort, usually something complex, it turned out to be not as fun. in hindsight try making simple mechanic with emergent behaviour, finding that can be hard. you can probably just start with something generic, then like john carmack, add one thing and see if it's fun, if it's not, then scrap it and try again
 Quentincroyable#5223: Devs are still making *and selling* some tho
 infernoNoodles#8206: i was thinking for example you have russian roulette with bullets and no bullets. Its a problem when the chamber is spinning and you want to hit empty ones but music insentivise you to press space unluckly in moment with the bullet.
 Zerofaction#0367: you understand me
 SpawnCampGames#8155: yea... just cuz a genre is overdone doesnt mean u shouldnt do it.. u just have to bring life back into it... be innovated, define a new subgenre
 JQ2#4402: In fact, thanks to some luck, I still have the original manuals! I'll screenshot one at some ponit
 Pixstatic#3464: no because everyone knows that as a unity developer with access to brackeys tutorials it’s possible to make any game because we’re built different than those stupid triple a studios /s
 Galactum#6235: i mean id be fine with one as long as it differs in some way from all the other ones
 Gurki#9176: Yep, at least the concepts. We switch to Processing when they get older
 Princent Vice#4280: Godot had been ported to PS Vita!
 Galactum#6235: but then again it is from ages ago so
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: I mean, nobody really needs a billionth 2d generic side-scroller platformer, right?
 Gurki#9176: Aye, worried as well
 SpawnCampGames#8155: i taught myself html back when my mother could pick up the phone and cut me off the internet 😉
 Cunnah#9270:  but don't worry too much as long as your music isn't massively overiding you can get away with it anyhow
 Teslobo#8274: Kids really do be learning coding from scratch
 Galactum#6235: to me, basic seems, rather ironically, pretty complex
 kcorb#6614: My 50v50 first person open world shooter is gonna be insane, hope PyGame can handle it
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: I know _how_ to make small games. I'm just struggling to come up with a concept that would work with such limitations.
 Gurki#9176: At work we teach as young as 7-8, starting with scratch
 Cunnah#9270:  I helped out on a project that had this problem. what they did is they had markers in the music to keep the beat (or just a timer that counted out the beat) they then just slightly delayed the QT to match the beat. It isn't too noticible as long as the beat is fairly quick
 Zerofaction#0367: That would be hard to do
 Quentincroyable#5223: It's never too late to cut of some work and reduce your scope but yes gamejam are a good exercice to measure what you can do
 SpawnCampGames#8155: start small, write everything down, then go back and trim, it doesnt take an extravagant idea to make a good game
 Arfilish#8729: I tried to do something with Unity when i was 6 years old, lol
 Pixstatic#3464: don’t forget it’s also going to have the robo dinosaurs from horizon zero dawn and the carjacking from gta
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: One extra hope I have is that I'm struggling to think of an idea that can be done in a reasonable time.
If I'll be able to make a decent jam game, it might be a good groundwork for a proper game.
 Gurki#9176: I'm 22, but that's the case for everything! There are really talented people out there, and it's wild to think they're often younger
 infernoNoodles#8206: or make it alling with the beat via some code magic
 Galactum#6235: True true
 SpawnCampGames#8155: Roblox
 JuliusCube#8501: there are lots of 13 year old game devs around here for some reason
 infernoNoodles#8206: ok but im asking about things like quick time events. What am i supposed to do if they happend and if for example you need to press spacebar in sertain time window that differ each time, like hit the window on a line with a moving marker
What would be your advice, lower down the music?
 Cunnah#9270:  I wonder who is the oldest here I'm 39 next month I am always surprised how much younger game devs I look up to are. (and I always think they are older than me 🙂 I think thats just wishful thinking!)
 Zerofaction#0367: im gonna make an action rpg with co-op multiplayer!!!!!!!!!!!
 SpawnCampGames#8155: if they are younger, the smarter ones will say they're not ;D
 Gurki#9176: children... *shudders the thought*
 Galactum#6235: yea thats understandable
 Pixstatic#3464: I am not thirteen but usually you see a few thirteen year olds around
 Gurki#9176: He means that there wont be others *younger* than you, but you'll find others that are your age or a bit older, and even older than that too
 SpawnCampGames#8155: 🤣  lol
 Galactum#6235: fair enough
 Quentincroyable#5223: Given the huge number of people I'd say you're definitely the only one
 DrWorrell#7667: yo welcome to whatever this is
 BrokenCalculator#2386: hello everybody
 Galactum#6235: i'm not younger than 13 though what?
 Arfilish#8729: I have read somewhere that Global Game Jam is only allowed for 18 years old, but if you're minor you have to be with parents
 Cunnah#9270:  generally people are influenced by external stimuli more than they think they are. You may find the game feel is off if it doesn't match the beat
 DrNukeLear#2414: If you’re younger than 13 moderators have to remove you from the server. Discord rules.
 Galactum#6235: ah yes delicious
 Galactum#6235: I hope i'm not the only young person i nthis game jam honestly cause I'm also 13
 infernoNoodles#8206: now i was thinking. How it is with reflex based games and game music?
Inst it misleading to have some beat might unwillingly guide you to press buttons when you should do it in precise moments?
 BetaFruit#2804: yummy
 Cunnah#9270:  I think that was where they first went my parents pre-date mainstream computers 🙂
 Zerofaction#0367: Im 42 and I scream all day
 Gurki#9176: watch this be the theme for this jam lmao
 Galactum#6235: soonish, it's in october
 DrWorrell#7667: is that coming up soon?
 japson#4917: ha good stuff ! Yeah I personally spend too much time making a video to have the channel grow haha
 Pixstatic#3464: I mean I’ve been doing game jams since I was 13 I’ve hardly heard of any of them gatekeeping based on age
 Galactum#6235: depending on how things go during this jam I might also participate in ludum dare 51
 BetaFruit#2804: puzzle with a hint of starwberry please
 DrWorrell#7667: what flavor? We have many genres
 Quentincroyable#5223: Please share some of your jam with us too
 Arfilish#8729: To be honest i would really like to participate in Global Game Jam in January, but i don't know if i'll be able (i'm only 16 and i'm in Ukraine, so i don't know if there will be GGJ at all)
 BetaFruit#2804: ohh could I have some game jam?
 Galactum#6235: that would actually be awesome
 Galactum#6235: i told my friends i was doing a game jam through a status update and like half of them asked "i want some jam too"
 SpawnCampGames#8155: pro-tip, set up ur project, pull in your dependencies, and run a test build before u even start
 DrWorrell#7667: now that would be cool
 Mattstov(Matt) ⃤#8596: Same exact response lmao
 Cunnah#9270: wow just realised that message makes me sound young 😛 like it
 Quentincroyable#5223: Great parents haha
 Pixstatic#3464: I’ll probably stream after the jam, having people play my game live is like the singular coolest feeling in the world so I wanna do that for some other people y’know?
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: They just don't have to deal with "project build failed..." during the jam because they've been there before.
 Cunnah#9270: I told my parents I am doing a game jam. they went on telling me to do my best and they are rooting for me. half an hour later they then asked "whats a game jam?"
 Gurki#9176: I'd reckon no, they likely sleep well
 SpawnCampGames#8155: once u start getting noticed tho its a snowball effect, i went from sitting at less than 100 for months, then like overnight its at 1.5k+
 Galactum#6235: tbh even when a stream is interesting i just leave it off in the background and do something else while listening
 MassedUp#8420: Do people who get top 10 suffer from insomnia, just a question
 Galactum#6235: true as well
 Pixstatic#3464: I’m the kind of person who tells myself I’m like you say you are and then is totally captivated by even the most boring live stream
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: Radio of the 2010s-2020s
 SpawnCampGames#8155: i done told my server im getting on top 10, they all laughed
 japson#4917: ha yeah true, the most struggle for small YTT channel is visibility so I get that
 lemmtopia#4415: Good morning!
 Cunnah#9270:  I always think watching someone else working on a project for a jam is risky as you get into that oh hell I'm copying someone (when you really aren't)
 Gurki#9176: Good kinda crazy, but crazy
 Galactum#6235: well i say "watching" but im the kind of person who lets streams run in the background and doesnt actually watch just listen
 Gurki#9176: That's for crazy people 🙂
 BetaFruit#2804: exactly...
 SpawnCampGames#8155: imagine instead getting on his top 10 video 😉
 DrWorrell#7667: and then you ste- "borrow" ideas
 Galactum#6235: if anyones livestreaming during the jam will likely be watching while working on my own game
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: While "leveraging GMTK name" was mostly a joke, it was _mostly_ a joke. If youtube will suggest your GMTKGJ video next to Mark's GMTKGJ videos, chances to get a click are _relatively_ high.
 Catfish#2063: ya just woke up
 Gurki#9176: yes, it also helps that no one is in the chat 😎
 Pixstatic#3464: game jams are so cool
 japson#4917: Also true 😅  it's like a niche videogame genre where the players just play every game they find even if the concept is the same 😄
 Gurki#9176: It's like fake motivation in a bottle, you watch it and then get hyped and then never do anything. Personally at least 😭
 SpawnCampGames#8155: exactly!! i dont watch em b/c of the "ohh, in 3 days, no way" aspect, but more for the "lets see how i stack up my 3 days vs their 3 days"
 DrWorrell#7667: well then perfect
 Gurki#9176: I've also streamed enough that I'm a pro at ignoring the chat 💯
 SpawnCampGames#8155: sorry chat, using u for my rubber duck 😄
 Cunnah#9270:  the real money is live procrastination on a project 🙂
 Pixstatic#3464: if most people in this server are like me they’ll happily binge videos of other people making gmtk jam entries
 Gurki#9176: Yup, I'd probably be saying things out loud though since it helps with debugging
 JQ2#4402: I've been livestreaming my game for a bit, and I'm not scared of being distracted by chat
 SpawnCampGames#8155: i was gonna say... stay focused... dont let chat distract u
 japson#4917: the YT concept of "doing a game in 3 days " has already been milked a bit much though, unless you come up with a real good idea 👀
 JQ2#4402: If yall do, please share the link somewhere, I'd love to pop in and say hi 😄
 Pixstatic#3464: I’m staying with my aunt to avoid the chaos of my regular household and I’m not gonna stream in someone else’s house lol… I wanted to tho
 Gurki#9176: But if I do I will likely barely speak in it LMAO
 Gurki#9176: Might livestream and record at the same time
 SpawnCampGames#8155: extra pressure
 theChief#0001: sometimes even higher 😂 25.7%, 30.6%, 33.9%, 28.9%, 26.0%
 Omegnight#7081: No it's less than half people who submit, we had 21k registered people last year and got ~5800 games
 JQ2#4402: Why not livestream?
 Gurki#9176: I'm gonna record it. Most definitely wont upload it. Too lazy/busy to edit it and publish
 Pixstatic#3464: I’m not sure I’ll make a devlog but I will record the process so maybe it’ll re-kickstart my youtube gamedev career
 SpawnCampGames#8155: save it for later.. double uploads
 Cunnah#9270: I am going to record my work unsure if I am going to setup a yt tho, I have a channel for my current project it might seem weird that the first entry isn't about the project... dunno
 SpawnCampGames#8155: yea seems about right
 Arfilish#8729: From my experience usually it's half of joined people submits games, but i have never participated in GMTK Jam so i could be mistaken
 Vabenil#5485: In my case I work on my own projects but I have never published anything, hopefully this will help me start getting things out there
 Pixstatic#3464: I’d conservatively place my bets on 4,500-5,000 seeing as there’s fewer people joined than last year
 theChief#0001: submissions for GMTK jams are historically 25-30% 🙂
 SpawnCampGames#8155: ohh so its a pretty standard known percentage already
 Redline#7370: I like to go with my 1/3 submits
 Gurki#9176: My wager is that it'll be around 6k-7k this timer around, likely closer to 6k
 BetaFruit#2804: i belive its a thing computer programs do
 MassedUp#8420: Submissions for 99.9% jams are around 20 to 25%
 Galactum#6235: LOL can you actually do that?
 DrWorrell#7667: sounds like a good idea
 Gurki#9176: Last year there were 5.7k
 japson#4917: alright we shall fall into your shameless plug and check you out haha 😄
 Cunnah#9270:  lol
 Redline#7370: I'd say 6000-7000
 BetaFruit#2804: half the people have the wrong link tho
 SpawnCampGames#8155: so i got a chance 😅
 theChief#0001: I'd be willing to put money on somewhere around 5,000 - 5,500 submissions lol
 Cunnah#9270:  I have released mods and map packs but no standalone games. I think I have the game design process kinda down but the whole asset wrangling still to get right
 japson#4917: based
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: To gain the experience of developing a standalone game from start to finish and players actually playing it.
_Totally not for ||trying to leverage the GMTK name to make the YT algo notice my channel once I make a devlog.||_
 SpawnCampGames#8155: 19.2k joined == ?? submissions i wonder
 BetaFruit#2804: your gonna hit the int limit and head into the negatives soon
 Galactum#6235: yep me too
 Vabenil#5485: I have never released a game, as long as I make something that works I will be satisfied
 Galactum#6235: it's at 11.8 million unread pings right now
 DrWorrell#7667: now that would be unfortunate
 BetaFruit#2804: good idea...
 Galactum#6235: i want to see how high the number can get
 SpawnCampGames#8155: wtf, why? lol
 Arfilish#8729: Imagine you pressing "Retry" and it just swaps the buttons
 DrWorrell#7667: yup, definitely failed immediately
 Galactum#6235: i am in a discord server that pings everyone hundreds of times per second
 Cunnah#9270: Myself I am doing it as a respite from a project I am currently considering porting over to godot. This will be in unity so may even be my unity swan song
 BetaFruit#2804: you fail to read all your notifications within 3 seconds
 DrWorrell#7667: heh
 Galactum#6235: lol
 Peter#0007: nobody tell them they're innocent and safe
 Galactum#6235: wait how do you lose the game?
 BetaFruit#2804: retry                           give up 😦
 Quentincroyable#5223: I'll assume I got a good ranking, anyone who disagrees will have to prove me wrong
 Gurki#9176: I'm currently working at my full time job from home. Taking some time to chill here lol
 Galactum#6235: like its kinda a diversion from working on other stuff but it's also a motivator to work on something
 SpawnCampGames#8155: im doing it as a diversion from main project.. and ive only ever done ludums so wanna give GMTK some love now 😉
 japson#4917: just for fun 😄
 Galactum#6235: technically both but also neither
 BetaFruit#2804: good question
 Cunnah#9270:  I just lost the game
 Gurki#9176: Ayayayay that sucks. Win10 has a nice feature where it almost always switches to my PS4 controllers speaker and mic input, and I have to manually disable it in audio settings 🙂
That and also it messing with my mic volume constantly.
 Quentincroyable#5223: I guess so, where is it saved tho?
 BetaFruit#2804: well... you lose then
 Cunnah#9270: I am curious who here is treating the game jam as an open mic night (AKA learn guitar in front of a live audience 🙂 ) and who here is doing this as a diversion from an on going project?
 Galactum#6235: yeah
 DrWorrell#7667: oh... oh dear
 BetaFruit#2804: yeah but you problbly got a new highscore
 Galactum#6235: I'm in 200 servers... oh no
 BetaFruit#2804: hey no cheats
 DrWorrell#7667: but then you don't get to read every message sent
 Quentincroyable#5223: Last time I played, an entire week passed by and I still did not win
Now it actually works when plugged in to the PC itself
 Gurki#9176: "mark as read" is a blessing, and a cheat to your game 😄
 Galactum#6235: pretty boring so far there's notifications only in one channel and that's this one
 Triggered#6897: Multi~~verse~~server
 BetaFruit#2804: ooh and you could even play across every server your in
 Arfilish#8729: It isn't that bad, but i don't see reasons for it to be twice heavier in terms of storage than 10
 Galactum#6235: im waiting for people to make more customization tools for windows 11 its pretty barren as of right now
 Hederlunden#3231: windows 11 is cringe, i will never update
 Galactum#6235: thank you :)
 Gurki#9176: are audio controls still behind 3+ clicks?
 Galactum#6235: this would not only be good practice but would serve as a skillset broadener
 theChief#0001: I prefer W11 - still hate windows, but at least 11 fixed my myriad sound issues and makes HDR actually sane
 Quentincroyable#5223: Be careful it's a time eating game
 Gurki#9176: good luck! It's a good motivator
 Arfilish#8729: I'm on Insider build which has returned taskbar drag & drop and Start menu folders
 Galactum#6235: because i learned C# and unity and stuff but havent put it to use yet
 Triggered#6897: Good luck!
 Galactum#6235: and actually you know, make something for once
 Gurki#9176: I don't want ads in my file explorer :))))
 SpawnCampGames#8155: ur a browser cookie away from a crash 😄
 BetaFruit#2804: I just came up with a game and you can play it almost anytime, click on every channel and scroll through to clear the notifications. Then, click any channels that get notifications. its like wack-a-mole and, it gets harder the closer it gets to the jam.
 Galactum#6235: i joined the game jam so that i would stop procrastinating
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Come on guys, it's not *that* bad
~~Immediately gets attacked from every direction~~
 Arfilish#8729: I have on;y 10gb of free space on C drive, what the hell
 Gurki#9176: stick figures and sketches will be my #intentionaldesign
 Lawn#1538: However, if your purpose of jamming is to learn something new then go ahead.
 Gurki#9176: I'm gonna be ded for the assets in my game xC
 SpawnCampGames#8155: ill stop u there.. and say *less worse* is u opinion >8)
 Gurki#9176: When win10 support dies I'm going Linux
 BadPiggy#5202: F
 Arfilish#8729: I already regret i updated to Windows 11
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: Like, I'm sticking to Unreal which I know ~~better~~ less worse than the rest, even if it means no in-browser play.
 Gurki#9176: I see where you're coming from, but generally I'd think that if you're used to one engine, another in the same language wont be much different to get used to.
Generally I'd agree though
 BadPiggy#5202: Game jams are more like tests of what you know rather than trying to learn something from scratch kek
 Lawn#1538: Agreed. It’s generally a bad idea.
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Just steal sound effects from scratch
 SpawnCampGames#8155: ^ same... maybe learning *that new tools exist* perhaps but i def wouldnt try to get involved with them
 Lawn#1538: Then find a musician!
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: I don't think learning new tools in a game jam is a productive idea.
 SpawnCampGames#8155: i dread doing audio.. and i know that audio will be a big deal if u want a decent game
 BadPiggy#5202: Noice
 Gurki#9176: Real, as in it's a game that is on itch and you can play it, looks *decent* and has a decent idea behind it, even if not brand new. It's also *very* simple
 Gurki#9176: yet 😄
 Redline#7370: nvm only took 4 minutes
 Quentincroyable#5223: But then you would not stay up 2 days straight and so would not need the power naps...
 Arfilish#8729: Worst thing there is that I have a broken sleep pattern so it's just hard for me to sleep 8 hours normally
 SpawnCampGames#8155: exit screen
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: It runs
 BadPiggy#5202: Define real
 theChief#0001: I'm glad it hasn't been an issue 🙂
 Gurki#9176: Well, good thing I use Godot then 😄
I will likely switch when it becomes a problem, but for small scale projects that I've worked on  it hasn't been an issue
 SpawnCampGames#8155: if u do stay up 2 days str8 try to get 2 hr pwer naps in here and there
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: There's a huge difference in productivity between 6 and 8 hours of sleep. A lot of people would _probably_ be more efficient in total if they'd sleep full 8 hours.
 asphyxxious#9561: alright maybe I won't stay awake for 48 hours straight 😔
thanks for the advice tho
 Arfilish#8729: It doesn't valid already. Now Unreal Engine supports in regular Rider, so you have to pay for subscription now. Or you can use EAP for free
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: 30ish good well rested hours are waaay more valuable than 48 sleep deprived ones
 SpawnCampGames#8155: this is true.. i dont recommend everyone try it.. but im not a stranger.. and as long as u get most of ur work done during the first day and half.. the 2nd day u can kinda finalize the easier bits while ur sleep deprived 🤣
 Gurki#9176: This is for *anything*. Not just gamejams. At least imo. Food, rest and you'll be better off with your ideas and motivation
 BadPiggy#5202: Scope small, keep your expectations in check, improvise if needed, focus on polish if you have time, leave some time for creating an itch page and exporting your game
And have fun
 MassedUp#8420: Dont scope creep, focus on polish, take breaks if u get stuck
 Gurki#9176: Yeah, pulling an allnighter is not the way to go. Sleep is absolutely necessary, even if it's just a nap
 japson#4917: yah
 Lawn#1538: And free for students!
 asphyxxious#9561: nah
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: There's also Rider for Unreal... Not sure how a C# IDE is a thing for a C++ language, gotta check it out.
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: General reminder that prior observation has shown that people who try to pull double all nighters often end up sputtering out
 SpawnCampGames#8155: keep ur idea smoll, submit
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Pro tip: Don't actually spend 48 hours working on your game
You will probably get better results when spending less time developing but more time taking care of yourself
 Gurki#9176: sleep
 asphyxxious#9561: this is my first game jam btw
any tips?
 SpawnCampGames#8155: same!!! i got 5 ppl in my channel doing the jam... all of em are pulling a no sleep run
 Gurki#9176: I've never used Rider, and if it costs money I don't plan to
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: I wouldn't trust anything subscription based.
 Redline#7370: god damnit I'll update windows brb in like 10 minutes
 Omegnight#7081: Haven't had the time to release any game in 2022 yet, I'm really happy about the jam, it will kickstart my motivation for the rest of the year
 Gurki#9176: Idk, VSC is free and easy to setup, and don't really need anything specific from any one editor. As long as it works the way I need it it's perfectly fine 🙂
 asphyxxious#9561: I will be awake for 48 hours straight
 Zorro#9743: yeah if you use Unity Rider is so so good
 theChief#0001: rider is _so_ good, well worth the subscription price
 SpawnCampGames#8155: i wish i had a sub to Rider... i use the trial everyonce in a while then i go back to VS and get kinda sick.. rofl
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Ah ok
 Zorro#9743: I still use Unity daily, but worth trying something new!
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Why'd you leave?
 SpawnCampGames#8155: why the grimace? unity is off the chain
 Gurki#9176: Yeap!
 japson#4917: yeah basically x)
 Arfilish#8729: Why VSCode? Nobody cancelled regular Visual Studio or JetBrains Rider
 Zorro#9743: I spent like ehh, 8 years in Unity 😬
 Gurki#9176: There's other alternatives for C# and Godot, but VSC is the easiest to setup, at least from what I've seen and tried! 😄
Personally I really like VSC and IntelliJ
 japson#4917: for sure
 SpawnCampGames#8155: wife: "are you listening to me at all?!"
you: "yes yes, *mind drifts to game ideas*
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Yeah and the other people can help brainstorm maybe
 JuliusCube#8501: i stay up later than I usually do during game jams but I still end up getting enough sleep
 japson#4917: that's perfect, you'll have time to think about what game you're gonna do ! 😄
 Gurki#9176: that's fine then 😄 don't need VSC for GDScript
 SpawnCampGames#8155: if youre coding with *anything* dont use VSCode : FTFY 😄
 Triggered#6897: I too have my exams right after jam ends, are goin on already
 Gurki#9176: I've got to go for dinner an hour right after it starts lol
 BurnV06#5857: Oh I thought you were talking about the Geometry Dash level when you said VSC
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: I just use GDscript
 japson#4917: for first timers, get good sleep everyday ! people tend to force it till the morning then can't get any good work done out of being tired 😄
 Gurki#9176: If you're coding with Godot, and don't use VSCode, prepare for pain, at least for C#.
Godot doesn't have intellisense or any autocomplete for c# in the godot editor yet
 CodingLord#1012: Actually the main problem is I have to go to school
 BurnV06#5857: Second game jam for me (first was GMTK 2021)
 CodingLord#1012: well I neither a pro gamer nor a pro game dev
 SpawnCampGames#8155: if(obvious){return;}
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Previous engine was GMS2, but I've tried almost all of them lol
 JuliusCube#8501: yeah, just make something that runs on a potato battery
for example a superintelligent AI that used to run a science facility that did experiments on people who were wielding a gun that shoots holes.
 Triggered#6897: !godot
 SpawnCampGames#8155: what did u two come from if first time with godot  
 Lawn#1538: gamer != game dev
 Gurki#9176: VSC is a must for you. Otherwise you will smack your head off the desk more than necessary
 Snickerzilla#4948: First game jam for me too and I do not know what to expect xd
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Same
 Gurki#9176: It'll be fun for Zorro 😄
 CodingLord#1012: No worries I am a pro gamer, the exam is too easy for me
 SpawnCampGames#8155: well good luck u 2, esp u with the first time godot usage 😬 lol
 Gurki#9176: First jam for me
 Zorro#9743: No, but first time using godot.
 Triggered#6897: Use this few hours to prepare for exam
 Lawn#1538: So like, are potatoes Turing complete?
 Gurki#9176: same here. I'm not planning on being on the board, might not even have time to submit a playable game, but I want to push myself and try learn as much as I can today and tomorrow.
 BadPiggy#5202: In terms of buyer experience anyway kek lol
 Lawn#1538: I guess so. You can make batteries with them
 SpawnCampGames#8155: first jam?  if so.. just aim to submit.. good first goal
 BadPiggy#5202: Oh damn. That's actually cool
 Triggered#6897: Is it possible to do calculations on actual potatoes?
 Lawn#1538: Only you can tell us the answer to that one bud.
 JuliusCube#8501: steam > epic in every way
 Zorro#9743: yeah no I'm most likely not gonna make a masterpiece of a game. Most likely just make a tiny godot game and be happy I learned some things
 Redline#7370: another cool thing with epic is that they have a C# SDK too for some reason, so I can make EPIC multiplayer unity games and it doesn't cost me anything unlike steam
 BadPiggy#5202: ( I mean literal potatoes btw. Not poor computers )
 japson#4917: can you make potatoes out of games though
 Gurki#9176: Not *very* good with it yet, so I'm using this jam to get better with it 🙂
 CodingLord#1012: I have exams in two days how will I do the jam
 BadPiggy#5202: If you can run DOOM using potatoes, then you can make games using potatoes
 Gurki#9176: It's what I'm personally using myself
 japson#4917: yeah nowadays people make skyrim on microwaves so I'm not surprised anymore haha
 Gurki#9176: but if you venture into C# Godot, it's worth it. Just be prepared to need the community for some quirks of the C# implementation
 SpawnCampGames#8155: *looks at watch*, better hurry mate
 JuliusCube#8501: we have so many that the number of powerpoint devs overflowed from 4,294,967,295 to -1
 BadPiggy#5202: Cool
 Zorro#9743: Ok maybe I'll quickly try out both before the jam. I'm a big C# user but open to using something else
 Redline#7370: no it's with any engine
 BadPiggy#5202: Epic technically takes a lesser cut, though idk if it's only if you use unreal
 Gurki#9176: more documented atm, cleaner overall code, less finicky interactions that are still being patched
 Lawn#1538: Open Source.
 MassedUp#8420: Ive seen games on MS Excel
 Triggered#6897: In engine editor. Less hasle to run gdscriot the  c#
 SpawnCampGames#8155: im weary of any engine specific languages for some unrational reason
 Redline#7370: Epic Games vs Steam for publishing games? Fight with your opinions!
 japson#4917: A power point game is something I'd like to see now thx
 MassedUp#8420: Its like python, easy but u gotta learn
 Zorro#9743: I'm WAAY more comfortable in C#, but are there big benefits to GDScript for godot?
 japson#4917: cool ! the yt grind is real then
 japson#4917: ha,* if the jam goes well enough *
 JuliusCube#8501: its your choice, if you feel more comfortable with gdscript then go with it.
 Tomthefish#6960: give gdscript a try, its pretty great
 Redline#7370: We have at least -1 powerpoint game devs
 Triggered#6897: I would recommend gdscript
 SpawnCampGames#8155: i work for a company that does kiosks, im a UI/UX developer.. but i make YT unity tutorials, and tutor ppl but *not technically* , just aspiring
 MassedUp#8420: We have 0.25 Fortran devs
 Zorro#9743: I'm thinking of maybe trying godot for the first time. Done a lot of Unity work. Is it worth trying to do godot with C# or should I give GDScript a try?
 JuliusCube#8501: "at least four"
are you missing the word "hundred" or maybe even "thousand" after the word four or are there only 4?
 Coffe#5594: do we have any C devs
 Redline#7370: *not yet*
 SpawnCampGames#8155: poor souls
 japson#4917: unity for me, anyone from the game industry here btw? 😄
 BadPiggy#5202: But anyway yeah
I'ma use Unity as well
2.5D ftw
 Zutilt10 | Jonathan. W#0339: I've heard of people that used Construct
 MassedUp#8420: Do we have any C++ devs
 SpawnCampGames#8155: lmao
 BadPiggy#5202: You saying we ain't real Devs ? 👀
Jk
 Lawn#1538: ~~There are at least four UE devs by my count.~~ there’s quite a few around here
 SpawnCampGames#8155: unity ftw! 🙂
 Redline#7370: I'm a fellow christian unity gamer
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: you can just post the web address and it'll show up as a link
 SpawnCampGames#8155: we got any unreal devs here?
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: or mainline some godot tutorials like me
 SpawnCampGames#8155: markup -> regular HTML link with the external link
 Eyesbesore#7355: whats the best way to link an external webpage to the itch.io page ?
 SpawnCampGames#8155: example: mine may be a whimsicle bright game.. or maybe a grungy dark game... no clue, but i can fix colors and artwork later
 SpawnCampGames#8155: i'd set up the basics leave the theming until after the jam unless u know what kinda game ur making..
 JuliusCube#8501: dont give me "this scratch cat will win the entire brackeys game jam" flashbacks
 Ahnaf30e#3408: I think i made the auto build and upload thingy work work!!!!
 japson#4917: look up on how to setup an itch page, having it well-setup can attract more players as well 🙂
 Zutilt10 | Jonathan. W#0339: Use Python
 SpawnCampGames#8155: imma use scratch 😈
 Arfilish#8729: I think it will be mistake if i'll try to use Unreal Engine C++ in this jam, but i think i have to try
 JuliusCube#8501: you need an itch
 Redline#7370: not the exe file, the entire folder as a .zip file
 SpawnCampGames#8155: i think u need an itch yes
 Zutilt10 | Jonathan. W#0339: How do submissions for the jam work? Do I need to set up an Itch.io page for the game or do I just send in an exe file?
 BadPiggy#5202: Aye, it will most probably be the same, sans one dimension in vector math
 SpawnCampGames#8155: ^  best way to kill ur submission
 BadPiggy#5202: This is actually important though lol
 Turquoise#2894: hmm....can i learn how to program in 2D from previously only doing 3D in 5 hours?
 MassedUp#8420: And put a timer for every 30 mins reminding "NO SCOPE CREEP"
 BadPiggy#5202: Hell, I'ma watch some GDC talks since I'm done with work now lol
 Turquoise#2894: ideal usage of time
 SpawnCampGames#8155: on top tab change to Unity Registry
 Redline#7370: package manager + ˇˇ
 MassedUp#8420: Yes
 ◈・ Altaꐟ#9999: how can i find probuilder for unity
 BadPiggy#5202: Watch GMTK videos in the mean time
 japson#4917: Hey everyone ! hope y'all ready for the jam 😄
 BadPiggy#5202: ***No***
 Arfilish#8729: Jam will start in 5 hours. Interesting, will i make some game base in time?
 SpawnCampGames#8155: i got you ;), obs been set up like that since about 3 months after starting to learn unity... with all the questions i had to ask around the web, i needed a hotkey almost immediately 😄 rofl
 MassedUp#8420: And update ur software before the jam starts
 MassedUp#8420: You will need it, throughout your journey
 MassedUp#8420: Good luck
 Turquoise#2894: hey all! first time joining a game jam :)
 SpawnCampGames#8155: musta been lots of static screen, the compression did its job 🙂
 MassedUp#8420: I also recommend hooking up some keyboard button to record and stop for things while developing
 Redline#7370: I'm doing 1080p 60fps with 2 audio lines with pretty high bitrate, so I'm definetly going overkill
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: ready for her closeup
 Arfilish#8729: Hello guys
 SpawnCampGames#8155: thats my workflow too! much smarter that way imho
 Redline#7370: instead of a "how it was made" video
 MassedUp#8420: I dunno how but one of my 4 hour recording was under 2 gb and didn't have that bad quality either
 Redline#7370: I'm just not gonna record, and make a video about the interesting things afterwards
 SpawnCampGames#8155:  this just hits differently :D,  you too mate
 Beardules#6108: Best of luck everyone!
 Redline#7370: *me after seeing the 250gb of video files after a 3 day jam*
 SpawnCampGames#8155: yes true.. i remember during ludum Twitch was full of streamers playing games.. just had to sign up and wait ur turn
 MassedUp#8420: Even if the games not that good if ya can bond with the dev it feels better
 MassedUp#8420: Devlogs can be a good way to have people play your game
 SpawnCampGames#8155: I find em always interesting to watch... but as a YT'r i understand the work that goes into editing afterwards, lots of ppl get burn out during the jam and just hold the footage lol
 MassedUp#8420: Might try
 SpawnCampGames#8155: Southern USA
 Veqsa#8120: Are you dutch?
 Lawn#1538: You can advertise your YT when the appropriate channel opens.
 Redline#7370: oh yeah I need to put that in the rules
 SpawnCampGames#8155: i got u.. 🙂 *spy infiltrates stream to steal ideas*
 SpawnCampGames#8155: we pluggin channels.. check out me on YT too 😉 😈
 BadPiggy#5202: A mod being muted ?!?
Heresy
 SpawnCampGames#8155: anyone recording for devlogs? i tried during ludum dare 47 but just too much footage to sift thru so i kinda let it just sizzle out
 Lawn#1538: I’m muting myself for being defeated.
 Lawn#1538: I walked into that one.
 MassedUp#8420: No not the timeout, they give me vietnam flashbacks
 BadPiggy#5202: Stole my joke
 Redline#7370: *You know the rulees and so do iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii (sry)*
 MassedUp#8420: I actually thought the theme would be announced earlier cuz i dumb and didn't read the PM next to the time
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yeah you don't need to register a team and only the person who uploads the game needs to join the jam page officially
 Icosaplex#8263: Great thanks
 SpawnCampGames#8155: *No Input*
 Redline#7370: yep
 BadPiggy#5202: The next theme is combine genres
 Veqsa#8120: i remember u saying the theme sucked or smth
 SpawnCampGames#8155: then u can add attributors 
 Veqsa#8120: 👋
 Redline#7370: I love how people remember me but I don't remember anyone
 MassedUp#8420: Its usually a limit to the players controls or the player itself
 SpawnCampGames#8155: just 1 person with itch needs to apply
 Redline#7370: brackeys
 JuliusCube#8501: brackeys
 Veqsa#8120: Where do i know u from?
~~did u participate in my "quick jam"?~~
or brackeys?
 MassedUp#8420: I see a pattern
 Icosaplex#8263: In terms of registering teams... Do we need to pre-register our team or just list team members at time of submission?
 BadPiggy#5202: ( oinks in welcomeness )
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: ty
 JuliusCube#8501: redline are redline and redline your pronouns or something
 SpawnCampGames#8155: me after the first 12 hrs ^
 Redline#7370: the trend is at least 2 words
 BadPiggy#5202: *Only one
 SpawnCampGames#8155: there is.. its *non-standard* ;D
 MassedUp#8420: There must be a trend
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Previous themes:
Dual Purpose Design
[genre] without [mechanic]
Only One
Out of Control
Joined Together
 Veqsa#8120: Thanks
 SpawnCampGames#8155: beneath each section is the theme
 Lyfe#8258: I pledge to add microtransactions and skinner boxes to my jam game
 Cheese#8160: Last year was Joined Together. Year before was Mechanic but not Genre or something like that
 Veqsa#8120: What are the older themes?
 SpawnCampGames#8155: MMORPG souls-like 😉
 Pyth0n#0572: I feel like ive just finished studying for a test and i can finally relax but i cant cause im worrying wether ive done enough
 Teslobo#8274: Sorry to hear but I hope the trip is good
 Ollieboy#2670: Oh definitely, I am definitely not going anywhere near something gratuitous or upsetting
 Diatere#5783: Sadly I think I'm not going to be able to do this game jam, it's just slightly too tight with my trip to Canada I think. Hopefully next year
 Teslobo#8274: Just keep the spirit of the rules in mind and you'll be fine
 yen#7950: 😋
 Ollieboy#2670: But it makes sense that we can't ASK "if" something is acceptable
 Ollieboy#2670: I was thinking this was about the discretion to disqualify
 Lascif#0184: It's implying they can't check everybodys stuff because of time restraints
 Ollieboy#2670: Right, yes that makes more sense
 Teslobo#8274: Like if we needed to make a judgement call on every outlier we would be here all day
 Teslobo#8274: I'm pretty sure that's correct
 Ollieboy#2670: Unless that is and incorrect interpretation
 Ollieboy#2670: Hey mods, it would appear that there seems to be a typo in the rules:
`As always, Mark and the mods can't decide, on a case by case basis, what is and isn't acceptable so please use your best judgement!` - guessing this should be "Mark and the mods `CAN` decide"
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: just realized that you're Dotwo from Adam's End Of Video Credits lmao
 Nikyy#5562: supppp lads how's everyone doooiin
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: Really the lowest level possible, but anything more than that ramps up _so_ quickly
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: If anyone is going for _remote_ multiplayer, I highly recommend limiting yourself to something turn-based with websockets
 Lascif#0184: Simple score boards and stuff like that kind of "multiplayer" is super easy but people really want to be doing decent netcode in gamejams must like the pain.
 SeanSS#0892: Thats true there are a surprising amount of tutorials out there lol
 Cheese#8160: You could probably make a decent minecraft clone in a weekend tbf
 SeanSS#0892: Dear God
 Lascif#0184: The thing I see a lot for gamejams is people wanting to do multiplayer yet have never done it before
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Cat Cam is live if any patrons are around
 awsumturtle#2957: this time I feel like coding an AAA level engine from scratch and making a really complex mmorpg with it
 SeanSS#0892: This time Im going to make all of minecraft
 Lascif#0184: Love keeping it simple with a gamejam and then having stretch goals for a wider scope. That's how we did it last year.
 Redline#7370: trying not to overscope again
 Cheese#8160: I will build a MMORPG with twelve wikipedia's worth of in-game lore
 Lascif#0184: Wonder how big everybody is going to make their scope for the game. That's what I always find fun
 MCCV#1542: 🪨
 Cheese#8160: 🧀
 redve#6507:  did you find something with playing mp3 instead wav?
 SeanSS#0892: Fight fight fight fight
 Redline#7370: yes
 awsumturtle#2957: so you weld an i4 to a v8? quite the big engine block lol
 cheesepizza#3335: identity theft is not a joke
 cheesepizza#3335: this place is not enough for both of us together
 awsumturtle#2957: understandable
 Redline#7370: look at my status
 Cheese#8160: Sorry I am the better cheese
 MCCV#1542: Twin turbo naturally aspirated Unity engine
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: the others are welded to the engine but aren't connected to anything
 cheesepizza#3335: another cheese ?
 Redline#7370: he uses a seperate I4 to reach the 12 cylinders
 MCCV#1542: XD
 Cheese#8160: Its possible because I don't know anything about car engines lmao
 awsumturtle#2957: Wait v8 and 12 cylinders? how is that possible?!
 awsumturtle#2957: Ah 😆
 Redline#7370: nah that's too much effort for me
 Lascif#0184: You can also license the song yourself using epidemic sound if you really wanted to use it
 SeanSS#0892: On YT doe Ive heard people can get soft banned from it so be careful
 R2D2Vader#0693: especially if you delete the vod after the stream- oh youtube LOL
 Redline#7370: I'm streaming on youtube : D
 SeanSS#0892: I think if youre streaming on twitch it wont matter as much with copyrighted music since from my experience they just mute the vod when they detect it
 Lascif#0184: My Unity does use forced induction (Has fans blowing the CPU and GPU afterall)
 Redline#7370: ah ok I'll make sure to mute the stream and use subtitles then, thx!
 Mark Brown#6982: It is allowed by me - but it does use licensed music, yes (from Epidemic Sound)
 awsumturtle#2957: twin turbo
 SeanSS#0892: As for me Im gonna be asleep when the theme is revealed so I'll have to look forward to it the next day
 SeanSS#0892: I think people have done it before so I think you gucci
 Redline#7370: Oh I never aksed, is streaming the theme reveal premier video thing allowed? If so does it contain any form of copyrighted music that I'd have to worry about?
 SeanSS#0892: True
 Tapu#9161: The car would crash
 Lascif#0184: I can actually run my last gamejam game in my car as it has an Android tablet for a radio 😂
 Cheese#8160: Unity V8 2 litre 12 cylinder
 SeanSS#0892: I wish I can use unity to run my car
 Lawn#1538: Pretty certain they also need to hit “join jam” on itch if they want to be credited appropriately.
 Lascif#0184: Car engine or game engine? 😅  jk using unity
 ccsrgamer01#2711: Ok thank you two!
 Lawn#1538: Only one jammer needs to submit the game, they can then credit the other authors if they also use itch.
 kcorb#6614: My team of 3 this year are gonna kill it I'm sure (Me, Myself and I)
 Cheese#8160: What engine you working with?
 SeanSS#0892: Only one itch account is needed afaik
 R2D2Vader#0693: haha car dev#
 ccsrgamer01#2711: Hey newcomer here!
I got a team of three
Does all the member need to  register the jam itch.io or only one is enough?
 Lawn#1538: As long as they aren’t NSFW and if you need to credit their use, then credit appropriately.
 Infiniverse#9886: jam starting in few hrs!
 SeanSS#0892: Gotcha gotcha
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: So long as you're not deliberately making stuff beforehand specifically for use in the jam you're good
 Lawn#1538: You can use any assets you’re legally entitled to use.
 SeanSS#0892: Just to clarify are you allowed to reuse old assets?
 SeanSS#0892: Ye
 Lawn#1538: Given that this is a jam about *game design*, pre-making your entire game is probably a waste of time and will box you into a certain idea.
 dardasaba#9759: I'll have to miss the first 12ish hours of the jam, sad :(
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: yep, "if you have to ask" and all that
 Lawn#1538: As a general rule, if you feel like it would be breaking the rules, then it probably *is* breaking the rules.
 SeanSS#0892: I think you could reuse old code and assets if you want
 Lawn#1538: The rules are pretty loose.
 Lascif#0184: I mean using something like Rewired wouldn't consider rule breaking would it?
But if you have an existing menu system for key binding that would be against the rules?
 kcorb#6614: Doesn't really make sense to either since the theme could be some unique control mechanic
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: np!
 L3mmy♡#2307: So no coding that ahead of time then- Thanks for answering Fearal
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: whilst we can't rule explicitly, the general rule of thumb is that if you're specifically writing code that you know will be in your jam entry, that's breaking the rules
 L3mmy♡#2307: I have an AZERT and not a QWERTY keyboard so your WASD is not the same for me on my keyboard
 L3mmy♡#2307: Yeah
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Do you mean doing it beforehand?
 L3mmy♡#2307: I personally wouldn't think so
 L3mmy♡#2307: Is making code to have configurable controls considered as taking an advantage for the game jam ?
 darlingS#1797: Question away
 L3mmy♡#2307: I have a question
 Lawn#1538: Yeah I’d avoid that if you want your game to actually be playable.
 pixal#1121: Like  learning how to use new unity input system in every gamejam, but not actually using it
 Lawn#1538: This is the way.
 JuliusCube#8501: yes and i cant sleep during the day since theres no thunderstorm
 IamHaPPy#2536: In my defense I have just woken up when I told them that
 Lawn#1538: Use the tools and tech you’re already comfortable with using, unless the goal of your jam is to learn something new then I’d avoid features you aren’t so confident in integrating.
 R2D2Vader#0693: KEKW
 Lawn#1538: You’ve lead them astray twice.
 Lawn#1538: Appropriate response from them.
 IamHaPPy#2536: i thought yesterday was the day and i told my jam partners, today is jam day and they were like what did you smoke
 Phallo#3476: depends on the game... but if you know how to use cinemachine and it makes sense for the game... cinemachine is really useful
 Redline#7370: ah yes finally gamejam day ^^ yes
 GodOfPro#7302: do you guys think i should use cinemachine for the camera or just the regular camera in the jam
 Phallo#3476: I slept for 5 hours... but im gonna go for another 4ish in a bit
 yugioh#7402: I slept 12 days
 IamHaPPy#2536: minutes
 IamHaPPy#2536: i slept 7
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: 11 hours of sleep is above the limit for me of too much... 9 is amazing, then at ten it starts to be not so great
 pixal#1121: The devil inside, isn't letting him sleep
 yugioh#7402: Oh i slept for 12 hours
 IamHaPPy#2536: you can't sleep anymore? are there monsters nearby?
 JuliusCube#8501: i just woke up from an 11 hour sleep, im unable to sleep more.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: fresh mind ready to start a project
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: that's what I'm planning on doing lol
 pixal#1121: Naah actually gonna sleep after it starts
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: just sleep till the jam starts lol
 JuliusCube#8501: today is jam day
theres less than 8 hours before it starts
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: yo
 K'miinik#3171: oh nice
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: the same stuff is also pinned in here
 K'miinik#3171: also check the pins in 
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: always check the licence of any assets you use and make a READ-ME file to go in your game zip that has the information you legally need to include in it
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: just be aware of crediting requirements
 infernoNoodles#8206: I would give you an emote but i cant for some reason
 Lascif#0184: Itch.Io itself can be great for free assets with different kinds of licenses
 infernoNoodles#8206: Any sites for free legal assets?
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: I cannot believe you didn't annotate each of Boot's bootses
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: there are three cats in this picture
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: catcam is live now
 MrBen#0001: yep
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: The itch.io servers are already getting slower
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: this is boots!
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: i'd be doing catcam rn if it wasn't drizzly. actually might be ok now
 Lawn#1538: Is cat cam returning this year?
 awsumturtle#2957: He wants to make a game as well 😆
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: he typed out a full page worth of e's but fortunately failed to send it
 Cletus2000#0709: Cat?
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: '#[/###
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: excellent
 terrysaw#9401: That's the plan!
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: lol gte yourself all set up then take a rest
 terrysaw#9401: I am more excited than I realized. I woke up multiple times early this morning to the same dream where the theme is announced and I immediately came up with the best idea and need to get working on it lol
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: theme suggestions and countdowns in 
 Bart Moon#2749: Of course.
 Pixstatic#3464: yep so the same as previous years then
 Cletus2000#0709: QA in 48h jam?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yeah for playtesting you just have to find people to playtest
 Bart Moon#2749: Worst case scenario, post "DM me if you want to playtest my game" in general chat
 Bart Moon#2749: I think the question is about something like "game-jam-playtesting"
 Pixstatic#3464: so not exactly what I was hoping for
 Pixstatic#3464: that specifically says "no direct links to games"
 cheesepizza#3335: Read
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: theres a  channel
 Henry_Hamster#4240: fair enough
 Pixstatic#3464: yeah just wanted clarification
 Henry_Hamster#4240: "This channel is for posting game review requests, and will open up when the game jam begins! Keep in mind that it has a very long timer!
"
Note: "when the game jam begins!"
 Pixstatic#3464: does  open at the start of the jam or only during review period? it would be good to get some people to give feedback mid-jam
 Cletus2000#0709: Known issues?? Nah, key features
 Lascif#0184: Yeah having a known issues section is probably good so people are aware that you know what bugs there are. Think I might have that this time
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: its a jam game, people will expect bugs. Remember to put a "known issues" section in your itch page text so that 1. people know there's a problem and 2. you don't get the same message telling you about it over and over again
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: One thing Ive noticed is that the superteams who join and make some AAA thing in 3 days sort of skew perception of how much of a mess a 3 day game jam game is allowed to be
 PatateNouille#5627: ah :( there might be additional checkboxes to uncheck somewhere in the settings, wouldn't be surprising with unreal, but I wouldn't know if that's the case
 K'miinik#3171: i need to get a cord for my second monitor
 pixal#1121: They aren't bugs, they are features
 Bart Moon#2749: I'll see in engine in a moment, but I remember disabling it in the project last year, and people would still have the pop up :/
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: exciting
 Lascif#0184: This'll be my first gamejam since getting two 4k screens so hopefully that extra screen real estate will help
 PatateNouille#5627: if you're talking about unreal games or even the engine, there's a SteamVR plugin enabled by default, it's the culprit, disabling it should fix steamVR opening up in both the editor and the build, but has to be done on every project, and usually people that don't own a VR headset don't know about it so they leave it enabled because it doesn't bother them
 caibi#5324: let make some eggy models in Blender: 100% GPU USAGE
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I just added it to the resources list pinned post as well
 Trianull#5928: with enough experience you can make some pretty cool things pretty quickly with pico-8, and there's *zero* build time, so you can also rapidfire experiment/debug
oh yeah and it also can play right in the browser, and even handles controller support for you
 pixal#1121: Yeah, relaxing till the very last moment
 Lascif#0184: Having a fixed pixel size screen is nice because then it's all about scaling up
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: That too
 Lascif#0184: Taking a relaxed approach to a gamejam is better. I found also having a stocked fridge/pantry and plenty of water helped too 😅
 Trianull#5928: not to mention 128x128 screen size
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: Main limit of Pico-8 are the default limitations to number of characters in your code, color palette etc
 theChief#0001:
 theChief#0001: already been linked a bunch of times mark smh, you're behind the curve 😉
 Bart Moon#2749: I do, Steam VR just screams that my VR hedset is not plugged whenever I open anything :d
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: Lua based so easy to pick up. It's an integrated thing which can do programming/ sprites/maps/sounds/music all by itself however my actual programmer friends hate coding in it so they write in something else and ctrl+v it over.
 Lascif#0184: Last gamejam it was literally just an hour or two of panic of hoping something would build in time and work (whilst I was at work) to upload before the timer ran out 😂
That was for theChiefs gamejam a while ago
 kcorb#6614: Do you not unplug your headset when you are not using it ?
 Bart Moon#2749: I've disabled every single thing that had something to do with VR, and still people would have Steam VR pop-ups.
Now I also own a VR hedset, and to be honest... no idea, this sh... is just trying to turn on no matter what you start on your PC.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: for sure, this is exactly why we say get all your project prepped and get your itch page out the way etc because that time just gets chewed up
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I've never tried pico-8 but I have it on my laptop, is it any good?
 Omegnight#7081: Yeah, I remember the VR settings on a few games
 Lascif#0184: I swear gamejams take longer to do simple things rather than when I'm doign relaxed gamedev
 Lizard Of Oz#6916: I'd also recommend to learn in advance how to make an optimal build. Unreal's default project settings are terrible for a gamejam game.
 Pixstatic#3464: 4 hours goes by quickly in this economy
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yeah you want to get in before the rush and also have time to check all your builds work properly and hive time to rebuilda nd export them if there are issues etc
 pixal#1121: Exactly
 K'miinik#3171: it's a fun gamble
 Pixstatic#3464: that's the whole industry wdym
 M_Raven#4076: Masochism in gamedev
 Pixstatic#3464: unity is supposed to do that too but y'know
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: I get around export issues by using pico-8 which does all that for me 👍
 pixal#1121: I guess some people are addicted to last hour build fails.
 Henry_Hamster#4240: 4 hours 😮
 M_Raven#4076: Reasonable bedtime? Hah! *It’s 5:30 in the morning where I am 😭*
 Lascif#0184: Yeah, that's definitely worth doing. Also testing to see how it performs in web too to see if you have any problems with performance or borders
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: we always recommend uploading to itch at least a couple of times a day and then give yourself 4 hours to do your final build and export
 Pixstatic#3464: forgetting that webgl sucks is a big one (it does)
 Lascif#0184: People exporting in the wrong size, in the wrong format, not testing it prior to submitting and more
 Pixstatic#3464: I've just spent a few days fixing unity issues and running FPS tests with roughly the same graphics the final game will have (-actual assets, it's just shaders on cubes lol)
 ThatIsANoNoWord#5311: I know the pain of exporting, which is why I generally try to finish a couple hours early for exporting
 M_Raven#4076: THIS, absolutely this
 Lascif#0184: I feel like every game jam you see panic right at the end when it comes to exporting and uploading to itch.io
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: don't worry it only needs time and I'm not a begginer anymore
 Bart Moon#2749: Yeaah, true. Export some projects as a practice. Maybe even get some example projects that have a lot of stuff improted, to see how much it will take.
 ThatIsANoNoWord#5311: heyo
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: gmtk videos are so good
 Pixstatic#3464: get the basic things you'll need imported and working so you can focus on *just* making the game during the allotted time
get your software ready and updated
create your itch page and blank project
practice uploading a project with a moving square to itch and check it works
 BadPiggy#5202: But fr
Maybe just go through your old projects and revise your workflows / methodologies
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: I'm SamAlexandros/TacoSauceDev
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: hey dude
 BadPiggy#5202: Watch GMTK videos
 Bart Moon#2749: Make sure are your tools are working and rest before the start
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: there's a pinned post with some ideas about preperation for the jam you could have a look at
 ThatIsANoNoWord#5311: I'm thinking about preparing for the game jam but I'm not sure how to prepare at all
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: good
 Pixstatic#3464: everyone already did
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Alright you've been asked twice now. Please take this to  rather than general chat as its become an extended conversation about specific technical mechanics
 Pixstatic#3464: I mean that's true but even measuring the time since the song started won't stay true
 theChief#0001: 
 pixal#1121: Reality
 Lascif#0184: Oh wait time.deltatime is based on time take for the last frame
 Pixstatic#3464: audio sucks :)
 Lascif#0184: What causes that desync?
 Pixstatic#3464: not at all
 theChief#0001: 😅
 theChief#0001: it is not
 Lascif#0184: Like surely if you play a song at a certain time.deltatime and track the time from that point it should be accurate to what second the point of the song is currently at.
 Coffe#5594: it is the difference between executing code according to the beat (rhythm game) and playing sound when code is executed (most games)
 MrBen#0001: oh thx!
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: there;s a list of resources pinned at the top of the channel you might find something there
 theChief#0001: it's only relevant if you want stuff to happen in time with audio
 Lascif#0184: I'm struggling to word the question right 😅
 theChief#0001: a game that uses sound in general is never synced?
 Lascif#0184: How come desyncs are more common with a rhythm game comparative to a game that uses sound in general.
 MrBen#0001: btw anyone knows good site with free sound effects?
 theChief#0001: yup, especially when you're doing audio-synced stuff lol
 Lascif#0184: Useful knowledge that
 Lascif#0184: TIL of AudioSettings.dspTime 🤔
 theChief#0001: timing in rhythm games is _so_ important
 theChief#0001: if you're making a rhythm game, you need to be using AudioSettings.dspTime and checking against that in Update 🙂 you can't ever use deltaTime or Time.time with rhythm stuff, otherwise you'll get desyncs
 pixal#1121: No I mean if you want your player to be like "I pressed that fking spacebar, then why it didn't jump"
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: stolen stadia negative latency tech
 Lascif#0184: Pretend their input got ate up like fighting games have
 Lascif#0184: Just make input an illusion
 Lawn#1538: I like to live dangerously.
 theChief#0001: rage games need that above all else
 theChief#0001: no, rage games REQUIRE consistent input 😉
 pixal#1121: Unless you're making a rage game 😂😂
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: it might be an idea to take this to tech help
 Lascif#0184: I say can be because it can also affect depending on what you call in update
 theChief#0001: never ever ever poll for inputs in FixedUpdate
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: for 2d physics there is also an option to change the simulation mode to update instead of fixedupdate, if you really want to
 Lascif#0184: Polling for inputs and checking stuff *can be* alright on Update. Because it won't affect how the game works physics wise
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: 0.01667 should be fine unless you're making a rhythm game or something
 Lascif#0184: The reason you'd want fixed update/timesteps is so actions are repeatable regardless of the machine it's on
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: default is 0.02, 1/60 is 0.01666...
 pixal#1121: One other thing is if you're using rigidbody for player character, you should turn on interpolation and continuous collision detection for less jitter
 Spencer#0545: I did not know this, thank you
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: project settings -> time -> fixed timestep
 caibi#5324: oh yeah, only 5gb RAM available now
 caibi#5324: let open up 3gb RAM ***VISUAL STUPIO*** to code some potato movement
 GodOfPro#7302: where do you change it ?
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: i have absolutely no idea why the default is 50
 M_Raven#4076: You don’t have it on my end, maybe Discord is just drunk again
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: though you really should changed the fixedupdate time to 1/60 a second or movement can look janky/juddery
 Lascif#0184: Why do I have the new here icon 🤔  I joined here last year and did the last game jam
 Lascif#0184: Like Pixal said, Fixed Update is better for game physics because it's a controlled time-step independent of the frame rate wheras update isn't fixed and will vary upon the machine.
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: the feedback for theme suggestions the day before the jam is 'the theme has already been picked and it's not that'
 pixal#1121: Well it's a good practice and suggest to have any code that manipulate game physics in fixedupdate
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: No one is required to respond to you. Secondly, good because this is the wrong channel for it
 hierr777#8659: he dont feedback
 GodOfPro#7302: do i need to have put rb.velocity code in FixedUpdate or it doesn't matter ? in a 2d game
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824:  Keep theme chat to the hype channel
 Voxaloo#9683: what are yall up to
 M_Raven#4076: But it is a good theme idea
 GM637 the LEGEND#4457: Anyways
 M_Raven#4076: 
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: the itch jam page *should* show you all the info in your own local time
 M_Raven#4076: True though
 Voxaloo#9683: bri'ish people arent real
 GM637 the LEGEND#4457: So thatll be like 01:00 on my country....good for me
 M_Raven#4076: I love how you put London in italics like it’s some kind of accusation
 GM637 the LEGEND#4457: Well im not... so i got misinformed lol
 caibi#5324: then you are in *London*?
 Voxaloo#9683: if its not the same time, its your operating systems time settings that are wrong
 M_Raven#4076: Ah, same then
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: UTC is based on greenwhich mean time
 BadPiggy#5202: I meant I'll write spaghetti code lol
 caibi#5324: time to set up the stupid unity shortcut as blender
 GM637 the LEGEND#4457: Usually the UTC time syncs with my normal time, im not sure what part of the world it presents, so i am dumfounded and probally brainfarted
 M_Raven#4076: I am going to feed myself with only sheer will
 BadPiggy#5202: I'ma get ready to cook up some spaghetti while making my game
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: what did you think UTC is
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: uh. it's 08:52 UTC
 caibi#5324: time to ~~cook~~code some potato codes
 GM637 the LEGEND#4457: The Key Info on the itch page says its like 20 minutes left, since its 16:40 UTC here, but whats the point of that? Its not similar to the actual countdown.
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: can i ask where you got the wrong time from? just to prevent other people getting confused like this
 GM637 the LEGEND#4457: Huh
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: It starts when the itch.io jam page says it starts in like 8 hours
 Pyth0n#0572: its when the countdown ends
 GM637 the LEGEND#4457: I dont get whther the jam starts in like 20 minutes or after the countdown at the top of the webpage ends
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: so its spam, it happens
 Clive Dev#0446: are you making a game in react? sounds pretty hard 😵‍💫
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: are you sure 😛
 Peter#0007: thank you thank you i'm here all weekend
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yeah you're hilarious
 Peter#0007: what did i do??? i didn't say anything?? /s
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: you don't always have to assume I'm directly talking to you
 caibi#5324: oh!
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: The countdown was someone else a little earlier, I did a double-take for the same reason
 caibi#5324: but this is not a countdown...
If anyone else is using react, make sure you specify `"homepage": "."` in your package.json 
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Keep theme guesses and countdowns to  we will less lenient with this as the jam gets closer
 Casper#6361: Honestly I never got any back
 Casper#6361: At that point I nuked my antimalware
 hierr777#8659: ironic
 HyperRays#7378: lol
 caibi#5324: jesus, my anti-malware are scanning virus for 1h 38min now, it's using 88% CPU and 42% GPU, I CAN'T DO ANYTHING
 ihapiece#4673: i am admittedly beset by anticipation
 FasterThanAnarchy#9089: He's saying the theme is theme-like lol
 HyperRays#7378: Is this then not the actual theme then
 FasterThanAnarchy#9089: Little under 9 hours
 HyperRays#7378: Wait, doesn't the game jam start in 8 hours?
 Omegnight#7081: Wonder if it's inspired by an innovative game that was recently released
 darlingS#1797: That's the basis of all english lit analysis right there
 FasterThanAnarchy#9089: The theme of the game is to theme your game the theme of the game is to
 FasterThanAnarchy#9089: I mean that could be an interesting theme
 Coffe#5594: perfect :D
 Mark Brown#6982: It's themey
 Omegnight#7081: Really curious about the theme this year !
 Tomthefish#6960: water bottles ready
 Casper#6361: Yeah exactly
 theChief#0001: I think for that one I linked, you'd really struggle to use anything as a background - I see what you mean about struggling with distribution lol
 theChief#0001: I really love dark background + bloom
 theChief#0001: yeah 🙂
 Casper#6361: Oh and with a black/dark background or something
 DrNukeLear#2414: Distribution would shift according to gameplay anyway.
 theChief#0001: I don't tend to think too much about distribution tbh!
 theChief#0001: if I went with that, I'd use the blue for the player, green for anything interactible, purple and pink for enemies, and gold for anything extra special
 Casper#6361: Would you still some 70/20/10ish distribution or an equal distribution of each one?
 Casper#6361: Though the distribution of colours isn't really clear to me
 Casper#6361: Oh that is interesting
 Casper#6361: That site should help further improve it though
 Casper#6361: 2 years ago it was a bit too desaturated and last year it missed some variety
 Casper#6361: I usually don't do too terrible on colours
 theChief#0001: if you go for simple shapes, you want to be pretty conscious of colour choices
 Casper#6361: in part because I had to scrap everything halfway through day 1
 Casper#6361: I tried it last year but it was meh
 Casper#6361: Yeah that looks sick
 Casper#6361: Strategy games are my main interest but it often turns out too difficult to pull off with the theme
 Casper#6361: I was also toying in my head with a 2d triangulated type of style
 KadDev#8100: Thanks
 Casper#6361: For example
 M_Raven#4076: You could just try something like Thomas Was Alone, where it’s just squares and rectangles
 Casper#6361: I am sure youll still find a teammate if you keep searching!
 Casper#6361: Don't worry about it too much
 Casper#6361: depending on the theme I'd like to do something with mainly a lot of sound design stuff and programming
 KadDev#8100: I think since I don't have an artist, I need to have a very simple color palette
 Casper#6361: but I'll go light on the art this time I reckon
 Casper#6361: Yeah and lots of post processing
 M_Raven#4076: 
 KadDev#8100: That'd be good
 RedTeapot#1960: Choosing a palette goes a long way actually
 Сигма#1382: I think there's gonna be a last minute team seeking chat
 Casper#6361: Programmer art superiority
 KadDev#8100: And the whole point was as a team building exercises, for my team, and future pixel artist
 KadDev#8100: I might have to do it myself, although I have almost no experience
 KadDev#8100: Man, I still don't have a pixel artist😟
 Lyfe#8258: It was a mystery game and I forgot what the mystery was 😔
 Teslobo#8274: Neat
 Teslobo#8274: Conveniently I should get back from my flight an hour before the jam announcement
 sam2099#1958: I was really looking forward to this
 sam2099#1958: Yeah, I know
 M_Raven#4076: Solo is fun, I did it last year, but you gotta be really on top of everything
 sam2099#1958: 😭
 sam2099#1958: I don't have a team, I was thinking of doing it solo
 M_Raven#4076: All of my dreams are so weird, yet so realistic that there have been cases where I woke up thinking something I dreamt was real
 Break#1234: i havent touched unity since last years jam and ive only got 1 day to work on the game
 Break#1234: god damn im so nervous lol
 Merus#7019: In dreams, I have no taste, and so I think everything I come up with is amazing
 M_Raven#4076: Same. I get to leave early tomorrow but it’s still gonna cut out a good bit of time from working on my project. I got a team though, so I’m not too worried
 Merus#7019: I have so many ideas in dreams
 Pyth0n#0572:  Get a pen right now and write.
 Lyfe#8258: Oh god I just dreamt a really cool concept for a game but because I woke up I'm remembering less and less about it
 sam2099#1958: Man, I'm bummed out, I have to work tomorrow
 Heimvana#7189: Moodgorning
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: goodmorning chat
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: keep countdowns and theme guesses to 
 Tapu#9161: May the tastiest jam win
 Coffe#5594: jam jam
 Coffe#5594: lmao
 Pyth0n#0572: i would pay money to have a competition where contestants compete to make a jam in 24 hours
 Sapient#3138: ~~Mixed Fruit jam~~
 Sapient#3138: Ehh ig u could have also used discord attachment , do avoid any suspicion ig
 Coffe#5594: strawberry
 Tapu#9161: I wonder if GMTK jam was a fruit jam, what fruit it'd be?
 Mark Brown#6982: That's right - it was the normal GMTK logo in May, pride in June, and jam in July. Back to normal in August!
 Frozen#7676: I’m gonna try my best to make it in marks list
 RedTeapot#1960: It was changed for the jam and the pride month I believe
 VVill#0133: Has the server icon been changing or is it just me lol
 Toucan#3289: Everybody feeling ready?
 caibi#5324: thanks
 Teslobo#8274: Bottom left, gear icon
 LurkNautili#3246: I mean that Naruto guy was pretty hench
 LurkNautili#3246: Maybe there's something to it, taking it to to eleven
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: well get to it bro
 LurkNautili#3246: Man, I'm only used to doing like maybe 30 on a leg day
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yeah but you won't get the gainz
 Pixstatic#3464: I’ve prepped a lot in that I updated all of my assets I made a while ago to work with a new version of unity and I’ve bought some assets that will help
 caibi#5324: wat
 LurkNautili#3246: Can I do like ten squats instead of seventeen thousand?
 caibi#5324: oh! you know ibb.co is an image site! I thought you guys only knows imgur
 Merus#7019: but someone's gotta check
 Merus#7019: but you've been hacked twice today so who knows!
 Merus#7019: wasn't sure, ibb.co is an image site so I figured it was an image
 Merus#7019: oh good, it's just a screenshot
 caibi#5324: lmao
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: eat more fibre
 caibi#5324: *not malware link*
 Merus#7019: yes, as was mine
 caibi#5324: I'm doing it, it slow like a shit
 Delphine Noel#1196: Yo, how's everyone
 Amit.H#0786: It was a joke about Unity’s recent merge with IronSource
 Merus#7019: wow, you running the most recent version?
 IamHaPPy#2536: Bruh moment
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: I’ve prepped a lot… we made a pre jam practice game and i made some drawings and animations to practice
 AkariZero#2463: my team and I plan to meet an hour before the event and ensuring we're all synced up
 Merus#7019: I'd suggest that maybe you do a malware scan on your computer! Two accounts being compromised in the same day isn't normal.
 IamHaPPy#2536: To be honest the only prep work ive done for gmtk is watching breaking bad
 photodiode#9634: Mark "Thunder Thighs" Brown
 IamHaPPy#2536: The prep work im doing is sacrificing
 caibi#5324: hope I won't get troble this time, two accounts get hacked, MY CHROME GET HACKED TOO. ||**FUCK THAT HACKERS**||
 JJfriends#3686: Dang I forgot to put colliders on my character it's actually a feature
 Ahnaf30e#3408: indeed
 AkariZero#2463: any bug can be turned into a feature
 JJfriends#3686: But has that ever stopped anyone, I know people who've made millions off of shitty crypto protocols let's do this guys
 AkariZero#2463: Our host has shown us his secrets!
 JJfriends#3686: Dude be I honest idk how to fucking code imma throw up a horrible game
 JJfriends#3686: Me
 AkariZero#2463: I ordered food for the weekend 😄 instant noodles
 theChief#0001: the prep work I'm doing is basically this
 JJfriends#3686: Going solo never failed me I'm doing it idc
 Mark Brown#6982: 17,000 squats
 Lawn#1538: So zero jam prep for me.
 JJfriends#3686: Ready for tmrw peeps
 Lawn#1538: Fixing LED wings for a sci fi show.
 AkariZero#2463: what prep is everyone doing before their jam?
 BadPiggy#5202: Going to have to remember that at some point kek
 RedTeapot#1960: Combines really well with Godot actually because it can export the project from CLI. So you can make a script that does everything automagically
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yep
 RedTeapot#1960: Yeah, Butler is a thing. Give it a folder with your game and it'll upload it
 BadPiggy#5202: Wasn't there some tool for pushing to itch ? It was called " butler " or something
 FryDev#0372: welp, probably time to sleep
 FryDev#0372: mhm
 Ahnaf30e#3408: probably
 Ahnaf30e#3408: best way to not die in the last few minutes 👍 👍 👍 👍
 FryDev#0372: I wonder if itch will have a massive slowdown again
 Ahnaf30e#3408: so that when i push my project to github it automatically pushes my game to itch.io
 Ahnaf30e#3408: i am trying to make the auto build thing work for my project
 ExMarcs#9048: Im unique
 Ahnaf30e#3408: smh mark that down in ur brain so that marking is never lost in the marks of markings again
 Phallo#3476: C? Impostor!
 Big Cheese#7612: i can't take any mark
 cheesepizza#3335: i lost my marking in mark discussion
 ExMarcs#9048: But im the real Marc
 FryDev#0372: I’m happy to remark your marking mistake if marking is ever mistaken to not be marked
 Big Cheese#7612: hitman 2 for each of you
 Ahnaf30e#3408: would mark like that marking?
 cheesepizza#3335: thanks for marking my marking mistake mark
 cheesepizza#3335: ill mark in on my record with a marker
 FryDev#0372: mark it on the permanent record then
 cheesepizza#3335: that will leave a mark
 FryDev#0372: you have to get top marks
 Big Cheese#7612: you get the mark of mark
 cheesepizza#3335: if my name is mark , do i get the mark role ?
 Big Cheese#7612: 90's fighting games
 Phallo#3476: Yea it is "won't have" and that it because you are not supposed to delete things when you are done with them... Usually if it was something you found out was a bad idea later you would change it to "won't have" just before you close the task off
 Сигма#1382: Even bad games can become successful with a proper marketing campaign 😉
 Merus#7019: all my games turn out like Warcraft in space, for some reason
 Сигма#1382: You just need to apply more on the marketing department
 Merus#7019: I am very bad at game dev
 FryDev#0372: simple
 Merus#7019: I like to use Moscow: Marketing, Originality, StarCraft, Onboarding, Wow factor
 FryDev#0372: yeah
 Сигма#1382: Although I might have been told wrong. It's easy to have the wrong terms when you have acronyms
 Сигма#1382: Maybe to delimit things? "I won't have this in my project, so it's out of the question"
 FryDev#0372: although I’m not sure
 FryDev#0372: I don’t see why “won’t have” would be useful, if something will definitively not make it into your game why mark it as a task
 Сигма#1382: Wasn't the W something like "Won't have"?
 FryDev#0372: then you split your tasks between them and go through them in order
 Сигма#1382: I just learned about it when I was developing a mobile app. It was very handy
 FryDev#0372: Must have, Should have, Could have, Would have
 FryDev#0372: I like to use Moscow
 MrGeko#4743: You want something *playable* as fast as you can, once it's a game you can add content and polish
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: you always want to puts tasks into essential and desirable and then order by priority
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: set a time amount forr polish and a time amount for building and exporting, eg you want to give yourself 4 hours to build and export and 6 hours for polish. So when it gets to 10 hours to go you finish the task you are on and move on to polish no matter what, tough cookies if something important didn't make it, you ran out of time
 WorkingJoe#4433: So take care to prioritize to begin with, basically
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: start removing low priority tasks
 WorkingJoe#4433: Any tips on what to do ~~if~~ when you end up running behind schedule?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: You **must** have a windows or an HTML build in order for the game to not be disqualified, all other platforms are good because they allow other people to play your game but they are optional
 Big Cheese#7612: thanks
 PepperBoi#4544: To do that go to edit game then more then admins
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: just one person but they can add all the other people to the project so that it shows up on their itch page
 WorkingJoe#4433: The Japanese RPG (not actual gameplay) move
 Selviam#7268: so the main platforms for the jam is gonna be windows mac linux html
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Keep countdowns and theme guesses to 
 Big Cheese#7612: sorry, if this is redundant but: should everyone submit the game or just one contributor with proper credits attached
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: having good screenshots and/or gifs of your game definitely helps, however if someone can't play your game they probably won't give you a rating
 WorkingJoe#4433: As in, the game shouldn't be judged based on that
 WorkingJoe#4433: Or is this somewhat questionable wrt the rules
 Сигма#1382: Got it. I will discuss with my team a little bit after the game jam starts so we can have a course of action prior to submission. We should be fine since we are using Godot
 WorkingJoe#4433: Would it help to share some gameplay footage on itch so that people that may have compat issues can still get an idea of things?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: If you haven't already then make a project with a simple moving square, export it and put it on itch.io and test it works. You don't want to be testing if it works during the time limit
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: if you want the most amount of people to be able to play it then releasing it for multiple platforms will help, but you don't have to. I would build the game and get it exported and working beofre worrying about second platforms
 Selviam#7268: a week went by so faaaaaaast
 Selviam#7268: i forgot that i needed to figure out HTML before the jam started and how audio works 💀
 WorkingJoe#4433: But there's a lot of people playtesting
 WorkingJoe#4433: I'm also a bit worried to have my game not work for others especially since I'll be using a funny engine
 PepperBoi#4544: Only if you have extra time
 Сигма#1382: I just wanted to confirm something quick. If I want to offer my game on browsers, should I try to make the extra effort so that they work on the user's computer as well?
 WorkingJoe#4433: Classic
 Selviam#7268: my unity editor just crashed on me with no warning 😎 (also this is for a personal project game not a jam game)
 FryDev#0372: mhm
 IceyMations#9584: on my phone
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I just take a screenshot of my game screen
 WorkingJoe#4433: I use paint.net a lot
 IceyMations#9584: i might make mine on ibspaint x
 FryDev#0372: I mean software recommendation
 PepperBoi#4544: I use aseprite to make my thumbnails and just scale it up
 WorkingJoe#4433: If you have a character or main subject it's nice to put that on the thumbnail
 FryDev#0372: the software I usually use always gives blurry thumbnails
 FryDev#0372: also, does anyone have a recommendation for making an itch thumbnail
 WorkingJoe#4433: 👉 👈
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: no
 IceyMations#9584: do you have to have a team
 FryDev#0372: well, probably should remember to get good sleep before the jam
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yeah there's always people floating around to give help and advice etc and there's always free assets etc that can be used
 Big Cheese#7612: i'm definitely using this
 Nobody6502#8971: cool
 FryDev#0372: neat
 Merus#7019:  will open 8 hours before the jam starts, in fact
 Mark Brown#6982: we will have a channel for last minute team finding, which will open during the jam
 BadPiggy#5202: Seems cool. I'll probably look into it after the jam lol
 WorkingJoe#4433: I feel like if you really needed something to finish your game in time I'm sure there are people willing to help
 Liam Carney#5890: yeah, any proper DAW would need some experience before trying to make somthing within this time limit 😅
 FryDev#0372: maybe I’ll have a musician last minute for music
 BadPiggy#5202: Where all my Bosca ceoil users at
 FryDev#0372: I’m going solo as well
 JJfriends#3686: Excited for tmrw guys going solo
 Сигма#1382: Well, I gotta start installing my OS, so then I can install Godot, so then I can start my blank project 🙂
 WorkingJoe#4433: Would definitely recommend checking out fearofdarks music regardless of whether you'll use famitracker or if you want to do chiptune
 Lawn#1538: Trackers are great if you’ve had experience with them but I wouldn’t recommend them without some prior experience. That’s why always recommend Chiptone. It has a randomise button and takes seconds to produce sounds.
 Сигма#1382: Famitracker is GOAT. It's so sad that development has completely stalled
 FryDev#0372: alright making a blank project
 jermrellum#5051: just make all your music in mariopaint
 WorkingJoe#4433: Fearofdark sold me on famitracker
 Big Cheese#7612: Louie Zong made an album of twelve 30 seconds-1:30 long songs made in wario diy
 WorkingJoe#4433: Absolutely! I won't be able to not make it sound corny in this timeframe though, mostly speaking for myself in this case. Also greatly up to personal preference
 Big Cheese#7612: wario diy
 Lawn#1538: Depends on the musician
 Liam Carney#5890: There is definitly quite a bit you can find online. If anyone is looking at a decent Chiptune DAW would be Famitracker but it does take a bit to get used to it
 WorkingJoe#4433: Famitracker is really nice
 FryDev#0372: so chiptone will probably work
 jermrellum#5051: I use some weird tools, like Korg Gadget for Nintendo Switch or famitracker to make music
 FryDev#0372: usually I have pixel art games
 WorkingJoe#4433: Game jam music can get really corny though haha
 Lawn#1538: Depends on the game
 WorkingJoe#4433: I'm not really planning on music too much, I feel like just sound cues or ambient sounds go a lot further in many cases
 Lawn#1538: I strongly recommend Chiptone.
 Lawn#1538: It depends on the style.
 FryDev#0372: I definitely won’t be doing the music myself
 Lawn#1538: For my project, I’ve installed my tools (rainbow hierarchy/folders, FMOD, and shaders) and folder structure for the project. Setting up some simple materials for your models would also be handy, I’ve got some base colours and a skybox ready to go.
 WorkingJoe#4433: I've been trying out bespoke synth, open source DAW like editor that's very useful to make short more musical things
 IsCaibiAgain#7927: 🥁
 FryDev#0372: cool
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: there's a pinned post with some resources you can look at
 FryDev#0372: other than BFXR
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Keep count downs and theme guesses to 
 FryDev#0372: are there any recommendations for getting sound effects
 WorkingJoe#4433: It's like pixel art for 3D, I love the accessibility of it
 WorkingJoe#4433: Would definitely recommend it
 WorkingJoe#4433: I've been going over the PS1 style workflow before this jam, if I get any 3D ideas that stuff can get you pretty nice looking results in decent time
 Ahnaf30e#3408: same
 Cearáj#9556: that's the most easily overlooked part to me
 TheGameShePlays#7762: I've got a list of all my assets, and a little note with my top three types of game I could code quickly and build on
 Cearáj#9556: oh yeah, definitely remember to leave time for sound
 Lawn#1538: Pre-install all of your tools before the jam starts.
 IceyMations#9584: i will be making my own assets
 theChief#0001: You can also make a list of tools you're thinking of using and any sites where you can get assets if you don't have a team
 Lawn#1538: Day two is dedicated to game feel and music.
 WorkingJoe#4433: (let me just finish this thing first moment)
 Lawn#1538: I plan to have the game mechanic finished within the first 3-4 hours.
 WorkingJoe#4433: Because I can tell you ahead of time that you will otherwise be eating 3 hours later than usual
 Lawn#1538: Eating and sleeping is also important to factor in.
 FryDev#0372: I was thinking that
 Lawn#1538: I’d start with working out how much time you might want to set aside for each task.
 WorkingJoe#4433: Eating and sleeping
 FryDev#0372: probably sleeping and eating times
 Cearáj#9556: yeah planning it all is the only way I've actually finished a jam personally
 FryDev#0372: what would be good to plan out
 Lawn#1538: A vague plan is better than no plan.
 Lawn#1538: Definitely do a little planning at the start of the jam. Or even right now.
 WorkingJoe#4433: It's like yahtzee, the menu is 5 equal die
 FryDev#0372: planning would probably be a pretty good thing
 FryDev#0372: hm
 WorkingJoe#4433: Cinematic renders in the menu background, actual game is a breakout clone
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: make a list of features you want, split them between essential and desirable
order the lists by priority
start with the first thing on the essentials list and as time runs out cross off stuff on the desirable list
 Cearáj#9556: perfection
 WorkingJoe#4433: AAA main menu for the 4 hour jam game haha
 Cearáj#9556: but after a while it's easier to just start it from some template (that you probably have done in previous games)
 Lawn#1538: At least get the quit buttons and next scene going.
 Cearáj#9556: god I hated doing them at first
 Lawn#1538: I tend to do menus pre-jam tbh.
 theChief#0001: I tend to do them first if I haven't had an idea, last if I've got something to work with xD
 Lawn#1538: It’s a *‘nice to have’* feature. Not a necessity.
 theChief#0001: You'll be quitting a LOT of games with alt f4 lol
 Lawn#1538: Yeah menus are the last thing I would worry about.
 theChief#0001: Don't worry too much about that, it's not critical - helps make it feel more complete, but most games won't have it
 WorkingJoe#4433: Feels like things I'm not taking into account enough
 jermrellum#5051: yeah menus take longer than you'd think sometimes
 WorkingJoe#4433: I'm honestly the most worried about all the stuff like main menus etc.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: thats a good breakdown oftime
 WorkingJoe#4433: I am optimistically planning to get a working prototype mechanic with placeholder assets on day 1 (Friday evening for me), then use Saturday for adding content and assets and Sunday for the final bit of polish and uploading
 🅳O🅳OTEK#6054: Blueprints
 jermrellum#5051: I mean I still overestimate what I can get done -- just made a test game for this jam (in 48 hours) cuz i never coded in unity before and only ended up implementing half the stuff I thought I'd do but got just enough for the game to actually be a game
 Сигма#1382: Oh, nice! Do you code in blueprints, or you go straight into C++?
 Merus#7019: Mark's experiences in Brackeys Jam or something would make for a great Developing video
 FryDev#0372: the only way he could probably participate without rating biases would be through a dummy account
 theChief#0001: Ah fair enough - you do you 😂 but it sounds like you have a pretty good idea for how long things take you. People who are new to jams don't really have that skill yet!
 🅳O🅳OTEK#6054: I chose UE4. Because I worked on it the most.
 Merus#7019: Mark's mentioned that he's tempted to join a different jam, but he probably won't ever participate in the GMTK Jam
 🎏momke🎏#0529: he would do good i think
 🎏momke🎏#0529: someday mark should join the jam
 Сигма#1382: I'll go with Godot, since it's the lightest of all professional level, and really beginner-friendly. What about you?
 jermrellum#5051: No I've done all 5 of the GMTKs and I've finished top 50% each time, I'm just saying even after 24 hours the games are barely even close to being done, everything really comes together right at the end
 Merus#7019: there's still  but we'll be opening  in a few hours
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: the last minute team finder channel will open soon
 🅳O🅳OTEK#6054: What engine do you have? Unity or Unreal?
 🎏momke🎏#0529: they are good at art i swear
 theChief#0001: Nah, you'd be surprised how quick you can be! I've done 20+ half an hour jams xD just scope small, don't try to make something with a complicated character controller (i.e. a platformer), and chill out ☺️
 FryDev#0372: I think maybe I’ll plan out what to do at what times
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: my recommendations
The Week before:
Get a team together if not working solo
Tell friends/Family you have less availability that weekend
Get some food/snacks in the house 
Sign up for itch.io and join the game jam on this official page
Make a dummy project using your chosen tools, export it and launch it on itch for practice
The Day Before:
Install computer updates
Create a game page on itch.io with some placeholder information
Open up all your chose tools and set up blank projects, check your settings, install updates
Set up version control
Team meeting, double check version control across the team
Set up any other tools etc Trello and fill in anything you can/placeholder info
Keep a list of an license info you need to include from your tools
 🎏momke🎏#0529: GIUVBE TEM A TEAM
 Slo#9127: 12 hours till start  and no team  :c
 IceyMations#9584: Same
 theChief#0001: Generally the prep work I do is:
- install a new version of Unity because I like to play with fire
- find any team members if I'm looking for that. This time I've got someone to take care of the audio!
- clear my schedule and make sure everyone knows I'm not very available
- go through old projects and rip out any reusable code, stuff I think might be useful for any situation. I've got a pretty sizable library now!
 Сигма#1382: Same here! Good luck on your game creation process. Let's do our best! :D
 jermrellum#5051: The only game I feel like I could complete in 20% of the jam time is like pong, and even that is pretty tough with all it's sin and cos
 🅳O🅳OTEK#6054: Yes 🙂
 WorkingJoe#4433: This though is something I can get behind
 IceyMations#9584: Reasonable
 WorkingJoe#4433: It's going to be very hard to focus otherwise halfway through (:
 Сигма#1382: Hello! First time doing a game jam?
 WorkingJoe#4433: You may get more done if you do sleep
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Do not make jokes about not eating/sleeping/etc for the jam. This is a fun challenge not an exercise in crunch.
 Big Cheese#7612: i will be eating constantly
 ryan123#4605: i intend to use the full 48 hours
 ryan123#4605: i will not be eating or sleeping sorry
 🅳O🅳OTEK#6054: Hello everyone!!
 Big Cheese#7612: i was just about to ask people about this
 theChief#0001: Generally you should be planning to make a game you think you can complete in 20-30% of the __time you have available__. Not the total time available in the jam 😉 I'm planning on doing two 8-10 hour days, so I'll be making a game I think I can finish in 4-6 hours
 K'miinik#3171: just be sure to keep the scope small, something someone else said is that you want to have the base game done in the first day, then you use the second day to polish it
 Сигма#1382: I think you are fine. I don't have anything prepared in terms of assets or code
 K'miinik#3171: i've never done any preperation, so whatever
 krill#0212: Do you all think is risky to only have a sprite template as preparation for the jam? First time jammer so I have no idea hahaha
 K'miinik#3171: exactly
 hcs#5556: This is a great point, I find myself blocked on my "Main Project", the jam lets me do something that doesn't matter so I'm not as hung up on it.
 WorkingJoe#4433: I'd spend like months just getting some overly technical thing to work, only to do nothing with it
 K'miinik#3171: yeah, i've been working on a remake of a jam game i made a while back, so that it can actually have proper gameplay this time lol
 WorkingJoe#4433: Relatable
 ryan123#4605: yea hopefully i’ll finish my first real game by the end of the jam, all i’ve been working on for the past two years are tech demos
 Cearáj#9556: i join just for the sake of getting myself to work
 Big Cheese#7612: anime tournament arc
 K'miinik#3171: i join just for the sake of getting myself to work on a different idea without having it become the new main idea, lol
 jermrellum#5051: I got top 100 first year when there were only 700 games, but that's never happening again lul
 Cearáj#9556: more broadly the goal would be to make a game and learn from it
 WorkingJoe#4433: I'd await the theme for that one, some ideas will work exclusively for one of the two
 theChief#0001: And out of probably 5,000+ entries, coming top 100 with your first jam game when there are career devs taking part is going to be a considerable show of talent and luck lmao
 photodiode#9634: I join on the off chance I get nice feedback \:')
It feels so good
 wren#0640: I'd consider top 50% a "win" tbh, gmtk games are always really good
 ryan123#4605: i can’t decide if i’m going to make a 2d or 3d game
 RedTeapot#1960: Top 20 aka Mark's video actually
 WorkingJoe#4433: If you finish a game at all you win
 jermrellum#5051: You basically came in first place if you got in top 100, considering there's like over 5000, and that's the batch mark plays (that's the goal right, get mark to play your game?)
 theChief#0001: Jams with prizes are even worse 😂 so much cheating
 Cearáj#9556: people joining jams that have prizes: *sure*
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: night
 theChief#0001: And shouldn't be treated as one
 theChief#0001: You're not going to win, so nothing to worry about ☺️ it's not a competition
 wren#0640: don't go into a jam expecting to win like ever
 FryDev#0372: this is my first GMTK, but definitely not my first jam
 IceyMations#9584: I kinda want to win, but at the same time I don’t, cause I just want to have fun. Plus this is my first jam ever
 FryDev#0372: good time to prepare
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Mark and his wife know the theme and that's all. Everyone will know it in a little over 12 hours so you can just be patient
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: My server does our own Jams and talk about other ones. But, it's more for just working on other projects and chatting with other devs.
 Selviam#7268: hey can you send me a link to the server ive been looking for a new game dev server to join
 theChief#0001: I actually really love the size of it, it's nice and small because it doesn't have a YouTuber attached 😉
 WorkingJoe#4433: We should get a neural network to host the jam so even mark can join
 Big Cheese#7612: mark him talk
 Cearáj#9556: extremely bad server I like it
 FryDev#0372: we have to get it from him early
 photodiode#9634: Oh pops, didn't even occur to me!
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Sick!
 theChief#0001: It's a smaller offshoot from Jonas Tyroller's server, more focused on jams than anything else!
 FryDev#0372: he knows the theme?!?
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: If I ever win my Jam, I pull my own submission. I'm not allowed to win.
 WorkingJoe#4433: Mark knows the theme!!
 photodiode#9634: Ah yeah, I guess it could be unfair during voting
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Is it really? Lmao
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: No he won't
 theChief#0001: Game Dev Bois, a server I help run xD
 photodiode#9634: Anyone know if Mark will join this jam? (I don't know if he would have the time even if he wanted)
 FryDev#0372: Game Dev Bois
 theChief#0001: That's fair, yeah 😂 if I take part, I generally don't submit
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Gdb?
 FryDev#0372: I couldn’t come up with an idea for the last bullet hell jam
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I also sleep immediately after starting the Jam. Lol.
 theChief#0001: The gdb jams tend to be run by 2 or 3 of the mods
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I sometimes like to participate in my own Jams. So, I feel like waiting for the last minute doesnt put me at an advantage.
 Dabt#7840: I like theme pool jams more, everyone submits a theme, admins moderate them and make sure they aren't repeats or worded differently and then it's luck of the draw
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I do my own process of throwing ideas on a board and narrowing it down to the best 3 or 5. Then pick what I feel like. Lol.
 Big Cheese#7612: voting feels like it detracts from the point of the jam
 PepperBoi#4544: Its always extra sad with LD cause they sometimes get good themes in the final round but everyone always chooses a bad one
 theChief#0001: Oh, for ours we decide months in advance and make a proper graphic 😂
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I dont do it for mine. I just wait until the last hour and make a shitty graphic revealing what I felt should be the theme. Lol.
 theChief#0001: It really is, every game jam I've been part of with a theme voting system has been riddled with cheats and people complaining that "theme bad". It often is, but what do you expect from a public vote 😂
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I dont like theme voting.
 photodiode#9634: Theme voting sounds like a bad time
 theChief#0001: The final one of which is all the most popular theme suggestions from the previous votes, and decides which theme will be used!
 theChief#0001: Everyone suggests three themes, then there's a round where you go through as many themes as you can and say whether you like them or not. They choose the top 50 or so, then have four rounds of voting
 Dabt#7840: And attempts to rig it
 wren#0640: theme voting always leads to people correctly guessing themes and making full games possibly weeks before a jam
 Big Cheese#7612: whats the ludum dare jam system
 theChief#0001: Which is why I don't like theme votes 😂
 photodiode#9634: Something simple like "Backwards" could be fun
 theChief#0001: I find that it actually ends up with a bad theme almost every time, it usually ends up being the theme that most people had an idea for when they voted
 Dabt#7840: Oh
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Ludum Dare
 Dabt#7840: LD?
 jermrellum#5051: I wrote a 10 paragraph essay about the hidden intricacies of mechanic as metaphor for the lowest rated browser playable (and actually for real playable) game for last year's gmtk, and unfortunately the game is now removed from the scratch servers
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yeah thats because the LD system ends up  themes that most people find "not bad"
 FryDev#0372: pretty good themes
 K'miinik#3171: ye
 Merus#7019: as you can see, a lot of the themes are design and mechanics focused rather than theming
 tykenn#8548: It's kind of fun going through the thousands of theme submissions for ludum dare, because many of them are laughably terrible.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Keep theme guesses to  not the general chat thanks
 WorkingJoe#4433: 2022: giraffes
 Сигма#1382: The "Only One" sounds tough
 K'miinik#3171: 2022: no way home
 Dabt#7840: I'm hoping it doesn't involve death because I hate themes with death in it
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Dual Purpose Design
[genre] without [mechanic]
Only One
Out of Control
Joined Together
 Сигма#1382: oh, then I will struggle to come up with something good for the first few hours after the theme is revealed, then, lol
 jermrellum#5051: 2017: Dual purpose design, 2018: genre without mechanic, 2019: only one
 FryDev#0372: so it’s probably be pretty vague with a lot of interpretations
 theChief#0001: Mark's wife 😂
 wren#0640: does anyone know other than mark?
 FryDev#0372: 2020: Out of Control, 2021: Joined Together
 Dabt#7840: Where
 PhatClark#4023: I hope the theme is "Cheese Rolling Competition." That leaves a lot of creative space.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: you can see the previous themes, it'll probably be something along those lines
 K'miinik#3171: i am the senate
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: It ruins the vibe of the jam
 theChief#0001: Jam participants rarely know what makes a good theme
 Сигма#1382: If the theme is something abstract like courage, I will go crazy
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I hate democracy
 K'miinik#3171: true
 theChief#0001: (when choosing a theme 😉)
 theChief#0001: I don't like democracy
 PhatClark#4023: I dont like knowing the theme ahead of time, or at least the theme pool
 theChief#0001: The YouTube video is already queued up to premier at the right time, so I'd say there's a pretty good chance of this yeah 😉
 PhatClark#4023: But genuinley smart pick
 Merus#7019: don't know her, she sounds nice though
 WorkingJoe#4433: He can have two wives (one will be male)
 FryDev#0372: that was quick
 Merus#7019: position is taken
 WorkingJoe#4433: New plan for next year
 PhatClark#4023: I want to be marks wife
 theChief#0001: Nope, the theme is decided by Mark
 K'miinik#3171: if i had to guess the theme is already decided
 Dabt#7840: It's why I set times to work on smth, times up I move on
 Merus#7019: yes, you need to be Mark's wife
 WorkingJoe#4433: There is not
 PhatClark#4023: Is their anywhere that you can vote for themes?
 Merus#7019: instead of spending 2 hours banging at a problem, go outside and touch some grass and walk around, and you'll start thinking more big-picture rather than what's just in front of you
 WorkingJoe#4433: All I did for prepping is run through all all the software I'll be using practicing the workflow
 Merus#7019: also make sure you take breaks! a 30 minute walk will make you way more efficient when you get back because it'll put you into a different mode of thinking
 K'miinik#3171: oh nice
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: there's also a list in the pinned post here and in the art/tech/sound rooms containing a bunch of resources you might find helpful
 Dabt#7840: *if I plan to work 2h on art 2h on art it will be whether I need more or not*
 K'miinik#3171: opengameart sometimes has music, other than that, just look stuff up and check the license
 Dabt#7840: I like to segment jams into parts and don't go overboard in those times, it helps me keep going and not get stuck in parts for a large part
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Like I said, there's no way to functionally police this so we instead ask that you be smart enough just to not keep going on about it
 Merus#7019: at this stage the most productive planning you should be doing is working out logistics - do you have food and drink, when are you going to sleep, how are you timeboxing your weekend
 ADEEL#5105: Any site u know
 Selviam#7268: but i like trying to make my own assets
 K'miinik#3171: just use free assets for audio, easy
 Сигма#1382: I'm going completely from scratch. I haven't even set up assets or code scripts or anything, I will just come up with whatever
 Dabt#7840: I mean like if I'm using diegetic UI or not, or if I'm having UI at all, I like to know this things just to I have a time map
 ADEEL#5105: No
 Selviam#7268: same here im so screwed on audio
 IceyMations#9584: I know animation and art so im good with that, for story, depends on the theme. Audio, I have no clue
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: lol
 Merus#7019: my pre-jam idea is to troll the jammers by saying I'm going to give a hint to the theme and then giving the definition of the word 'theme'
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yeah except you don't know how the UI will look until you know what the game is. For real just don't talk about planning stuff before hand this isn't difficult
 K'miinik#3171: I'm just gonna make a youtube video for this jam instead of a game
 Dabt#7840: I ain't planning any key gameplay features before the theme drops, waste of brain power
 wren#0640: im gonna try to get some sleep in before the jam
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: 🤯  how dare
 Dabt#7840: I'm pre-planning ideas just generic ones like how UI will look, or if I want to add specific features like settings or complex level design
 wren#0640: im gonna make a video game for this jam i think
 Wormdas#5400: Out of scope
 Selviam#7268: the prejam idea for my game is for it to be *playable*
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Remember you may NOT design your game before the theme starts, I would advise you to refrain talking about pre-planning ideas
 Dabt#7840: Planning to make a game now with specific goals is a bad idea, any weird theme will just throw that out the window
 IceyMations#9584: I once tried to put a game on itch, forgot you actually need a game
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: If people aren't sure what to do in advance or how to get set up there's a pinned post with some suggestions people might find helpful
 Selviam#7268: i really thought about making a game about a little spider but then i realized i have no clue how to do that so i either do platformer or like an agar.io sort of game
 theChief#0001: Yep!
 theChief#0001: Your profile page -> edit theme, then there's a list of what you want to show
 wren#0640: does a link still lead to it?
 theChief#0001: You can hide it from your itch page without removing it ☺️
 Dabt#7840: Just the movement and camera part, I don't need shooting
 FryDev#0372: I always use the screenshake code
 Dabt#7840: Just gonna yoink my smooth fps system from my side project and I'll be good
 jermrellum#5051: yeah the translation issue makes sense
 tykenn#8548: I'm doing 3D. I kind of want to make a one-room mini rpg, but seeing how jams usually go for me, I'll probably quickly abandon that idea once I hear the theme.
 wren#0640: my only game on itch is a game i made the week i started game dev and i cant take it down because i dont wanna leave the person who composed for it with a dead link on the bandcamp page for the soundtrack
 FryDev#0372: yep, quite helpful
 Selviam#7268: ive been having internet problems all day it better resolves by tomorrow
 Dabt#7840: Cool, that cuts me like 4h of work
 Сигма#1382: Anything goes, but mostly 2d, although the specific genre, I have no idea
 Dabt#7840: I'm probably doing smth first person with either puzzles or horror
 AEIOU#0652: In rules it says yes
 Selviam#7268: this also reminds me to hide my old old bad games bc last game jam i was in ppl looked at them
 FryDev#0372: I know I’ll make either a 2D platformer or a 2D top-down
 Dabt#7840: Are we allowed to use repurposed scripts for basic stuff like movement
 Professor Pickles#8498: likely a 2d top down, but maybe a platformer
 Cearáj#9556: actually no it's still 1:30 am here
 FryDev#0372: not really
 Tapu#9161: Finding a good name is hard af
 IceyMations#9584: Do you guys have an idea of what type of game ur making? Like 3d,2d,platformer,rpg, etc
 Cearáj#9556: too late
 Selviam#7268: IM SO EXCITED i wanna know the theme already
 FryDev#0372: I was going to say, “how can you have a name if you don’t even have an idea yet?”
 wren#0640: ill make a blank itch page rn
 Tapu#9161: And a backup name
 AEIOU#0652: Setup everything in advance
Itch.io page
Basic editor setups
Some arts
 K'miinik#3171: oh boy, windows update, brb
 Wormdas#5400: I believe you're right that the compiler handles mapping for you. The bigger concern is the concern that's omnipresent in development, which is "If we end up needing to do more / something else, how much of a pain in the neck is it going to be to do that?" For example, if you want to localize your game to a different language, are we going in and writing a million more switch cases, or are we giving our translator a table to fill out translations in and automatically switching to a different hash map based on the selected language? I'd also be a little bit concerned going "Meh, compiler's got it" because compilers are typically constructed to be a little careful when unrolling things and you put yourself in danger of slowing things way down if you access something inappropriately
 Ulbert#3253: 👍 😢
 wren#0640: by the end of saturday i want to have something submit-able finished
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Don;t ping Mark for no reason
 Dabt#7840: Stay up all week *don't actually*
 jermrellum#5051: I think last year I stayed up all night but then submitted 8 hours early anyway
 wren#0640: im gonna pull a late night today if i can manage it and then go pretty regular sleep for the rest of the jam i think?
 Scolon#4218: Oh man im getting too excited already, sleep time
 FryDev#0372: 12 hours, oh boy
 K'miinik#3171: same, i woke up at half past midnight
 WorkingJoe#4433: I don't think my body realises what I am about to do to it
 BadPiggy#5202: The theme is getting announced roughly two hours before I usually sleep lol
 Сигма#1382: So, it is matter of the code size, and the text available. Things get really muddy when you are at such at high level, but when your switch statement is huge, it might not fit in cache, which can slow down when accessing it. Now, when you text in the mix, depending on how the game engine does it, it might group all dialogue related stuff so that it is faster to access it depending on the area that is loaded (for example, when you are at Grillby's, sans' dialogue is faster to fetch because it's already in RAM, compared to Toriel's dialogue, because it is currently in disk)
 WorkingJoe#4433: I have just woken up way too early today
 wren#0640: id still make something but thatd be such a lame set back
 wren#0640: oh god i hope i dont sleep through the theme announcement
 Dabt#7840: "AI move to", it moves on its own, avoids obstacles, follows specific actors, can move to any area, does stuff on fail and success movements
 K'miinik#3171: bloom and wither, oh wait that was artfight
 Cearáj#9556: I've just heard that so far it sucks but I haven't tried it myself either tbf
 BadPiggy#5202: It's time peeps
Place your bets for the theme
 Dabt#7840: Like damn, I code my AI with a single blueprint node lmao
 Dabt#7840: You can probably type a function you need and it probably exists in some way
 BadPiggy#5202: Almost 12 hours to the theme
 Cearáj#9556: perfect
 Dabt#7840: I like to call blueprints, scratch on cocaine
 Shroomax#3378: Ah yes
**S C R A T C H**
 Selviam#7268: i remember trying to use rpg maker and loosing my MIND because i couldnt figure out why the plugin that would let me use sprite sizes bigger than 32x32 wasnt working
 K'miinik#3171: realistically if i wasn't used to normal scripting, i would probably prefer visual scripting
 jermrellum#5051: I would assume that the problem with putting things in a switch is more about space than speed though, since it would map right?  so it would be constant time, just all the text would be in RAM?  But text is tiny so that would probably still be less than 1mb, even for a game like undertale
 Dabt#7840: Blueprints ARE  scratch
 wren#0640: ive never personally tried it but godots visual scripting looks really neat actually
 Cearáj#9556: doesn't beat
**S C R A T C H**
 theChief#0001: Do not use unreal for this 😂 especially not ue5. UE5 is UE4 with some extra features that make performance much worse in most cases!
 Dabt#7840: Unreal's visual scripting is ahead of all others, more features more readability and organization, better UI
 WhyIamHere#0329: in algeria the internet is soo slow so i use it at 3 am 4am to play or watch anime
 Cearáj#9556: *some of the engines suck at it tho*
 theChief#0001: It won't slow your game down enough to worry during a jam, it's mostly an issue of code readability/usability - and in a jam, that doesn't matter at all 😁
 Сигма#1382: Switch statements are not necessarily bad. It is just that if you find yourself constantly changing it, it is better to abstract it away in a more dynamic form so that you can have more freedom in what you are allowed to modify
 Shroomax#3378: you should put your dialogue in a different file like xml or json. the switch statements may work for a quick solution, but for a fully fledged game, consider using a different place to store everything
 Dabt#7840: Yes buts it's pain
 Cearáj#9556: visual scripting is fine, that's just another way of showcasing code
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: depends on the size of the game. Its probably not ideal but how much it will slow down depends. Undertale was coded with all its dialogue in one switch so.... yeah
 GameboyFunny101#0057: yea my bad
 wren#0640: 13 actually
 AEIOU#0652: Can unreal 5 make 2d game like stardew valley
 GameboyFunny101#0057: just 13 more hours
 Dabt#7840: Ik some people treat it like it's not, I personally use it because is faster for me
 CodingLord#1012: bro you should sleep
 K'miinik#3171: yup, and there's even a grid based battle system plugin
which is what i used
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Do not joke about not sleeping during the jam. its not crunch training
 theChief#0001: Visual scripting is still programming, it uses all the same skills it is just presented differently
 Shroomax#3378: good luck
 FryDev#0372: I’m gonna run myself into the ground
 jermrellum#5051: OK but actually is putting a whole bunch of dialogue in a switch statement bad?  does that slow your game down?
 Shroomax#3378: alright guys see you all tomorrow(or later today) i am gonna have my last 10 hour sleep in before 2 days of constant coffee
 Cearáj#9556: (from what I remember from their old devlogs)
 Сигма#1382: Last time I checked the RPG Maker related forums, I saw an action based battle system
 Dabt#7840: Tho, bolt sucks
 Dabt#7840: All of those have visual scripting, so you don't have to "code" either
 wren#0640: i should check out construct at some point, seems like a really good prototyping tool
 K'miinik#3171: plugins can actually help quite a bit
still limited quite a bit tho
 jermrellum#5051: Yume Nikki, Ib, and Off I think are RPGMaker, all free games
 Shroomax#3378: yeah and IDEs are great for autocompleting stuff
 Cearáj#9556: a fork of it to be more precisely (they constantly ran into the limitations of the engine lmao)
 Wormdas#5400: Basic concepts, sure. But there's a pretty bug distinction between the amount of low-level knowledge you need to keep in your working memory if you're gonna move from a garbage collected to a non garbage collected language, or to start using pointers, to name a couple examples
 IceyMations#9584: The main reason I like construct 3 is that you don’t really have to code, it’s more like scratch then unity, unreal, Godot, etc
 AEIOU#0652: No rpg maker cant make complex rpg
It is still limited
 FryDev#0372: omori was made in RPGMaker I believe
 BadPiggy#5202: Undertale's battle system wouldn't be possible in RPG maker anyway lol.
The rest maybe
 Shroomax#3378: like for me i picked up unity like 2 years ago, c# was completely different to me because i normally used python and javascript, still managed to learn most of the stuff in like 2 weeks. the biggest confusion was the structure
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yeah once you learn the logic it doesn't change but the formatting and everything you have to learn from scratch
 Cearáj#9556: like a true madlad
 jermrellum#5051: better than an if/else tree
 wren#0640: undertale also wrote all of its dialogue in one Really Big switch statement
 Selviam#7268: i doubt undertale could be built in rpg maker last time i used it it wouldve been near impossible to make it in that system
 Сигма#1382: It's also the ecosystem around the language
 Shroomax#3378: basic programming concepts are the same in all language, it's the syntax
 Сигма#1382: Undertale is done with Game Maker
 BadPiggy#5202: Undertale is in Gamemaker
Afaik
 Selviam#7268: oh i used rpg maker it is limiting but good to start with
 Cearáj#9556: *at least it's not a subscription*
 Shroomax#3378: also i think if you have a bit of coding background, switching to another language wouldn't be that bad
 jermrellum#5051: are hylics and undertale in rpgmaker?
 Сигма#1382: And the more recent iterations of it offer scripting in JavaScript, which is the most used programming language in the world
 Cearáj#9556: rpg maker sounds kinda limiting but sure
 Dabt#7840: If u use unreal u don't need to use c++
 K'miinik#3171: if only there was a creator for rpgs, a maker even
 Wormdas#5400: I don't like Unreal because I don't like Visual Scripting and Unreal C++ is an entirely different language from normal C++
 Сигма#1382: RPG Maker already has a lot of builtin stuff
 Shroomax#3378: imagine i decided to hate myself and learnt C++ in 12 hours just to make a game from scratch in it.
 tykenn#8548: I updated for a few features, like real time point light shadows and decals in URP. Was it worth it? I dunno, but it's working well enough for me for the most part.
 K'miinik#3171: if you're making an rpg, i sure do wonder what the most effective engine for that would be
 Cearáj#9556: I mean yea, it's also relative to the project. It's best if you're versatile enough to try a few engines at least
 K'miinik#3171: literally starting in about 12 and a half hours lol
 CodingLord#1012: Unreal is the best for high quality stuff and Godot is best for beginners and Unity has a little bit of the both
 Shroomax#3378: challenge accepted
 BadPiggy#5202: I'd show what I'm working on, but no image perms lol
 Scolon#4218: Also in the context of this Jam it's a bit too late to switch engines xD
 Shroomax#3378: honestly i think what it boils down to is just personal preference, and how you manage your workflow. if you like godot more / have more experience and you are really efficient at it, i'd probably stick to that instead of learning AN ENTIRELY NEW engine. that being said switching to something that's drastically better for your particular project can help you a lot
 Cearáj#9556: I wouldn't say it's the easiest but it sure has more resources
 BadPiggy#5202: Almost all of my favourite games are in Unity lol
 Amit.H#0786: I enjoy Unity a lot. The engine and the company both have their issues, but it's the easiest general-purpose game engine for beginners. and way more graphically capable than it gets credit for
 Wormdas#5400: Inscryption is a Unity game if you're still looking for examples
 Scolon#4218: Unity has a lot of tutorials due to its popularity yeah
Less popular engines are a bit more difficult to get into since you need to do a lot more of your own research
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I haven't even bothered putting unreal on this computer as I never ended up using it on my old one. I'll try it eventually
 Triggered#6897: I am studying for my exam simultaneously
 BadPiggy#5202: I can't remember the last time I saw a tutorial for Unity. Just been doing my own thing for a while now lol
 Selviam#7268: ye im watching an inscryption playthrough its so GOOOOD
 Cearáj#9556: yea ofc, there isn't even a beta out yet is there
 Сигма#1382: I think if you are starting out in Game Dev, the requirements to developing in Unity super fast are very demanding, which you might not have if you are a student with a regular laptop, and thus not a very good choice for dev speed. However, the tutorials for Unity are very friendly, so YMMV
 WhyIamHere#0329: are you just chatting or your watching anime or somthing while chatting
 BadPiggy#5202: The only unreal game I was able to somewhat run was Vampyr
 Wormdas#5400: URP performance optimizations happen pretty regularly, some changes to build targets (i.e. IL2CPP vs Mono targets for ARM X64 build targets, some Vulcan rendering stuff) but it's pretty in-the-weeds stuff
 BadPiggy#5202: I can't run unreal lol
 K'miinik#3171: how about UE1
 Selviam#7268: my reasoning: I dont wanna wait to update to another version since my unity is default to 2021.3
 Scolon#4218: I ported a project to 2021 LTS from 2019 LTS and honestly kind of regret it.
But there are a lot of new things in there that I really needed so
 Dabt#7840: I'm still in ue4 4.22.3 which is like 2 years old now
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: go on, git
 ExMarcs#9048: UE5 baby
 Merus#7019: big hunting you say
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: We'll be using 2021.3.5f1
 Wormdas#5400: Unity is much faster when you know how to use custom assemblies but who has the time
 Tapu#9161: I'm learning 3.4 as it's the stable release
 BadPiggy#5202: Question but why even use any version of Unity post 2020 ? 2018 and 2019 work wonderfully lol
 Cearáj#9556: bro mine took so much longer 😭😭😭 there was even a day it would have long loading screens for PLAYTESTING THE GAME
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Do NOT recommend godot 4 to people as if its usable, the ONLY reason gdoot 4 is even available to anyone is because big hunting goes quicker with more people and it gets broader feedback. It's still in alpha and it won't be ready for years yet. Don't talk about it as if it's a usable version of the game
3.5 isn't even out yet
 marpe#3356: unity is horribly slow
 Wormdas#5400: Moving our project at work from 2021.3.2f to 2021.3.6f nearly gave me a transient ischemic attack because of the Plastic SCM package boondoggle
 Dabt#7840: Idk what's the point in updating unity, not like they add anything ground breaking from version to version
 K'miinik#3171: i literally timed it once, and it took like, 2 minutes to open an empty project
 BadPiggy#5202: Same. Though I'll probably try and learn Godot on the side now.
 BadPiggy#5202: This is kinda what I did lol
 Scolon#4218: But yeah I'm sticking with Unity no matter what they do. I know the engine very well and can very quickly and efficiently work in it. Not going to swap
 K'miinik#3171: fr
 Wormdas#5400: Will point out though that if you're using Unity, get in an LTS and then never ever update
 Cearáj#9556: fr, I started with unity but got massively bored of the endless loading screens
and knowing that godot literally did everything instantly made me switch 
 BadPiggy#5202: That's what I meant lol. What's the latest stable version.
But okay, cool. Thanks peeps
 wren#0640: its not in feature freeze yet iirc which could cause issues when porting projects
 Wormdas#5400: Best thing to do is learn one engine in and out and then just make games.
 Dabt#7840: Godot 4 is way to early
 Triggered#6897: 3.4.4 for stable experience, 4.0 to check the latest features.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: always use the lastest stable. At the moment it's 3.4.x
 wren#0640: wouldnt really recommend godot 4 now
 FryDev#0372: yep, unfortunately Godot 4 isn’t out yet in a stable state
 Amit.H#0786: this is the way.
 Triggered#6897: 3.4.4 and 4.0 alpha8 or 9 maybe
 K'miinik#3171: my bubble was always rpgs, and i only had stuff up to the ps2, so the only 3d rpg i really played was final fantasy x. i mostly played gba games, which is the reason behind my preference
 Сигма#1382: I love Godot so much. The fact it's so lightweight makes the best choice for people starting out in game dev
 CheeseHead Games#8328: and I have never once second guessed that decision
 PepperBoi#4544: 3.4
 BadPiggy#5202: Also, if I do download Godot, which version should I download ?
 FryDev#0372: Unreal seems a little overkill for 2D
 Scolon#4218: It can, but you probably shouldn't use unreal for 2D
 CheeseHead Games#8328: I use unity because when I first started learning game dev I was learning from brackeys and that's what he told me to use
 WhyIamHere#0329: unreal engine 5 and 4 can make 2d games
 BadPiggy#5202: I think I tried Godot a long time ago lol. Made a character jump and then I just rage quited or something lol
 WorkingJoe#4433: It's like a Russian mix of unity and unreal that's free to use. It's originally made for a bit more technical stuff but that's not really a bad thing, gives it a high level of QA
 Dabt#7840: I just grabbed unreal and kinda went from there, not much thought into it
 Scolon#4218: When I first started out back in late 2018, I heavily debated going engineless and coding a lot of things from scratch. But decided I really didn't want to spend so much time working with low-level code and wanted to just make games
 wren#0640: its insane how lightweight godot is with how much you can do with it
 K'miinik#3171: I started with unity, did butano (an engine for the GBA), did a free trial of rpgmaker, then tried godot. currently i mostly use godot and butano
 Cearáj#9556: I had an xbox and played realistic AAA games back then so that was my bubble, I'd literally think any 2D game was just a silly little browser/mobile game.
*Until I played undertale*
 FryDev#0372: sorry for your loss
 WhyIamHere#0329: i just died
 Selviam#7268: then i swapped to unity bc free 👍
 BadPiggy#5202: I prefer game design over game engine dev
One of these results in a less broken head
 Dabt#7840: I don't like rollercosters
 Selviam#7268: i started with Game Maker Studio for like 2 weeks in a game design class when i was 10 and was shocked to see how much it cost when i went home and tried to download it myself
 Thorvald#1806: Should just start coding in assembly, the rollercoaster tycoon guy did it, whats your excuse?
 BadPiggy#5202: RUST
 FryDev#0372: what’s the savior unigine?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: lol
 wren#0640: theres an alternate timeline where i just Waited and am now freaking out
 WorkingJoe#4433: Unity, unreal. Haven't you guys heard about our saviour Unigine
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Most of the time ff you're making a game for a "broad audience" you don't know who the game is for. If you market towards the wring people, or use the wrong marketing towards the wrong people then you're just throwing away time and money
 wren#0640: i genuinely only went with godot because unity took too long to download
 Dabt#7840: There are non realistic games in ue4 RiME for example
 K'miinik#3171: hell, 3d in general isn't really even my style
 FryDev#0372: when I started, I tried Godot, then Gamemaker, and then I went back to Godot
 Scolon#4218: Unreal was built specifically for high-end 3D yeah
 BadPiggy#5202: Same
And I was learning .NET at the time so Unity was perfect for me
 Thorvald#1806: I started with gamemaker and got out of it before they started doing the subscription service thing
 Cearáj#9556: probably didn't even know about the existence of indie games
 K'miinik#3171: i was never interested in unreal because i pretty much only saw more realistic type games, which isn't my style at all
 Cearáj#9556: I remember I thought unity was trash and unreal was probably much cooler when I first got interested in gamedev, lmao
 Dabt#7840: They are all moving for custom solutions now
 jermrellum#5051: but not assassin's creed unity
 Triggered#6897: ~~You looking for a 12th teammate~~
 Thorvald#1806: that is true, but if you are making a game that applies to a broad audience to make money, you want to appeal to as many groups as possible
 K'miinik#3171: honestly i wouldn't be suprized if the whole unity logo thing was intentional
 Scolon#4218: Even Triple A studios will use Unity sometimes
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Free pizza! 😍
 Cearáj#9556: yeah, quite astounding
 Scolon#4218: There are a LOT of games that are made in Unity and you'll literally never know unless you googled it
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: not if your game isn't targeted towards that market
 Dabt#7840: Yeah like Java now being awfully optimized and having under the hood problems
 Cearáj#9556: those are very much interesting then
 Triggered#6897: I probably think the bad reputation is cause of mass users, not everyone is good at making game atleast not at the beginning and when someone plays a beginners game and sees a unity logo he/she subconciously believes that all games made in unity are bad
 K'miinik#3171: it might be
 FryDev#0372: I thought bedrock was made in C++
 Dabt#7840: Nah even people that are into indie games do it
 Thorvald#1806: unfortunately if you wanna make money you also gotta market towards those people
 K'miinik#3171: bedrock edition is c# but idk if it's made in an engine
 Scolon#4218: Coding games from scratch takes way longer than using an engine but it has a lot of benefits too
 Cearáj#9556: those people were probably just really damn lost to even end up in a game with a unity logo
their average game is probably realistic AAAs
I was like that, I know it
 Scolon#4218: Yes
 Dabt#7840: Minecraft is coded straight from scratch in Java right
 jermrellum#5051: Minecraft is like the most famous Java game ever
 Scolon#4218: Minecraft wasn't built on an engine
 Thorvald#1806: No, even worse, minecraft had the mojang logo
 Dabt#7840: No?
 K'miinik#3171: i mostly just play free games, so i usually wait to actually try the game
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: thats pretty much what e were talking about. How some people still see it as bad quality because of the big asset flip reputation it got
 CheeseHead Games#8328: didn't minecraft originally have the unity logo?
 Triggered#6897: ~~So unity is asking for money to remove bad reputation it might have on your game~~
 Dabt#7840: I've seen a few streamers do it
 Scolon#4218: But yeah the whole "unity reputation" among gamers mostly stems from misinformation and the fact that it IS the most popular & free engine
 Dabt#7840: Some people do see the unity logo and go "welp this game sucks" and don't play or refund it
 Thorvald#1806: I don't know what you're talking about, I make $99,000 from my lemonade stand, and only 1,000 from my game, I don't need to pay anything
 Cearáj#9556: sorry that was pretty ambigue
 BadPiggy#5202: A lot of Indies end up doing that tbh
 Scolon#4218: Right
 Cearáj#9556: I mean if you're making less than that and not needing to pay
 Scolon#4218: Well it's literally illegal to not upgrade to pro versions of Unity if you're making more than that
 Cearáj#9556: (but you'll still have to stick with the logo if you don't pay)
 Selviam#7268: well i doubt ill ever make more than 100k per year through unity so i should be fine
 Scolon#4218: Yeah, if you make less than $100k per year using Unity you don't have to pay
 BadPiggy#5202: Doesn't that only apply when you release the game ? Or if you're providing updates
 Thorvald#1806: their store says "1800/yr per seat"
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yes its a subscription. Unity is not free, you just don't have to pay until you reach a limit on the money you make
 Dabt#7840: Unreals license is "you pay us if you make more than 1 mil a year"
 Selviam#7268: oh god-
 CheeseHead Games#8328: like $1,200 a year I think to get ride of the logo
 K'miinik#3171: subscription based service, yup, which is part of why i moved to godot
 jermrellum#5051: man cuphead and hollow knight devs really hate the unity logo
 Capybara#8868: Yep
 Scolon#4218: It's not viable until you've already become a professional dev
 Dabt#7840: Most game engines have better licenses
 BadPiggy#5202: This. It's just sad and stupid for good games man .....
 Selviam#7268: its a SUBSCRIPTION?
 Scolon#4218: So like, it's not even a one time payment, you have to keep paying to have the logo gone
 CheeseHead Games#8328: yeah, it's pretty expensive
 Cearáj#9556: I guess some people assume unity is only used for low effort games because they don't see its logo in the good games that did well and paid for premium
 WhyIamHere#0329: iam playing fortnite at 4 am
 K'miinik#3171: yeah, you have to get the professional version
 Scolon#4218: iirc you need to subscribe to Unity Pro
 BadPiggy#5202: Heck, imagine if Fall guys kept the logo
 Selviam#7268: doesnt the logo cost a *ton* to get rid off too?
 Dabt#7840: Yeah but it's not a great business plan to have that logo on every piece of junk game in existence
 wren#0640: i didnt even know cuphead was made in unity huh
 BadPiggy#5202: Imagine if Hollow knight and cuphead kept the logo
Smh
 Scolon#4218: Removing the logo is expensive for people just starting out, so that just kinda happened
 K'miinik#3171: I've pretty much completely switched over to godot
 M_Raven#4076: Second part I think is just because a lot of “crappy” games have the Unity logo and eventually the logo just got associated with poor-quality games
 CheeseHead Games#8328: unity is all I use
 Scolon#4218: Unity's UI system is the only thing I don't like about it
I usually make my own tools for everything and I mainly use it for physics, rendering, and scene setups. I never looked to much into all these packages that keep coming to the store since I don't need em
 Dabt#7840: Unreal might be bloated but at least versions are good and consistent
 BadPiggy#5202: I'm still using Unity 2018.3 and I still love it to this day tbh lol
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yeah there are still people who won't use unity because of that and still think it's a "lower quality" engine
 PepperBoi#4544: Yeah but unity has like all 2d stuff in a 3d world where in Godot they are both separate things
 K'miinik#3171: yeah, my biggest issue with unity is that it's very clunky
 WhyIamHere#0329: unity is very good i used it but iam bad at C# so i used playmaker visual scripting and It wasn't good so i use gdevelop
 Dabt#7840: Unity's ui sucks, and I hate the amount of confusing versions it has that can break stuff
 BadPiggy#5202: This ffs.
Every engine has asset flips.
 wren#0640: REALLY bad typo there
 Merus#7019: looks like your account got hacked, buddy
 Cearáj#9556: I do find unity bad but that would be literally the worst reason to do so
 Dabt#7840: "no one gives a shit what game engine you used if your game is good" - First crimson
 BadPiggy#5202: I usually don't do anything too heavy in Unity lol.
Like I don't use render pipelines or anything. Everything is pretty much just sprites arranged at different angles kek
 K'miinik#3171: i sorta have the same feel about unreal, a lot of games made in it have a similar look to me, i usually chalk it up to the lighting engine, but idk
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: its fine so long as you're not using it to get around a ban/mute
 jermrellum#5051: I think also people look at specific games like Yooka-Laylee or Ocarina of Time HD Remake and they have a certain look to them even though you can kind of do anything in unity
 IsCaibiAgain#7927: Hi, caibi again, my account just got disabled, is alt in this server allowed?
 PepperBoi#4544: I've done it once in Godot but not in unity, but it seemed to work decently. It wont be as good as unity for 2.5d cause thats kind of a strength of Unity
 Cearáj#9556: hm, I haven't tried much 3D in godot just yet so idk
 Dabt#7840: They are the audience and you have to appeal to them
 wren#0640: gamers are the worst thing to happen to game development i think
 wren#0640: same group of people who say that unitys bad because their only frame of reference is asset flips probably
 Scolon#4218: But yeah I can see this becoming an issue
Unity's PR team will probably address the controversy soon enough and we'll see what happens. Too early to say anything definitive about the whole situation.
 FryDev#0372: the same thing happened with sonic origins, so it’s probably not a stretch to assume that it was Sega rushing them
 K'miinik#3171: "oh, it's a remake, you guys don't need that much time for it, yea?"
 BadPiggy#5202: Gamers just blame the engine always.
For some reason also, if you see the Unity logo it's bad or something
 Dabt#7840: Which couldve been the devs being idiots or rushing it due to constraints
 Cearáj#9556: a lot of people blamed it blindlessly anyways
 wren#0640: rather than fully in godot
 Cearáj#9556: plus it was a remaster yeah
 BadPiggy#5202: What's doing 2.5D like in Godot though as opposed to Unity ? XD
I'll probably be switching after a while
 wren#0640: i think its only something weird? like the lighting engine or something
 Dabt#7840: It's partly on it iirc
 FryDev#0372: no, different rushed port
 wren#0640: sonic colours remake iirc
 jermrellum#5051: sonic origins is a godot?
 FryDev#0372: yeah, probably just a result of Sega rushing the devs
 wren#0640: yeah im not blaming the engine at all
 BadPiggy#5202: I think Gloomgrave just released recently
 Dabt#7840: It's not the engines fault completly tho, you can't blame the games problem in the engine, it's so much likely the devs fucked up
 Cearáj#9556: in fact they didn't even credit godot at first iirc? they forgot
 wren#0640: oh this looks sick
 BadPiggy#5202: Look up " Resolutiion ". Damn good commercial Godot game
There's also " Gloomgrave "
 Cearáj#9556: lol it was funny that they didn't even use it as a whole and also modified it
 PepperBoi#4544: It has a really good workflow for 2d and decent for 3d and is super lightweight (it starts up in seconds and can export to web in seconds)
 wren#0640: 😬  really sucks that the only major commericial godot game is kinda shit lol
 Dabt#7840: I'm also using VS in unreal
 Scolon#4218: Pretty sure itch.io has systems in place that scan files
 WhyIamHere#0329: gdevelop use visual scripting its soo easy
 BadPiggy#5202: There most likely will be, but I don't want people confusing unity entries for that now just cus of that recent merger
 Big Cheese#7612: ironsource
 FryDev#0372: Godot is a FOSS engine, meaning that you never have to pay to use it, even if your game does well, GDScript is a simple and easy to pick up language, it’s lightweight for less powerful computers
 Dabt#7840: In reaction to the unity controversy there was a thread about Godot being broken and not ready for product release because a sonic game made partly on it had problems in game
 Cearáj#9556: oh? why am I not surprised
 Spartiality#1145: The language is simple
 jermrellum#5051: I mean with over 5000 entries you'd think at least one of those exe's is a virus
 BadPiggy#5202: " This game was made in Unity. 1 star "
 wren#0640: ironforge iirc? basically just straight up a malware company
 Big Cheese#7612: i've heard good things about godot language syntax
 Cearáj#9556: it's merging with something else, forgot the name
 ExMarcs#9048: Pull what kind of stuff
 BadPiggy#5202: I'm well aware of it.
Though I guarantee that there might be some people who take it seriously and pull some stuff in the jam
 ExMarcs#9048: So whats good with godot never touched it
 wren#0640: its really nice to see honestly, i was getting tired of people discounting godot as a purely "beginner" engine
 FryDev#0372: yes. godot
 jermrellum#5051: I mean yeah but don't
 Big Cheese#7612: what's happening with unity
 Dabt#7840: It's just a series of bad moves by unity that may indicate a trend
 Cearáj#9556: godot supremacy
 nekiwo#7574: cant you make and upload an html file that fetches your game even after the deadline?
 Cearáj#9556: rise
 Scolon#4218: Honestly I think a lot of people are overreacting a bit to this piece of news...
It's not going to mean anything for a while and even then it won't be *as bad* as people think it will be
 FryDev#0372: ol’ reliable
 Spartiality#1145: Can’t we just insert the html?
 wren#0640: seen a lot more godot users this jam
 jermrellum#5051: theoretically if you packaged an emulator and a rom into an exe could you make a romhack?
 FryDev#0372: I’ll be using good ol’ godot
 Spartiality#1145: Yes
 Big Cheese#7612: i think you submit the game page, but i dont know
 Dabt#7840: Gonna use ue4 because it's quicker to prototype with bp
 wren#0640: you have to upload the exe to the games itch.io page if thats what you mean?
 ExMarcs#9048: Unreal Engine lets go
 FryDev#0372: so as long as it meets those requirements, it’s good
 WhyIamHere#0329: i will use gdevelop
 jermrellum#5051: yeah no mario maker engine
 Big Cheese#7612: yeah it has to be windows compatible but mac and linux are allowed
 Spartiality#1145: Do we have to insert the exe file on the page?
 FryDev#0372: the page says “Anything, provided you can upload a file that runs on Windows or browsers, and doesn't require any additional hardware or software.”
 ExMarcs#9048: Whats not allowed
 Cearáj#9556: no *roblox* iirc
 jermrellum#5051: I think mark has a windows and he needs to run it
 Cearáj#9556: depends on what you consider an engine right
 ExMarcs#9048: Only windows or can it also run mac?
 Big Cheese#7612: ah the classic switcheroo
 Lawn#1538: That’s not entirely true.
 jermrellum#5051: as long as it runs on pc right?
 wren#0640: so long as it can export as an exe for windows or as html for web its allowed
 FryDev#0372: all engines are allowed for the jam
 BadPiggy#5202: Also um ...... This is a request for the mods or whoever can write a note on the jam page or whatever
I'm seeing a lot of  hate on unity in twitter , so maybe we should have a disclaimer on the jam page saying that games with Unity don't have any harmful programs in them right now.
Cus I have a feeling that some people are going to ignore Unity entries
 ExMarcs#9048: Any engines that are not allowed for the game jam?
 Scolon#4218: Jam starts at a perfect time for me
 WhyIamHere#0329: i will play fortnite
until 7 am and then i will sleep and wake ap at 4 pm
 Dabt#7840: *it's not mine*
 jermrellum#5051: well at least the baby delivered before the jam
 Dabt#7840: I took a nap in the afternoon and I got a 3 day old baby in the other room so it's hard to sleep
 nekiwo#7574: go to sleep at 5am and wake up at 3pm so youre ready xd
 Lawn#1538: Please sleep. Both in general, and for this jam.
 Dabt#7840: Starts at 6pm or so I think
 BadPiggy#5202: I'm guessing the jam starts at 5:30 pm for you ? Maybe sleep so that you'll actually be able to start today ? XD
 Dabt#7840: Can't sleep, tried to but couldn't
 Dabt#7840: It's 4 here too
 birdstone#3073: jesus go to bed lol get well rested before the jam starts
 WhyIamHere#0329: its 4 am in my country
 birdstone#3073: it's around 9 but i meant i just feel really tired
 FryDev#0372: I’ll just work myself into the ground I think
 WhyIamHere#0329: What time is it in your country
 birdstone#3073: i'm soo tired, hopefully tomorrow goes well lol
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: We've all made games before and have jammed before. Though, this is some of their first times working in a team.
 PepperBoi#4544: Seems like the perfect time to start
 FryDev#0372: mhm
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I only worked with a handful of them before. This will be the first time I worked with most of them. All the programmers, for example, will be working with everyone else for the first time.
 FryDev#0372: level design is also pretty different from mechanic design
 jermrellum#5051: i mean none of my games come out the way they were in my head
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: It all gets done side by side. Lol.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Lol
 jermrellum#5051: or how the program can be programmed without being designed
 jermrellum#5051: like I don't get how the designers can work without the program being done
 FryDev#0372: I mean, Team Bugulon is a pretty big team
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I'll let you know when it's all over. Lol.
 FryDev#0372: if you have experience with working with all the other team members, I can see how it could work well within 48 hours
 wren#0640: i think it was 24 people? in one team?
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: 2 designers (including me), 3 artists, 4 programmers, 1 musician and 1 playtester.
 wren#0640: its not even the worst team
 WhyIamHere#0329: just me
 jermrellum#5051: how do you even manage 11 people in a 48 hour
 FryDev#0372: sounds hard to manage
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Still 11. Lol.
 wren#0640: how many people are on your team at this point lmao
 wren#0640: i have me and a composer :)
 Scolon#4218: Yeah I'll be making my own pixel art as well, I've done quite a lot of it and it's finally to a level & style I'm happy with.
 wren#0640: oh thats neat actually
 jermrellum#5051: I actually did clay graphics for the last couple of years so that helped my games stand out, also not using an engine too, but yay now this year I'm doing unity so it's time to fit in
 PepperBoi#4544: I like teaming with artists cause its fun and you can get twice the work done
 FryDev#0372: I like doing all the art for my jam games myself, since I’d say I’m pretty decent at pixel art and it helps your game to stand out when there’s 20 other games with your exact idea
 Viola_Buddy#6763: I'm thinking maybe even downright old-enough-to-be-public domain stuff. Playing card designs, hanafuda card designs, chess piece designs, things like that.
 Spartiality#1145: Indeed
 FryDev#0372: this is quite exciting
 jermrellum#5051: I for the first time have a teammate this year after 5 years of jams so finally I don't have to worry about doing art at last minute
 wren#0640: both because i think im pretty ok at pixel art? and also because it sucks when theres like 5 other jam games that look identical to yours
 wren#0640: i hate using free to use art assets tbh
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: We did that for our last game jam. Probably will do something else.
 Viola_Buddy#6763: Definitely doing either that or pre-existing art. Or maybe even something like using Chinese characters as art, like in Chinese and Japanese chess
 Big Cheese#7612: in the game
 Scolon#4218: You can always go for a geometric shape based art style if you really can't be bothered with doing art
 Viola_Buddy#6763: I'm likely to do a board or card game. The animations required are simple - or, in a pinch, can be entirely non-existent
 Scolon#4218: I'm doing a roguelike but won't decide on the sub-genre until the theme is announced. Won't necessarily be action packed
 wren#0640: oughh a doom style retro fps could be sick actually
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I might do FPS or platformer.
 wren#0640: im definitely thinking a top down puzzler unless i get a really good idea for another genre
 Scolon#4218: I haven't touched grass in about 9 months
 Pixstatic#3464: grass is great, touch it sometime
 wren#0640: bc puzzle games are simple code-wise generally and absolutely slap if you do good puzzle design
 Big Cheese#7612: grass is a deal breaker in my book
 Scolon#4218: Now I see why you're called big cheese
 Big Cheese#7612: clark ken-t
 Henry_Hamster#4240: I actually never like to make puzzle games my first thought because I'm scared of making too easy puzzles...
 Big Cheese#7612: whats barbie's favorite superhero?
 Scolon#4218: RTS would be difficult to pull off in only 48 hours, that genre alone is quite an overscope
 SlingingPlant145#5532: For some reason I keep wanting to make a RTS/TBS game, but that's probably not the best idea when there's only 48 hours and I've never made a strategy game before. *Sigh*
 Viola_Buddy#6763: "I don't know what I'm doing so I guess I'll make the players not know what they're doing either!"
 Scolon#4218: Puzzle games are probably one of the easiest you can go for in a game jam setting, so makes sense
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Yeah. Why tf is it always a puzzle game. Lol.
 SlingingPlant145#5532: Then it always ends up as a puzzle game though. :/
 Triggered#6897: Now that's more like it
 Scolon#4218: I prefer the term: "Professional Activity Delayer"
 Triggered#6897: Procastination
 Scolon#4218: Guys remember if you get stuck just start making the first thing that comes to mind
 Henry_Hamster#4240: Itll help with the vibes
 ThatIsANoNoWord#5311: I haven’t been in a game jam for a while. Hopefully I can do well this time around
 TheGameShePlays#7762: I changed my room round a bit and put up my new strip lights (actually good ones, not the cheap broken ones I had before). I don't think it'll help much with the jam but at least it looks good 😅
 SlappyGrandPappy#5862: i just dont know if im competitive. guess ill find out. the person i was gonna work with couldnt
 Scolon#4218: This chat also gets super active like 1-3 hours pre-jam
 SlappyGrandPappy#5862: probably
 Nikewade#0336: Ahh right, plastic SCM is the one yea.
 Scolon#4218: There probably going to be a lot of people looking for last minute teams in a bit
 SlappyGrandPappy#5862: welp here goes... my team finder is out there... stressed as hell rn
 Lawn#1538: The trend here seems to be GitHub or GitLab. There’s Plastic SCM, but I’ve heard mixed opinions.
 Nikewade#0336: Yea, altho I think it is the same for git in general unsure. Pretty sure it is just my lack of knowledge on using Git
 jermrellum#5051: using collab?
 Nikewade#0336: Yea for sure, I mainly mean the logistics of merging files and such, in Unity. Last time we had a ton of problems with things breaking and merging wrong.
 jermrellum#5051: I think it's hard with a game jam so short to have organization, but if one person is lead they could assign tasks they don't want to do to other programmers -- ie, "ugh, i dont feel like working on the camera script, neil can go do that"
 SeanSS#0892: Also off topic here, but I heard a lot of shady stuff is going down at unity, and Im kind of worried
 Nikewade#0336: But from what I understand now, it is best to work on separate scenes? Anyone have any knowledge on this?
 Nikewade#0336: I am also having trouble exactly understanding how to manage workflow with a team.. aka, what to work on and when. Last time when I worked with a team, we all worked on one scene which went very bad, there were multiple overwrites and such
 Nikewade#0336: Yea, altho when I used it last time it has a lot of cons
 jermrellum#5051: is it like git without being annoying
 Nikewade#0336: Unity Teams or whatever, allows you to work on a project with a team
 jermrellum#5051: what is the unity built in collaborate?
 Nikewade#0336: To elaborate tho, are most people using the Unity built in collaborate or?
 Dabt#7840: anyway im going to bed now, jam starts at 6pm tomorow so i will either be dead or full of energy
 jermrellum#5051: "When the mind does nothing, the brain stirs..." ~ John Wilkes Booth
 Dabt#7840: not thinking, just doing nothing
 jermrellum#5051: that's the responsible thing really, gotta think it out, I usually fall asleep right after hearing the theme and wake up 3 hours later
 Scolon#4218: I am ready
 Dabt#7840: and dreams if there are any remaining
 Nikewade#0336: lol
 Dabt#7840: hope
 Nikewade#0336: What is everyone using to work with a team? Mostly asking for Unity ^^
 Dabt#7840: its a tie, they are both dead
 tykenn#8548: Who would win: the Reassurance Bucket or the Weighted Companion Cube?
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Well, it should be happy that I got the Broom Closet ending first! XD
 Lawn#1538: I’m just glad it’s not what I thought it was going to be.
 SeanSS#0892: The broom closet is displeased about this one
 Dabt#7840: not like it matters to me, imma stare at an empty project for 4h without doing anything like usual
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: It has a sticker that says "Property of Stanly" on it
 Triggered#6897: Right on time
 Dabt#7840: do we get the theme right as it starts or a few minutes early, ik some jams that are short that give themes a few minutes early for thinking time
 Lawn#1538: I’m watching this intently.
 SeanSS#0892: *no*
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: There's more...
 Dabt#7840: im just gonna wing it
 wren#0640: ive got everything set up to ddos the itch.io servers as soon as the jam timer hits 0 i think im ready
 SeanSS#0892: *dear god*
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Ho yes, I also have a BUCKET
 SlothHugger-v2.0#3202: lol, and i thought, 8 redbulls in stock will be enough... clearly im not prepared
 Lawn#1538: iirc his team is himself, but his network is huge.
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: I'm currently getting my setup ready, Cleaning off my desk, setting up my equipment for live streaming, got my schedule made, I've bought snacks, got some refreshments at the ready, a button that blows up half of Kentucky... Wait, how did that get here??
 ChichoRD#0598: It makes sense that he receives help from the community but some game jams are not as big as one might think. He could just be there at his computer at home and think all of a sudden about a theme and use the tools itch io provides to manage the jam
 ChichoRD#0598: MARKTRIX
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: 😶
 Triggered#6897: MATRIX
 Big Cheese#7612: Mark Mk II
 Lawn#1538: What if I told you, the mods and mod helpers are all Marks.
 ChichoRD#0598: Oh, but he has a team/friends that organise this event, that's what I wanted to point
 wren#0640: gmtk really does not strike me as the type of jam to do that though
 Big Cheese#7612: touch screen laptop
 Lawn#1538: Someone I’m not at liberty to disclose.
 Dabt#7840: some jams just have a pool and use a random number generator to get  a random theme
 ChichoRD#0598: A keyboard
 Big Cheese#7612: a computer
 wren#0640: i imagine they have 1 theme they decide on a good while in advance
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: (Because of time zone differences.)
 ChichoRD#0598: Whom with does Mark decide the game theme?
 Dabt#7840: the chances of it being any theme we are saying here is basically none, and they might just skip that theme because we said it here lol
 SeanSS#0892: Im not ready in the slightest
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Same here. All 11 of us are set up and we got some packages installed already like pro builder and stuff. Trello, Github, Google Docs, Unity... all systems go and awaiting Theme Drop.
 wren#0640: its never explicit so probably not?
 ChichoRD#0598: Would the little dragon game "Deepest sword" be considered NSFW for this kind of event? I think it's an awesome idea well executed
 Dabt#7840: just gonna make a walking simulator that is 100gb
 ConstantDerivative#6302: im just going to keep the discord window and youtube window open at the same time
 Lawn#1538: This place will absolutely go off when the theme is announced.
 ConstantDerivative#6302: oh okay
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: The idea makes me happy that there is rules against NSFW stuff
 ADEEL#5105: Big games are greater in size?
 ChichoRD#0598: Oh, ok
 Lawn#1538: Please keep speculation of the theme in 
 jermrellum#5051: I hope the theme is "comedy game" so I can play a bunch of bad ragdoll physics games
 Lawn#1538: As Blaziken said yesterday, you are going to have to go out of your way to purposefully miss the start of the jam. Keep an eye on the chat, or just leave the premiere on YouTube open.
 ChichoRD#0598: Interesting theme tho 🤔
 ChichoRD#0598: My little brother said that he would like the theme to be "big things" as he likes to play big games
 ConstantDerivative#6302: wait when exactly does Mark usually ping everyone before the jam
 Lawn#1538: What are some tools you lot can’t live without for the jam?
 Big Cheese#7612: went into flow state?
 jermrellum#5051: well yeah, my teammate made up a theme "to flow" and then I rolled with it
 Lawn#1538: I’ve loaded a new Unity project with all the tools I’m using and set up my game’s folder hierarchy, but not actually made a game. There’s no point without the theme tbh.
 jermrellum#5051: I really didn't have much experience with unity so it helped to learn about all the annoying nullreferenceexceptions I'm going to have to deal with
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Nah. We probably should've, huh?
 jermrellum#5051: anyone else spend the last 48 hours making a test game to prepare for the jam and now are afraid their test game will be better than their actual?
 Big Cheese#7612: hi
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Bye 🧀
 Scolon#4218: hi 🧀
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I can't wait to see what everyone makes!!
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: I know, right!
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: HI MILKSHAKE!
 ZEST#7932: Bruh
 Kira#7896: 👋
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: **HI KIRA!!**
 Kira#7896: I think the free version lets you develop but not export builds. If you have teammates using it, you could get away with not buying the license. But, you should go check. I'm not totally sure how it works now.
 Sherbert Lemon#8177: dm?
 Cearáj#9556: godo
 Cearáj#9556: go
 iceberglettuce#4394: lol true
 iceberglettuce#4394: yea its not too bad i was just wondering since they had one last time
 Pixstatic#3464: the sole advantage of the awful subscription model
 Pixstatic#3464: I mean you can just license it for a month for like $10 or whatever
 ZEST#7932: Free Pixel artist here 😁
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Sek sea
 iceberglettuce#4394: Or am I gonna need to buy one lol
 iceberglettuce#4394: For the last couple jams there have been free temporary gamemaker licenses available, is there anything like that this time?
 Catfish#2063: I am s**y and ik it
 Big Cheese#7612: 🤢
🐽
💋
 CALSYTHE#6648: is anyone spreading jam?
 redve#6507: Thanks
 Jeker#3389: Not saying its bad btw
 redve#6507: Yes, yes it is
 Jeker#3389: Thats a pretty standard interptetaion
 redve#6507: Gn too
 Catfish#2063: Anyway am just gonna sleep gn
 Catfish#2063: This too👁️👄👁️
 redve#6507: 👉 😸  👈
 Catfish#2063: I need to save that
 Catfish#2063: That's Smart actually
 Catfish#2063: They way I made this is by making a kinematic class (basically a moving sprite with a rect) and a collide array
Having the tiles and enemies
 redve#6507: ```cpp
for i=0; i<size-1; i++
for j=i+1; j<size; j++
check_collision(block[i], block[j]
```
in that way, i think i won't check collision between the same 2 blocks in 1 frame
 Catfish#2063: But then u might check collision from the same object multiple times
 redve#6507: I have engine class, which has vector array with rectangles. I will just push the rectangles from file to that array, and then resolve collisions between units, and blocks. I can also change code a bit, so i will also resolve collisions between block and blocks if i have to
 Catfish#2063: I mean the isAbove or colliding from Below
 Catfish#2063: So how do the collision go in Ur "placeholder"
 Catfish#2063: Oh I just wanted to ask
 redve#6507: If you mean things like texture as background, then i will set is_solid property to false. By is solid i mean, if i should care about collisions with that object
 Catfish#2063: What if it's a spritesheet
 redve#6507: 99% i will be able to use rectangles as shapes for everything, i don't think i will need other shapes.
Rectangle can be described as
{x, y} for position and {w, h} for size
i want store all rectangles for each level in format like
x y w h "path to texture" is_solid
x y w h "path to texture" is_solid
x y w h "path to texture" is_solid
...
then i will read it with fstream, and push it to array of blocks for entire level.
I want do similar things with units
 Catfish#2063: Like (a) cpp/(header) tilemap
 Catfish#2063: Wdym blocks from file?
 redve#6507: I am just creating some simple engine.
Reading entities and blocks from file, playing music, and basic stuff like this.
I will try to finish it, and refactor, so it will be easy to extend / change some mechanics
 Catfish#2063: But I planned a placeholder for the gmtk, having a tiles engine/ moving player
 Catfish#2063: Ya
 Catfish#2063: So.. panicking is everywhere
 redve#6507: Did you start from scratch when theme was release?
 Catfish#2063: Thx for trying it anyways I just had a solid game theory/ logic but failed to actually do the mechanics properly it was a game jam anyway
 redve#6507: When i pressed the menu key
 Catfish#2063: After pressing next it takes u to the game credits
 redve#6507: Idk if it's a gltch, or you didn't have time to ending screen
 redve#6507: After level where you jump over 2 holes, i cannot press next
 Catfish#2063: Try without touching the wall tiles
 Catfish#2063: Nah u can
 redve#6507: I passed the game in like 2 mins lol, if it ends with doors you cant get through
 redve#6507: Kinda short, but doesn't look bad
 Catfish#2063: Ye that's the idea otherwise it would have been easier
 redve#6507: Not in the place where you used q
 redve#6507: But then you start on a level beginning
 Catfish#2063: Press Q
 redve#6507: You can fly as ghost when you k**l yourself with e (yes, i had to censor that word)
 Catfish#2063: In the game?
 Catfish#2063: Ghost?
 redve#6507: How to stop being ghost?
 Catfish#2063: However it was made in js
 redve#6507: And you will compress final file into zip, which will also make it lighter, so i think i will fit with wav audio files in 1gb
 redve#6507: If you compose it with jpg compression, you shouldn't get much worse graphics, with really light textures
 redve#6507: Yeah, but look for a graphics in games which won previous game jams. Basically, most of it was composed out of really small rectangles, in pixelart style, with basic resolution like 10x10, 20x20
 Catfish#2063: Oh
 Catfish#2063: Thus loosing resolution (blurry)
 redve#6507: There was a game under 13kb, which was storing levels in small png pictures
 redve#6507: I didn't have to think too much about it. I just realized that i can create graphics in 10x10 resolution, and then stretch it
 Catfish#2063: Isn't that alot for a game-jam game
 redve#6507: I think i will stick to wav rn. I managed to create really light textures, so i have some space left out of 1gb
 Catfish#2063: And didn't try ever since just transferred to coding directly to js
 Catfish#2063: Nope last time I tried it blew up a couple of thousand js lines
 Catfish#2063: Also the images + me too gn frnd
 redve#6507: Wait, you managed to play mp3 files?
 Catfish#2063: Ohhh now I remember something like that
 redve#6507: I am too angry rn to go sleep, so i will finish some basic collisions and reading levels from file
 Catfish#2063: U have to MIXER_INT
 redve#6507: Maybe you need flag like SDL2_IMAGE_FORMATS in example, but for mixer
 Catfish#2063: I will try my luck tomorrow with it
 BricksParts#5032: "So long, gay mario!" *yeet* - Bowser 2022
 redve#6507: I just replaced sound files in resource folder. Mp3 just don't play for some reason in my case
 Catfish#2063: Maybe something is wrong in the code? Like a forgotten intialization?
 redve#6507: Oh, that's what you mean
 Catfish#2063: I usually tend to use mp3 or ogg
 Catfish#2063: Tbh wav files are so huge
 Professor Pickles#8498: sup broskis
 redve#6507: What are you looking for? I sent you working example. I got my code to work, so i can try to help you
 Catfish#2063: Good luck I will ping u if I found anything
 redve#6507: Np, but i am gonna stab authors of emscripten and sdl_mixer for those docs
 Catfish#2063: Thx m8 thats lots of help
 Scolon#4218: Oh yeah I need to setup a trello for this
 Lyfe#8258: oh if you want things to do before the jam starts you should probably set up a trello or github projects page, because kanban boards are useful
 Ldweller#3060: 👋 would love to join but away from home & laptop this weekend sonhere for moral support! Good luck y'all
 redve#6507: You need to have .wav files, mp3 breaks for some reason
 DrNukeLear#2414: Good thing you remembered. If you were late you could have been stuck with the marmalade.
 JuliusCube#8501: i just realized, its less than a day till the jam
 Catfish#2063: I will research might find an English copy
 Catfish#2063: That's awesome actually
 Jeker#3389: Its actually pretty recent, releasing on 2020
 Catfish#2063: Note: this is my first time hearing Ur books name
 Catfish#2063: Yee nice ig it's a 1900s book, author focused on such things then, honestly reminds me of the man in the iron mask
 Jeker#3389: Yeah
 Catfish#2063: The prison?
 Jeker#3389: "Ο Εθελοντης" focuses on a survivor of Ausvitch from Athens
 Catfish#2063: Ye pretty similar
 Catfish#2063: Or Asian ese/Korean
 Jeker#3389: Oh I also speak a bit of German
 Catfish#2063: Friend that is so cool looking forward to learning it except it's harder than german
 Jeker#3389: Greece is the country, Greek is the nationality/language
 Jeker#3389: Yeah i am from Greece
 RiverDog#8199: gratze
 Fraserfatt#1021: Audio Listener on the camera, audio source on whatever needs to *make* the noise. By default, scenes have a listener component already attached to the Main Camera object
 Catfish#2063: Wait how? Do u speak Greece?
 Jeker#3389: They are in Greek so yeah
 Catfish#2063: Names?
 Jeker#3389: Most of the books i have focus on general europe history
 Catfish#2063: Ah
 Jeker#3389: Oh, not from a book just articles online
 RiverDog#8199: wikipedia
 Catfish#2063: What book
 Jeker#3389: Anyways, i am reading about modern greek/balkan history, its pretty cool
 Catfish#2063: Same
 RiverDog#8199: lol mr Monster.
audio source component
 awsumturtle#2957: Audio Source
 Jeker#3389: I want to use all 48 hours
 RiverDog#8199: i need to figure out attaching music in unity, its to the camera you probably just add a componet
 Catfish#2063: Yes I need to know this too
 redve#6507: How to compile game written in SDL2 to wasm with emscripten, and play sounds with SDL2_mixer? I've compile 2 .cpp files with
```
emcc src/main.cpp src/Engine/Engine.cpp src/AudioPlayer/AudioPlayer.cpp -s USE_SDL=2 -s LLD_REPORT_UNDEFINED -o output/test.html -s USE_SDL_MIXER=2 --preload-file resources/music/output.mp3
```
but it doesn't play music for some reason
 Catfish#2063: Nice
 Catfish#2063: Pygame
 RiverDog#8199: I am just keeping it as simple as possible, and unity gave away free tutorials during 2020 spring and i did my first jam doing the art for pygame*  My teammate was cool and we had a cool idea
 Lyfe#8258: the answer is yes btw so thats good to know
 Catfish#2063: I am still panicking not sure of what I should use to create the game
 RiverDog#8199: ha thats awesome.  thats really cool helping out the schools like that
 Zayed#7379: Idk its my first time so do U have to set up one
 Lyfe#8258: save time by doing it before the jam starts
 tcvm#0019: It's developing a 360 tool for teachers to make interactable 360 video content, fun stuff tbh. the reason i wouldnt use unity is because, as my job has shown me, unity and i dont vibe
 Viola_Buddy#6763: I also expect to need more time than I expect. What's that law called, things always take longer than you expect, even when you account for this effect?
 Zayed#7379: Why would u need to set up one
 wren#0640: iirc yeah
 Lyfe#8258: wait is it possible to set an itch io page up for the game without the jam having started, and then change it after it starts to be a jam entry
 Viola_Buddy#6763: I have no idea. This is kind of what I'm expecting.
 Zayed#7379: I had web dev experience before being game dev too
since its a lil bit easier
 tcvm#0019: ironically my job is in unity right now
 RiverDog#8199: thats crazy, u must be web dev
 RiverDog#8199: or GOS? somethinf like that is supposed to be simpler
 tcvm#0019: this is going to be my first time using an engine lol, ive only ever worked in opengl
 Zayed#7379: Same I guess
 RiverDog#8199: the reason is probably because most of us know c# from day jobs
 Tob#1798: yea I find it to be very simple and easy too find what i need
 Zayed#7379: obviously, I used Godot before but now am Using Unity
 tcvm#0019: pretty easy game engines to get into
 JuliusCube#8501: basically everyone here works on either unity or godot for some reason, its good to have some variety
 Zayed#7379: Cool
rarely found someone who uses that
 Tob#1798: ah I work on gms2
 Zayed#7379: Unity
Am an Android Game Dev
 Tob#1798: what do you work on?
 Zayed#7379: I do need someone who is good with ideas though
I mean I can come up with unique mechanics and ideas for games
but still would be nice to have a partner
 Zayed#7379: same
 Tob#1798: yea
 RiverDog#8199: is this your first jam?
 Tob#1798: I think I could make something simple in like 8-10 hours, idk tho
 RiverDog#8199: But playing with importing sprites, making tilemaps, and detecting 2d collisions means that i will be able to make a level.  I need to learn to make multiple scenes and my test was in 16 bit not 8 bit which ill try to use with a limited pallet
 RiverDog#8199: I think i will spend 4-6 hours, and ignorantly will spend 12 hours trying to just finish it
 RiverDog#8199: Poll the Audience:  How many hours are you planning to spend, and do you think you will be on time, over, under?
 terrysaw#9401: I know that feeling well, too
 Cunnah#9270:  I forget what I am doing as soon as I go through the next door. Apparently my productivity would increase with open plan living
 terrysaw#9401: I am glad you said that. That always happens to me but I never remember to have a notepad and hate typing on my phones, so a lot of ideas are lost
 Snickerzilla#4948: :o
 Tob#1798: 👍
 Tob#1798: yes
 Cunnah#9270: good night
 Cunnah#9270: I would suggest you have a notepad handy when your taking a break its amazing how often a solution comes when your not thinking about the problem
 terrysaw#9401: Sleep well, friend!
 Tob#1798: na it didnt come across that way, I once tried to stay up really late and program and I couldnt think about a single thing clearly so ill be trying to stay healthy with my sleep
 Cunnah#9270: 500 MB thats a fancy UE5 logo 😉
 lower third#3333: but just empty UE5 project build is 500 MB not pog
 lower third#3333: created the script to automatically package and upload game to itch, also desktop itch application automatically updates game to latest build pog
 Cunnah#9270:  nah its fine. That sounded like a wierd flex. What I meant is I find most of game design is spent on making mistakes and then correcting those mistakes. So rest more make less mistakes get more done. 🙂
 Tob#1798: oof hope it isnt too bad
 Cunnah#9270: I am sure your going to do ok 🙂
 Cunnah#9270: I have chronic fatigue so I am seriously going to have to pace myself but I think I can get something out there.
 Scolon#4218: Overscoping is a huge problem during jams ye
 Tob#1798: good advice guys thanks
 Cunnah#9270: Tob my advice is to rest when you can, it is amazing how you can do the same amount better when your well rested. So don't push yourself to hard
 Hederlunden#3231: just cut down on content if you are running really low on time
 Tob#1798: thanks!
 Tob#1798: yea but ill be beating my self up if I dont hit the deadline
 Cunnah#9270: This is my second game jam, doing it solo just to see if I can.
 Jeker#3389: Theres really no failing if you submit
 terrysaw#9401: Thx!
 Hederlunden#3231: you wont fail
 terrysaw#9401: That is my plan as well. I will do the best I can as I have nothing to lose other than a weekend, which I often waste doing things I don't like anyway.
 Jeker#3389: WOOOO! Go get them!
 Tob#1798: this is my first gamejam and im trying to solo it so ill probably fail but it will be a good learning experience
 golds#3845: same to you :)
 terrysaw#9401: Thank you everybody for being so kind. I wish you all luck for tomorrow!
 UrbanNinja#4421: Thanks
 terrysaw#9401: Thank you for the advice! (I want to thank everybody but it is difficult in slow mode). I would like to increase my skills all around as I'd like to be a solo dev, but I will definitely practice more.
 Tyrix#6647: one person of the team submits and puts all other teammembers as ... i think it wes called maintainers ... on itch
 terrysaw#9401: obviously the point is to not make anything ahead of time, but I am talking about things not necessarily directly related to the game
 Tyrix#6647: for a jam, concentrate on what helps the player understand the game. highlight things the player *needs* to see, and keep everything else simple.
out of jams: just do it more. without practice you won't get better.
But also remember you don't have to be good at everything. Maybe it is worth finding something you are good at and working in a teams with people who are good in other areas. At least for the future
 terrysaw#9401: I hope I am not derailing any conversations or asking too many questions (or even if this is the right channel for them), but does anybody more experienced with jams have any tips for what I can/should be doing now to prepare?
 golds#3845: I think they just submit the itch.io page, no idea tho since this is my first time
 Snickerzilla#4948: How long does it usually take for people to contact you about a post? xd
 UrbanNinja#4421: i know this has probs been answered beofre so sorry for being dumb but how do teams submit?
 golds#3845: Same execpt unity
 RocketCow#5210: do it, fail, fail quickly and miserably. Not the most pleasant experience, but it'll learn ya 😄
 terrysaw#9401: Thanks for all the support and kind words 🙂
 Tyrix#6647: they do, as long as you keep scope creep in check
 terrysaw#9401: Any tips on how to maximize learning in areas I am not as good at such as art and sound?
 Peter#0007: good luck  ! i believe in ya
 Maikha#4246: hell yeah , fellow godoter!
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: jams can indeed help! the only two projects i finished were jams!
 terrysaw#9401: Thanks!
 RocketCow#5210: Good luck and have fun!
 terrysaw#9401: Hi everybody! This is going to be my first ever game jam. I love making games and have found myself very comfortable in Godot, but find it difficult to finish anything. Everybody says game jams can help. Hope it does
 golds#3845: I am a witness now
 Peter#0007: 🚨 you just got busted, controller down and discord notifications muted please
 RocketCow#5210: Frick
 Peter#0007: "Standalone is very doable with source SDK  (metroidbrainia fan)
and from what I understand, not being a lawyer, "modding the game" does involve using the assets provided, meaning that you may distribute them "through steam, via your own website or any third-party service without getting a seperate license" " -  oops too late sorry
 RocketCow#5210: obviously don't quote me on this
 Peter#0007: ooooh! that's really neat, thanks for sharing!
 golds#3845: whiteboard for me :)
 Jeker#3389: Now visualizing them...i have the artistic skills of a french fry
 RocketCow#5210: Standalone is very doable with source SDK 
and from *what I understand,* not being a lawyer, "modding the game" does involve using the assets provided, meaning that you may distribute them "through steam, via your own website or any third-party service without getting a seperate license" 
 Jeker#3389: I mostly use paper for writting ideas out
 ghost 1#4387: lol
 marcorioz#7340: so real
 Peter#0007: false, game devs do not plan. game devs tighten up the graphics on level 3
 redka#6365: there's a game in there somewhere
 golds#3845: fantasitc
 golds#3845: could you use assets though? like from HL2?
 Peter#0007: still the standalone problem though no?
 RocketCow#5210: actually, so long as you don#t ask for money directly, a half life  mod *would* be fine, considering valve's licensing documentation:
```
Non-commercial
By non-commercial we mean that anyone who owns the Valve-developed base game may download and play the mod without having to pay for it.
It is ok for a mod team to accept donations from its users so long as the access to the mod or features thereof is not dependent on making a donation.
Including paid advertising in your mod makes it commercial.
Based on the Official SDK
We supply SDKs with many of our games. These are the approved basis for modding our games. It is not ok to ship a mod that is based on leaked or stolen source code.
As long as you follow these guidelines you may freely distribute your mod through Steam, via your own website or any third-party service without getting a separate license from Valve.
```
 GavRaz#6261: godot cool cus it reminds me of my origins, roblox
 golds#3845: yeah I think I am gunna use unity until the near future and research other engines, idk Unity is what I started with so I guess I am a bit attached
 macleodian#7269: Just make half life 2 from scratch then mod it
 Fraserfatt#1021: ^
 Jaixden#7480: Defo dont use unreal for a jam tho. You have to argue with it for 12 hours to get basic shit working
 Fraserfatt#1021: you'll be fine for the near future. Though, if you're going into game dev, it doesn't hurt to know some more engine environments
 warriormaster#2392: Most of the concepts are the same in other engines, just might have different terminologies. Unreal, Godot, Game Maker, CryEngine, Open3D etc.
 Peter#0007: ofc that wouldn't work for the jam sadly 😭
 Peter#0007: never too late to release a half-life 2 mod
 Dagi#2077: 😰😰😰
 golds#3845: Dang this unity stuff is messed up, I just don't know any other engine like Unity plus there is so many reasources/tutorials for it
 warriormaster#2392: Me too, I'm hoping to try and make a game with Godot 4
 Tob#1798: hahaha
 Hederlunden#3231: not in 48 hours
 Peter#0007: talk about mixed messages
 Hederlunden#3231: i want to do that but it's risky since i've never done it before
 Tob#1798: lol np😂
 Mimic#7884: ok quick tip, if ur using webgl try uploading a private build to itch.io testing it, i just spent an hour trying to upload something and would have probably missed the deadline if i hadn't
 Peter#0007: thank you!!! 😅
 chillvibes#1248: I’m looking forward to it
 Peter#0007: OH MY GOD
 warriormaster#2392: Challenge accepted
 Tob#1798: *sleep is absolutely important, please do put your health and wellbeing above a game jam.
 Peter#0007: somebody do a 1d game
 IamHaPPy#2536: thats a giga chad
 chillvibes#1248: pov: u are that one alpha that attempts to make a 3d game and actually submits it on time
 Peter#0007: sleep is absolutely important, please put your health or wellbeing above a game jam. besides, we make crap work on no sleep
 IamHaPPy#2536: sleep and relaxation < fun in the gmtk jam
 GavRaz#6261: im using godot from the getgo
 RajOTS#4331: Hi. haven't had much success on  if anyone or team is looking for Unity programmer send me a message.
 Snickerzilla#4948: Just did yeahhh wooo B)
 Ernani#0976: Hello
 Ahat#0842: yo ur a composer?
 Snickerzilla#4948: And and, the fact the composer and sound designer tag are the same tag makes it super confusing on what people need
 Snickerzilla#4948: It takes too long for a response and people already say they get a lot of composers trying to join their team D:
 R2D2Vader#0693: if you stick a  post on the team website ^^^
 Hederlunden#3231: then you will easily find a team
 Nobody6502#8971: man I would think those would be high demand
 Snickerzilla#4948: cOmposer
 R2D2Vader#0693: D:
 Nobody6502#8971: What role are you looking to fill?
 Snickerzilla#4948: I honestly kinda work better when I'm tired af so that's not baaad B))
 Hederlunden#3231: and you get to have a little fun, and be really stressed and sleep deprived!
 Snickerzilla#4948: I've been bored this whole summer, this surely will be interesting if ~~if i find a team that is~~ :'D
 Hederlunden#3231: yeah its hell, but hey, you have a tiny chance to win
 Snickerzilla#4948: Good god 😭
 R2D2Vader#0693: i'm planning to sleep two full nights over the two day period 👀
 IceyMations#9584: im gonna sleep dont worry
 RocketCow#5210: *sleep* people. Whatever hours you get out of staying awake you will lose because your brain shuts down.
 Viola_Buddy#6763: I think the only thing *expressly* forbidden is any code or designwork written specifically for this jam. Everything else is generally "sort-of-kind-of-try to keep to the spirit of 'developing' the game over the 48 hours"
 R2D2Vader#0693: 1 hour sleep in all that time D:
 Hederlunden#3231: - sleep = 47 hours
 Hederlunden#3231: 48 hours
 Snickerzilla#4948: How long usually is the game jam?
 Ollieboy#2670: Generally boilerplate code is fine for jams. This is from the jam page: `What assets can I use? The game should be developed during the jam, but you may use pre-existing code and can use whatever art and audio assets you have the legal right to use.`
 Ahat#0842: we are allowed to use player controllers pre made before the jam right?
 M1K3_dev#0111: woah... bad stuff, over 200 employees?
 asciiboi06#0001: Go godot. it is an amazing engine.
 asciiboi06#0001: IronSource. that explains it
 R2D2Vader#0693: lets go gms2
 DrNukeLear#2414: Which company?
 M1K3_dev#0111: ~~pog~~
 R2D2Vader#0693: oo how shady
 asciiboi06#0001: Unity aquired a shady company.
 R2D2Vader#0693: what recent things? fill me in
 asciiboi06#0001: How many ppl are using switching from unity to godot this gamejam because of the recent things that have been happening?
 lower third#3333: I can dm it
 neilmakesgames#0452: That's interesting! Do you have any public version I can read?
 lower third#3333: based
 Scolon#4218: Yeah I just wrote a simple editor script in unity that automatically deploys the build to the itch page
That's all I really need
 lower third#3333: for gamejams even just having a script in the build output folder to package and upload the build is good enough lol, you are not saving that much time by automating builds and adding a post build script especially if you want to test before uploading
 SaadTheGlad#9716: My French is very broken
 Scolon#4218: The standalone builds would work as expected though
 Scolon#4218: I don't have automatic builds on commit because for some reason the webgl build that github created was not the same as the one I do locally. It was smaller and would crash on startup on itch.io. I think it was compressing it for some reason.
 lower third#3333: CD and even more CI are really unheard of in gamedev and really behind even in AAA, did my BSc thesis about this lol
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: We're no strangers to love. You know the rules and so do I. 
 SaadTheGlad#9716: Bien siur
 b1n4ry#5112: чё
 RocketCow#5210: Auch dir.
 SaadTheGlad#9716: Oui?
 neilmakesgames#0452: I'm no stranger to butler and the cli, just curious about everyone else :D
 Scolon#4218: With butler it was pretty easy to setup quickly building/deploying to itch
 LurkNautili#3246: Didn't even occur to me as an option to automate that... but for any real project I suppose I would
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Tu tambien
 LurkNautili#3246: I was just gonna manually upload new builds
 SaadTheGlad#9716: udeux
 lower third#3333: but im on UE5 for this jam so no idea how to hook that in
 lower third#3333: if u build from commandline its pretty basic to script with butler
 neilmakesgames#0452: Anyone use or plan to use continuous deployment for their builds to automatically push to itch when you commit? (I'm debating)
 IceyMations#9584: u3
 R2D2Vader#0693: u3
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: u2
 Tob#1798: u2
 lower third#3333: u2
 Delphine Noel#1196: Good luck bros
 Tob#1798: lol
 Delphine Noel#1196: so anyway
 PotatoNato#6377: alpha, as cool as godot 4 is, I wouldn’t recommend using it yet unless your actively helping out with the source code
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Maybe I can use assembly definitions so it doesn't compile all the URP stuff? I'll look into it. Its a really small game though, just a prototype for now
 lower third#3333: also maybe look into Assembly Definitions before the jam, for bigger projects they are a major improvement
 wren#0640: godot 4 is in alpha iirc
 Delphine Noel#1196: I think there was a beta or something
 Delphine Noel#1196: you'll know about other engines, it's nice to know about other options as well
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: WAIT GODOT 4 IS RELEASED ???
 Delphine Noel#1196: I'm not using godot 4 either
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: why?
 Delphine Noel#1196: nice
 lower third#3333: at the very least you could disable compiling script changes in play mode
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: Godot 3.4.3
 Delphine Noel#1196: why don't you try to learn a new game engine for the jam
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: *me who say it 5 time*
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: anyone know how to speed up compile times with unity? It really slows my progress when having to wait to make a new script
 Delphine Noel#1196: I'm also learning gdevelop now because I like the approach
 IceyMations#9584: yes i very do
 Tob#1798: nice
 Delphine Noel#1196: Godot
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: so you love terraria ?
 lower third#3333: this is all stuff that is easy to scale and cut, rather than game mechanics which have a huge upfront time investment to implement
 Delphine Noel#1196: I hope  the theme will be simple and not too complex or I will l waste most of my time on thinking of a game idea
 Tob#1798: idk if you already said or not but what game engine are you using?
 IceyMations#9584: i love 2d pixel games for some odd reason lol
 lower third#3333: I think you can still find cool things to get excited about even in these simpler to execute ideas like environment details or adding some basic text prompts to tell a story and some cool sound design
 lower third#3333: but try to make something as small as possible with little moving parts, like a walking sim with a basic fps controller for 3D or a top down pixel art game with no platforming or enemies for 2D
 lower third#3333: yep, for your first jam even putting anything out there is a big win. It helps to be on others teams first
 Delphine Noel#1196: It's kind of hard when half of the things I have never done before
 Tob#1798: good advice
 lower third#3333: you need to learn to keep track of how you are doing and what you can actually make vs what you want to be able to make
 lower third#3333: but definitely expect to cut about 70% of whatever your main idea is at the start
 Tob#1798: lol wow
 lower third#3333: I have done this before, you just learn from it as much as you can, analyze what took the longest and try to be more realistic the next time
 Fredison#9375: If you finish your tiny-scope game quickly, then you can worry about polishing and adding cool bells and whistles in the time remaining
 Delphine Noel#1196: my first game jam was brackey's but I'm proud of that one even with tons of bugs because I didn't even know what a game engine is at that time
 Fredison#9375: That's a fair worry to have-- In my experience it's a good reflex to plan the game with as small a scope as possible to try and avoid that
 lower third#3333: we credit everyone in the description anyway
 z_richman#7356: Same here. I'm the director and have the most followers, but wanna keep everyone happy too
 IamHaPPy#2536: hey wonderful jammers
 lower third#3333: as long as everyone on the team is comfortable with it, not sure what a true equal distribution of credit looks like
 Tob#1798: same, this is my first gamejam ever....
 Intikus#1375: I'm not gonna be able to join the game jam 😔
Gonna go on a trip EXACTLY on the weekend that the jam starts. Such a fucking shame, I really wanted to make a cool song this time :(
 Hederlunden#3231: you will, even if it has a lot of bugs.
 PotatoNato#6377: at least you’ll have the experience I suppose
 lower third#3333: hmm can't comment, I usually come up with the idea and end up leading the team so it makes sense to have it on my profile
 Tyrix#6647: it definately does
 Delphine Noel#1196: I'm mostly afraid like, what I join the jam and couldn't even finish my game in time
 Tyrix#6647: i do not care much and so it is usually random who gets to upload. i have never created an extra account
 z_richman#7356:  
We've done this in the past but some people are worried it still gives the one creator more of a spotlight.
 PotatoNato#6377: good, you?
 Hederlunden#3231: don't worry, my last gmtk game was shit, and the ludum dare one was..... yeah
 lower third#3333: this makes the game appear on others profiles if you add them and lists them in the game details as creators
 lower third#3333: itch.io -> edit game -> more -> game admins
 Tob#1798: my main disappointment with gms2 is I can't figure out how to get cartoony smooth art
 Delphine Noel#1196: Hi How are you 
 IceyMations#9584: same
 r3sgame#1793: itch has an admin system where you can add multiple creators
 Delphine Noel#1196: I have always been scared to join gmtk jam because of how big it is and I'm pretty bad at making games but I will finally join this time
 z_richman#7356: Hey all! Quick question. For those who are creating a team of devs that don't have an official team name, are you going to submit your GMTK game on the account of one of your team members? Or are you creating a fresh new account for the jam? We want to make it fair for everyone, but don't want to lose out on our followers being notified. Thoughts?
 TheChronicPhenix#1205: Yeeeep
 Fredison#9375: I hear you there
 PotatoNato#6377: Hello!
 lower third#3333: the only scary thing is i have to throw away my gigantic toolbox of unity tricks
 IceyMations#9584: construct is a very simple engine, coding is rare in it
 Fredison#9375: So I hear! But I'd rather not do a live fire test with it so to speak, haha, for this weekend I'll stick to what I know and experiment in other ways
 Delphine Noel#1196: Hello everyone
 PotatoNato#6377: does anyone know what c# on godot is like?
 lower third#3333: I used unity for 6 years but Godot just seems better for 2D and Unreal better for 3D
 TheChronicPhenix#1205: I'd really rather not learn a new engine, but, at this rate, looking liked Unreal is my best bet, maybe godot as it's been making great strides
 PotatoNato#6377: same for me
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: godot is ez man
 Fredison#9375: Yeah, this jam will likely be my last hurrah using Unity before I start learning Godot
 lower third#3333: major bruh moment
 birdstone#3073: cough *ironsource* cough
 Tob#1798: I tried unity and unreal but gms2 is just so simple and easy once you get the hang of it
 TheChronicPhenix#1205: Unity 4 Life, well... maybe not for long on their current track record, Unity 4 a bit more
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: same,last year i use scratch for the jam,then after the jam i discoverd godot
 lower third#3333: major refresh, google some screenshots
 IceyMations#9584: unity wont work on my computer
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: the famous unity !
 Hederlunden#3231: im using good ol' unity
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: OMG,i know someone who publish a game in switch using construct 2 lol
 Peter#0007: any idea how much has changed editor-wise since ue4?
 lower third#3333: gonna be learning UE5 lol
 Tob#1798: I tried godot the other day but was overwhelmed by the nodes, ima be using gms2
 IceyMations#9584: construct 3 (yes)
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: what are u using
 Squishy Turtle#3988: He’s talking about audio
 IceyMations#9584: not me
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: Who's gonna use godot for the jam ?
 lower third#3333: trust me you are better off making a few games that don't get rated very highly and learning from your mistakes than obsessing over the rating and letting it discourage you
 Fredison#9375: There are also websites out there for some good royalty-free music, and some free music packs on itch. Just be sure to credit the artist!
 RocketCow#5210: I understand. Keep it simple then. In the first instance a lot of people react much stronger to good sound design than composition.
 Tob#1798: can I post a game I put on itch here? (it has a slightly inappropriate name but nothing bad in the game)
 Squishy Turtle#3988: I always use bfxr + audacity and get decent enough results. Only really works for a retro style though
 Hederlunden#3231: there is ai generated music websites where you just need to click a few buttons and bam, music
 JuliusCube#8501: okay true, but that doesnt stop me from wanting the rating to be as good as possible
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: What engine are you using for the jam ?
 RocketCow#5210: if you want to make your own, just do it and use it as an opportunity to get better. The final rating is, ultimately, not that important.
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: What engine are you using
 PotatoNato#6377: respectable
 Hederlunden#3231: just get audio from the internet, even tho it sucks ass
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Ye I have a nice prototype - I'll probably have to put in the gameloop first ig
 JuliusCube#8501: yes i know i just want to make my own
i dont like taking other peoples stuff
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: why not,every one do that !
 PotatoNato#6377: your allowed to use other music
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: when you have a satisfying prototype you can start making levels, i suppose you could try making it low poly to make a lot of stuff quickly?
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: i gonna make a 2D game,cuse im not very good at 3D
 JuliusCube#8501: im kinda worried about how ill make the audio for my jam game
I can do everything  except audio.
this has been a problem in past jams for me where i could do everything well and then just get a slightly subpar score because either I had no audio or very bad audio.
Ive been practicing composing music over the past few days but I still dont know If I will make any music thats actually good.
 RocketCow#5210: can I make a joke about Obama or is that too political? 😄
But yeah, the first one has some real potential for some uh... lowkey political commentary.
 GavRaz#6261: im being taught how to do github things by my jam pal lol
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: lmao
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Issue is how do I make levels for it? I can 3D model but not enough to make whole places for flying around
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: no,faster than math teacher handwritting
 Squishy Turtle#3988: He deleted that thing faster than a drone strike deletes buildings
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: im just joking dude
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Thanks dude - thats the current one I'm doing 😄
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: just kidding LOL
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: first one was pretty good! doesn’t seem very chill though :3 but i would play it
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: just checking 🙂
 Hederlunden#3231: *joke*
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: bruh
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: Hipiti Hopiti,your idea is now my property
 Tob#1798: 👍
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: sure
 Hederlunden#3231: why not
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Can I say my ideas, to see if anyone thinks they have potential?
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: yes
 Markasabrt#0334: Can u use past scripts?
 Hederlunden#3231: sure thing, ill probably post updates on social media just to promote it when it looks like a finished product, even if theres still lots of work to be done, but ill show u
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: sure man, just make sure to tell me when its out so I can see 🙂
 Hederlunden#3231: some people do i think
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: What engine while you use ?
 Hederlunden#3231: ik ik, people dont really steal ideas but ehh
 Scolon#4218: Other people might though, there's a ton of lurkers in this discord
 Hederlunden#3231: well you can make any game if you use google
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: I'm not gonna steal your idea dude, I'm just interested
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: People who crunch:No i have cofe
 Hederlunden#3231: cuz i think it has potential
 Tob#1798: I can only make games with an endless simple run, kinda like flappy bird
 Hederlunden#3231: The small one is just a rage game I got an idea of making, it is really frustrating and has kind of a cool and unique idea and the other one I don't wanna say really
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: what kinda ideas do you have?
 Hederlunden#3231: one is much smaller than the other one tho, and is just a little fun small project
 Hederlunden#3231: Yeah that kinda sucks, I like to focus on 1 but this summer I just got so many good ideas so I can't decide which one to make
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Dude I half finish a project, start a new one then come back to them sometimes. It's so annoying but i just can't finish one
 Tob#1798: ah ok thanks
 IceyMations#9584: for the next 2 days i will work harder then i ever have
 Hederlunden#3231: oh wow, respect
 Bart Moon#2749: This jam has very healthy rules, and as it focus on design part of the games while letting You use premade assets, it is much more worth it to be rested and have Your mind as close to 100% as possible, rather than putting additional hours in just pure "doing stuff"
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Haha I'm working on 4 🙂
 birdstone#3073: it's not against the rules but it's frowned upon to make things for your jam game before the jam actually starts, it's mostly just against the spirit of the jam
 Hederlunden#3231: yeah i cant really miss this either, even tho im already working on 2 projects at the same time
 IceyMations#9584: im setting my alarm for 7 am im not missing this
 Tob#1798: making objects for stuff like game exit and screen resolution before hand is ok right?
 Hederlunden#3231: ouch, welp maybe i will sleep, but I won't wake up at 11 am as usual
 GodOfPro#7302: i am used to not sleep until 2am but yea
 Bart Moon#2749: Opposite of that actually is more likely to happen, and You can damage Your health as a byproduct.
 birdstone#3073: that's what i did last year sure but i felt horrible the day after lmao i wouldn't recommend
 IceyMations#9584: i might make a yt video about the game jam
 Hederlunden#3231: yeah.. you're right.. but if you dont sleep your game might rank a little bit higher!
 r3sgame#1793: you can definitely build a scratch project for html5
 birdstone#3073: please remember basic human functions lol
 IceyMations#9584: dont worry i will
 Mark Brown#6982: Please do sleep!
 GodOfPro#7302: you need to sleep
 IceyMations#9584: great
 Hederlunden#3231: then you're all set!
 GodOfPro#7302: lol
 IceyMations#9584: im good at that
 Hederlunden#3231: the key is to not sleep
 Hederlunden#3231: 48h jams are hard
 Hederlunden#3231: gl
 philipl#0307: Also, just wanted to mengtion, if you got an intrest for music in games check out the event/stream on yt rn, don't wanna send a link but just search "Save & Sound - A Celebration of Music in Games" on yt. It very cool
 IceyMations#9584: this years game jam will be a first for me
 GodOfPro#7302: yea it would be the nice to have features
 Hederlunden#3231: probably shouldnt be your top priority in a game jam project tho lol
 GodOfPro#7302: i might just add the ability to rebind keys if i would have the time
 Hederlunden#3231: idk, im just used to the hk controls
 PotatoNato#6377: honestly I’m more comfortable with C, but ultimately do whatever you find the most comfortable to your hands
 GodOfPro#7302: i think that would be a little confusing for someone who isn't used it to it
 Juan ;)#8067: thanks dude
 Hederlunden#3231: z for jump, x for slash, c for dash
 GodOfPro#7302: arrow keys
 PotatoNato#6377: like arrow keys or WASD
 a𝓿𝓸𝓬𝓪𝓭𝓸 𝓹𝓮𝓮𝓵#4117: i would prefer shift but you could always let people change their keybindings in the menu
 PotatoNato#6377: which keys are used for movement
 GodOfPro#7302: do you guys think left shift would be better for dash or "C"
 RocketCow#5210: oh yeah, if you can make it play on itch that goes too
 BadPiggy#5202: Not too many games out there actually focus on player progression rather than character progression.....
Sad really
 R2D2Vader#0693: Or you can keep it browser based right?
 RocketCow#5210: You may use *whatever* you like, so long as you can compile it into a standard executable for modern windows.
 Juan ;)#8067: Does anyone know if I can use scratch to make the game, even if it's not a good game, I want to try
 SaadTheGlad#9716: You need pure unfiltered raw skill
 SaadTheGlad#9716: You don't rly need the mouse for a game like hk
 Scolon#4218: It's going to be quite insane
 OrangeScientist1#9375: yes
 MangoWorks#1202: tomorrow is going to be hype
 GodOfPro#7302: when i first played hollow knight i was shocked that all the binds are on the keyboard instead of left click for attack and stuff and in some time i got used to it much better than i expected
 Squishy Turtle#3988: I got a job working for a company that makes educational games. It's way different from hobby game dev
 Bart Moon#2749: Sorry for I have sinned. I sold out long time ago.
 GodOfPro#7302: yea i was more likely talking about the indie side of things solo dev that kinda stuff
 Scolon#4218: Yeah you can do that too
 Bart Moon#2749: In that sense yeah. But you can also work at a company just like any other regular job, there is much much less risk involved then.
 philipl#0307: i don't have plans to bank on indie game dev as a full time occupation. More of a hobby/interest.
 Scolon#4218: There's like no luck involved really
 Scolon#4218: Success depends on a lot of factors though
 GodOfPro#7302: releasing a game and not achieving success
 samcox08#6606: I've done 2x30 minute jams and my method is to start the timer with no assets added.
 theChief#0001: It's completely reasonable to just do it as a hobby ☺️
 Scolon#4218: Really depends on how you approach it
 Bart Moon#2749: What do You mean risky?
 kcorb#6614: A lot of people here 👋
 GodOfPro#7302: game dev looks fun but i don't think i will do it seriously as it is a lot risky in the industry specially in the indie field
 Kol^2#3744: hi all
 Scolon#4218: Prototype a few things and then start seriously developing
 Scolon#4218: I spend like 30m just throwing out literally every idea and then narrow it down from there
Which ones can be expanded the most, which ones are most unique, etc
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: **I've still got a long way on the path of understanding the runes of coding. I will walk this road no matter the cost.**
 theChief#0001: I'm not much of a planner, so just jumping in and throwing ideas at the wall works pretty well for me
 Scolon#4218: I haven't touched it yet, it looks interesting though
 theChief#0001: I've done them a bunch, and often start bigger jams with a couple of 30 min prototypes to get the ball rolling!
 M_Raven#4076: **Our magic is not for the weak-hearted like you.**
 theChief#0001: generally I play by these rules:
- have an idea before you start the timer
- open a new project in your engine before you start the timer
- use any assets you like, and _import them before you start the timer_
- don't include build times - when the timer stops, _then_ build it
 RocketCow#5210: but yeah, I will eventually have to get a good feel for the new input system like I have for the old one, but I think for this jam I'll just stick to the old one, because I don't have to *think* about what I'm doing with it.
 GodOfPro#7302: also does anyone use unity new UI stuff ? the UI Builder
 theChief#0001: Better way of doing input in unity ☺️ basically "tell me when input has changed" rather than doing "hey had the input changed yet?" every frame
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: *me staring at chat not having a clue what the hell everyone means.*
 theChief#0001: It is definitely different, yeah 😂
 theChief#0001: It really is, I did a 30 minute jam and used this - I love it. Makes much more sense to me, reduces input lag and makes controllers a BREEZE. Also local multiplayer is pretty easy with the new system
 theChief#0001: Great idea!
 Scolon#4218: There's not much time left so decide quickly
 GodOfPro#7302: i might do a test project before the jam using the new input system
 Hobusu#5033: The rules state that the game must allow keyboard and/or mouse as control options
 M_Raven#4076: Keyboard and mouse I believe is the bare minimum to be rateable (or at least highly recommended)
 theChief#0001: It's really very easy, and when you're trying it out feel free to ping me with any questions!
 davidnjihiahere#6326: I've seen some people post playdate games in other jams. Won't be surprised to see a few in the jam
 theChief#0001: All of the tutorials that I could find do it wrong, they have a bunch of stupid boilerplate stuff you don't need if you use the PlayerInput component
 davidnjihiahere#6326: I think you can
 theChief#0001: However, if you're moving by setting the rigidbody's velocity, this will work just fine! Also, if you're doing any sort of calculations based on the input, do them here so you don't have to do it every frame! E.g. you might want to calculate aim assist here ☺️
 GodOfPro#7302: thanks do you have any good tutorial video i could see aswell to understand it better ?
 distribution (David)#6861: I want to know can I submit for GMTK Game jam games with just one touch controls? (no keyboard and mouse) like mobile casual games, with one touch control
 Hobusu#5033: Depends on what type of question you have!
 theChief#0001: One caveat - the function only runs when input _changes_, so in this case you'll probably want to store the value and use it to move the player in update or FixedUpdate
 distribution (David)#6861: Hey guys! What's the channel for questions ?
 theChief#0001: the code is just ```cs
public class PlayerMoveEntity : MonoBehaviour
{
public void GetInput 
{
Vector2 input = ctx.ReadValue;
// use that input to do stuff
}
}
```
 theChief#0001: the way you're supposed to use it is like this:
- create your InputActions
- add a PlayerInput component to your object
- use the PlayerInput to send input to your scripts. I prefer the Unity Events way of doing it, here's a screenshot: 
 M_Raven#4076: **One day remains.**
 Peter#0007: ping me when you’ve got it up pls I’m super curious!!!
 theChief#0001: It's not actually that much of a pain and it provides a bunch of benefits! One mo let me dig up the screenshots
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Ello Lawn.
 Lawn#1538:  you have been summoned.
 philipl#0307: hello every1
 GodOfPro#7302: is it worth it to implement the new input system for the jam or it can be a pain
 ◈・ Altaꐟ#9999: what would you do for optimize your game for website ?
 snuffysam#2767: I mean, my issue is that I can’t export games that use Unity’s input to be playable on the web.
I assume whatever game I make will be playable on the web and. have input.
 ◈・ Altaꐟ#9999: What do you think the subject will be?
 Squishy Turtle#3988: sorry not really sure what you're looking for here. If you want test projects I remember Unity having a bunch of decent ones
 Redline#7370: I'm using the latest -0.1 version
 badass_graduate#1406: @here do you have any spare combat projects that you can share the files for? in unity
 Squishy Turtle#3988: 2020 gave me so many issues last year so I'm nit even gonna try it
 Jeker#3389: 2020 dot something it is
 Jeker#3389: anyways, unity wont update
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: welp time to get drawing
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Godot it is
 theChief#0001: yoyo haven't reached out this time!
 Bart Moon#2749: Might be worth asking about that.
, have You heard anything about that?
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: Godot is the easiest and the syntax is like python
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: ok
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Probably Godot but maybe Gamemaker Studio 2 if Mark can make the html5 export free again
 Shattered Omega#2221: I'm proficient with coding and most elements of game design, decent at level and UI design
 Scolon#4218: If you want a smooth jam experience it's good to practice a bit with your engine and create dummy itch.io pages
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: Godot
 Bart Moon#2749: UE
 Scolon#4218: It's great to be prepared before things go wrong
 Shattered Omega#2221: I made a post on Teamfinder
 Bart Moon#2749: If you suspect that somebody is already working on the game You can always ask them politely to stop or notify mods. People might be just getting tech help with setting up engines and so on. (which of course is not prohibited)
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: what engine are you using for the jam ?
 theChief#0001: It's people getting help with game development in general!
 L҈e҈ G҈o҈s҈s҈ d҈u҈ N҈e҈t҈#2592: hey guy
 ◈・ Altaꐟ#9999: game jam did not start yet ? why are peoples trying to getting help about their games at game jam help section ?
 Bart Moon#2749: In a jam as big as this one, your game will probably get at most 8-10 minutes of playtime from each player
 Bart Moon#2749: But also don't forget that it is better to have for example 3 well thought-out and polished levels, than 30 that are unfinished
 OMEGA#9033: I have decieded I am going to see what the theem is if I can make a super small scale game I will if not I will do what most of yall sugested and try during a time that works with my schedual
 Scolon#4218: Yeah don't worry about polish until all of your core ideas and content are in place
 Bart Moon#2749: And in general, game jams are still game making, so Pre-Production -> Production -> Polish still applies, although on a smaller scale I guess 😄
 Bart Moon#2749: Factor in some breaks into the schedule and try to make them separate different chunks of development, for example Coding -> Break -> Audio Work -> Break -> Something else. Atleast that's what I try to do, not sure if others will agree with the method
 OMEGA#9033: XD
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: i'm just copying the link lol nothing much
 DrNukeLear#2414: There’s a team builder link (Emi has been awesome supplying it all day), what skills do you have?
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: You too
 OMEGA#9033: sorry to hear that take care of yourself
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I've been struggling with this for the past year, some days are worse, some days are fine.
 OMEGA#9033:  Hope you have a speedy recovry as well Its always difficult for me to say enuff is enuff with work or projects in genaral so I respect you for your decision
 Shattered Omega#2221: I just wanna join a team for this. I didn't realize it was tomorrow!
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: That's what i'm planning on doing aswell got some mental health issues i'm trying to work out.
 OMEGA#9033: yea if I get some time I  would love to help anyone who needed it
 Bart Moon#2749: I'm also sure that there will be people here who would be glad to have their game playtested if somebody has just some free time but wants to help others!
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: No problem, just try to take good care of yourself, there is still next year :D
 OMEGA#9033: yea going on little to no sleep probbly not a good idea also thank you  and 
 Bart Moon#2749: Better rest. If that will make You any happier, as I said, there are Post-Jam Jams, and also another "youtube" jam happens just a month from now (Wowie, by Jonas)
 Sai Sathwik#5188: Any tips on how to structure the process guys ?
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Hope you have a good recovery, being health is very important.
 OMEGA#9033: I have covid atm so my health is a consern 
 Bart Moon#2749: It's better to learn from somebody else mistakes 😄
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: plenty of people make games in three hours
 Bart Moon#2749: If You have time on sunday, maybe just something with a smaller scope, but overworking yourself with trying to work and jam during the same time will probably take a toll on your health
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: I just realised imma be gone on the last day
 OMEGA#9033: yeaaa thanks for the encouragement yall
 Bart Moon#2749: I'm sorry, I know how that feels... No matter how harsh the truth is, it's probably better to follow Light Maker's advice and do it in real free time outside of the competition. There are communities dedicated to Post-Jam updates of the jam games, so You could always go there with Your game for feedback anyway if that is what You care for.
 OMEGA#9033:  I will be off till it starts that day coincedtly and get back late. than have abot 2 hours in the moring before work if I get up early the next day and techinkly I would have till noon sunday I forgot about that
 TheFlow#5803: me too
 Sai Sathwik#5188: Excited for this one! first Game Jam 😁
 Hobusu#5033: The best way is !
 Light Maker 🍧#8953: uvu Good
 OMEGA#9033:  thats a good idea I will probbly do that
 Bart Moon#2749: Do You have a job that prevents You from entering the jam in full capacity or are you meaning that you want to work on the jam game for whole 48h?
 TheFlow#5803: this is not a reason for no Sleep
 Redline#7370: If I stream from 8:00 in the morning to 21:30, I'd have around 12:45 working hours every day with over 8 hours of sleep
 Light Maker 🍧#8953: Why not just make a game with the theme in your own time
 DaveB#7491: I’m getting closer to having my engine building on Windows. Definitely gonna be a photo finish in terms of being ready for the Jam.
 OMEGA#9033: yall probly right but I failed last year and I relly want a nother try
 TheFlow#5803: Sleep G
 Light Maker 🍧#8953: If your schedule doesnt fit with the jam, dont force yourself into it.
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Maybe you don't finish in time that's okay, you tried and that's all that matters. Sleep is very important.
 OMEGA#9033: SLEEP IS FOR THE WEEK
 TheFlow#5803: sleep sometimes
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: get some sleep in.
 Light Maker 🍧#8953: Don't. Just be a watcher or something
 Bart Moon#2749: Don't is the best tip
 TheFlow#5803: you can't do that bro you will die soon
 OMEGA#9033: I have to work both days from morning to late night any tips or sugestions on how to work witout sleep
 TheFlow#5803: i hope this is not metroidvania
 Shattered Omega#2221: How does one join a team for this game jam?
 Light Maker 🍧#8953: Tomorrow
 TheFlow#5803: they give the theme ?
 Light Maker 🍧#8953: Maybe a mini metroidvania with the theme
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: heyoo
 TheFlow#5803: how are you ?
 TheFlow#5803: Hey g
 Light Maker 🍧#8953: I'd do a smile emote but all my emotes are blocked here
 marmaladebacon#4961: if i'm doing the jam this weekend, definitely the time to decide, but the weather's a wee bit too warm for my liking to be in front of the computer so i'm having second thoughts
 PokeNinjaGuy#9592: good plan :D (don't worry about making something quality, just have fun!)
 Redline#7370: step 1. do the thing
step 2. profit 😎
 Light Maker 🍧#8953: This will be my first Jam. No idea how I'll make a fun game in just 2 days
 Redline#7370: that's like an actually good question
 Redline#7370: it's about time to decide, you don't have a lot of time to think about these questions
 PokeNinjaGuy#9592: question, for the theme announcement premier, is the time posted on it when the video comes out or is that like when youtube starts a countdown
 marmaladebacon#4961: wondering if i should switch to godot, been a unity hobbyist for years
 Redline#7370: hmm why?
 Light Maker 🍧#8953: I'm very scared
 SaadTheGlad#9716: Thou shalt not mention thy name in vain
 SaadTheGlad#9716: Who hast mentioned the word Celeste
 BadPiggy#5202: Lol
Now play the jam version of broforce
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: (celeste classic)
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: my fingers are dying from celeste jam
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: nice coincidence.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Please keep countdowns and theme chats to 
 GavRaz#6261: 🕰️ dung dong
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: celeste jam is hard
 Bart Moon#2749: Don't worry about small team/no team for the jam.
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: celeste jam is hard
 DrNukeLear#2414: That’s the day before my daughter’s
 StormyMay#4100: Dawn of the final day, 24 hours remain
 GavRaz#6261: who planning to make videos on the jam?
 GavRaz#6261: that was predicting if i ever saw it
 GavRaz#6261: UHHHHHH
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I have my bday Sunday
 DrNukeLear#2414: Do you have a birthday coming up Sunday? Or am I just imagining it.
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: sounds good to me ;)
 GavRaz#6261: dang im just working with one of my pals
 DrNukeLear#2414: Should be ok. I seem to have been recruited to a team and fallen into the role of a team leader who need directing. But I’m sure we can work something out.
Besides there’s always need for playtesting 😉
 GavRaz#6261: should i make acomputer using breaboards in a brita box
 GavRaz#6261: duh
 R2D2Vader#0693: ~~(in which he leaks the theme ofc)~~ /jk
 GavRaz#6261: but mark gives us cool jams so i aint complaining
 Bart Moon#2749: We just funnel money to Mark, don't get any jam benefits (other than Patron only channels)
 GavRaz#6261: damn tonight ill actually have to sleep
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Take theme talk to  thank you and also no one knows the theme aside from Mark and his ~~fiance~~ wife
 Hobusu#5033: The only people who know the theme are Mark Brown and his wife, and neither of them are telling until tomorrow
 Michel#2879: what a nice theme tho
 MaryStrawberry#4672: yeah orange rpñe is patrons
 GavRaz#6261: sadge
 Michel#2879: oh
 MaryStrawberry#4672: pretty sure they're just a patron
 Fraserfatt#1021: as a treat
 Michel#2879:  would you leak the theme for 5000$
 Fraserfatt#1021: what about a lil pause menu
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I knew it was a good idea to pin that message from Mark lol
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I am still allowed to just vibe with you? I don't have that much time but i'd like to just pop in a vc this weekend and watch you work. I seriously need my mind focused on something other than bad stuff :3
 Triggered#6897: Well, I am sure you can make a game in desmos too
 Hobusu#5033: In addition to what Bart Moon quoted from the rules, there's also a pinned message from Mark clarifying it!
 Ellis#1417: Cheers
 MaryStrawberry#4672: again, I'd be amazed if someone pulls it off considering the limitations
it'd be as cool as someone making ports of their game to the gameboy and the ti-85 in the same time
 Bart Moon#2749: > Can I use pre-existing code?
>
> Yes! You can use pre-existing code, libraries, and functions. But we ask that you don’t write code specifically for this jam, ahead of time.
>
> You can also create things like a blank Unity project, a Github page, or your itch.io profile in advance to save time.
 DrNukeLear#2414: Anytime. If I’m not on here drop a DM and I’ll get back to you.
 GavRaz#6261: i had a game idea about how youre a chemistry teacher with bad students and your goal is to stop kida from killing themselves or destroying the class and can get powerups to make it easier along the way or like abilities like taking kids out of class, that type of thing
 Michel#2879: For some reason Java feels must suitable for me. but it's slow to write and it's against the rules to require someone to install external software ( Jvm counts i guess)
 Ellis#1417: what are the rules on pre written code for the jam?
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: i'm alright, feeling like drawing. Oh btw can I ask you something?
 DrNukeLear#2414: Good thanks, how’re you?
 Hobusu#5033:
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: actually you can do a lot with scratch people made the weirdest stuff with it
 Eyesbesore#7355: we will see about that
 Hobusu#5033: The GMTK Game Jam 2022 starts at , which is !
Remember to keep countdown messages to 
 DrNukeLear#2414: Pirates which board your cubicle and move dividers to take your space!
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Now that it's less than a day to go lease move theme guesses to the   thank you
 MaryStrawberry#4672: too many limitations
 GavRaz#6261: i should make a game in asm language
 Eyesbesore#7355: bro whats wrong with scratch lul
 MaryStrawberry#4672: I'd be genuinely amazed if someone even tries scratch for this jam
 Michel#2879: agrees
 Ellis#1417: lol
 Triggered#6897: .Asm
 GavRaz#6261: unity
p5.js
scratch
 not without text#5469: rank these programming languages/engines from most to least suitable for game jam
unity
scratch
p5.js 
 Triggered#6897: Hyped
 MaryStrawberry#4672: _aaaaaand the theme is **space pirates**!_
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: how's everyone?
 DrNukeLear#2414: Cue mark changing the theme video
 Michel#2879: GMTK themes allow more creativity tho
 Talal#7877: I mean I totally agree with you, but we are doing something like this as a team, individually we are kinda good at things, we are just being ambitious as we dont expect to win, we just wanna drain ourselves work our asses of and do what we can, we plan on sticking together and make a studio after this regardless of if we do good or bad so we are taking this as a scrim tbh where we push ourselves and make our brain cells explode to the point of no return so that after it we can be more confident in the group altogether.
 BadPiggy#5202: Hmmm...... Sounds noice, though idk lol
 TheGameShePlays#7762: My first thought there was a pirate "board game" that came on a disc from PC Format magazine in the 90s, very simple idea but highly addictive!
 MaryStrawberry#4672: can we get this pinned, this is the smartest message in chat ever
 Ellis#1417: tbf thats not the best of themes imo
 DrNukeLear#2414: Just make a raft which flows through a river of logic gates. If you’re not in position to go through a gate, game over. And it gets faster with every gate.
 Michel#2879: I once tried a jam thats theme was "pirates" and I was like wtf, how i will make a simple idea out of it
 BadPiggy#5202: No guns. Only fists
Beat-em-up YEET
 Michel#2879: That's what I like about GMTK
 BadPiggy#5202: Whatever the theme is, I just want to be able to make an action game lol
 MaryStrawberry#4672: if you press the B __or__ the A button you jump
there, I win
 Cameron#7818: Yes, you can. Logic gates with guns.
 TheGameShePlays#7762: Absolutely! Last one I did had strict limits on what could be used, so I learned how to code a type of game I'd never made before. Great experience!
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: lmao
 BadPiggy#5202: Oh pls no.
No logic gates. I can't make an action game out of that lol
 not without text#5469: no idea
 Astrow#4496: ..no one
 Cameron#7818: Yes. It is most likely not about a concrete thing or setting.
 DrNukeLear#2414: It overflowed days ago. Never left.
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: *vibes*
 MaryStrawberry#4672: who said jams were about winning? they're about fun!
 Triggered#6897: Oops you are right maybe I should not have asked that
 Astrow#4496: Hi Im new here. I dont plan on winning a game jam, I barely even know how to do anything in unity but I hear that  they are a great learning experience so i am going to participate in this one
 not without text#5469: o ok
 Bart Moon#2749: Afaik, Theme guessing should go to  if nothing changed from last year, please.
 not without text#5469: either attraction/magnets, shoot to move, letters, logic, or something else
 Bart Moon#2749: I don't suspect any foul play, but it's better to be safe than sorry and I wouldn't advice telling how You rate publicly just in case somebody would feel like they deserve only 5s 😉
 Michel#2879: I can see that GMTK themes are more about ideas (out of countrol, joint together..) than Objects (leaves, gums..)
 MaryStrawberry#4672: just keep it simple
simple great ideas are better than large crappy ones 
 GavRaz#6261: whatever mark decided
 not without text#5469: a syllogism
 Michel#2879: What do you think the theme will be about?
 Triggered#6897: Yeah voting, How do you guys rate, I personally keep the 5 stars for when I really love it, if its good then 4max
 BadPiggy#5202: He plays only from the too 100 for the video.
In his streams he picks randomly
 not without text#5469: gmtk is popular
gmtk has a game jam
gmtk game jam is popular
 Talal#7877: I am working very ambitiously , with ambitious team, we plan on Making a game with good animation, maps ,Cut scene animation and self made music (we intended to make a rap song/metal song for the cutscene but seem like we wont have that much time for that lol)
 TheGameShePlays#7762: last jam I did, I got amazing feedback and comments throughout, and then my otherwise-decent (3 to 5 star) ratings were skewed by some last-minute 1s and 2s out of nowhere and my averages tanked... so I'm not hoping for much even if I finish and submit 😅
 GavRaz#6261: got lmms B)
 Bart Moon#2749: Nah, never random. Maybe You're thinking about his streams?
 MaryStrawberry#4672: I thought last time he just picked randomly?
 Bart Moon#2749: We all are! Public voting over 1 week after the jam finishes. Mark picks his picks from top 100
 DrNukeLear#2414: I’m doing a one man preparatory Jam. Theme is: Shoot to Move.
 Bart Moon#2749: All behold the almighty download only UE Games
 Eyesbesore#7355: who are ranking the    game
 GavRaz#6261: Do it.
 Talal#7877: watch the previous games winner, from what I have learned it doesnt have to be big, just a nice idea polished, u can literally create 2 or 3 levels, what most people do though is like 1 MAP which has replayability
 Michel#2879: I can tho If I install crazy Unity libraries that I am not gonna use
 MaryStrawberry#4672: (adds a 2 GB coconut texture to the game)
 Michel#2879: Yeah I am probably not making a 1gb game in 2 days
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: That's all my team is gonna make.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: One singular level.
 King Khan#1259: ok
 Talal#7877: No not really, I mean the game size limit is 1gb as well so.
 MaryStrawberry#4672: depends on the mechanic you're working on
 Michel#2879: how many levels would we expect to make? 10
 BadPiggy#5202: The smaller
The tighter
The better
 Bart Moon#2749: Quite the opposite, small is usually much better
 Michel#2879: it does not have to be a big game tho right?
 BadPiggy#5202: At worst, you'll be in the top 3000. Anything below is usually stuff that is unplayable
 Talal#7877: Game Maker itself is an engine on which you can create 2d games easily I believe, its a really good way of marketing; I respect them for the fact that there is no limitation on what engine to use
 King Khan#1259: you too!
 Bart Moon#2749: Don't worry 😄 it's usually "only" about 5,5k games 😉
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: You got this!
 King Khan#1259: I hope to reach top 17.9k this year :)
 King Khan#1259: Wow, that's really good then, glad to be in it this year
 birdstone#3073: it is one hell of a mental reward lmao
 Bart Moon#2749: Mark's channel is rather popular with people that want to make games, which is exactly the audience that also takes part in game jams. The jam is very well run, has interesting themes and easy to understand rules. People also want to get a chance to be showcased in the video.
The partnership with itch helps for sure, and also just the snowball effect.
 TheGameShePlays#7762: Yeah I did one recently with quite tight limitations and while it was fun, it was hard!
 Michel#2879: even being on the top #100 would feel like an achievement
 birdstone#3073: top 100 get the chance to be in mark's top 20 picks
 BadPiggy#5202: Mark's videos about game design
 Seinaru#6185: Thanks a lot guys!
 King Khan#1259: oh alright and what is this game maker?
 Michel#2879: also GMTK is very fair. It has no strict rules and 20 people get to win
 Talal#7877: Thanks alot 🙂
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Because.
 Talal#7877: I believe for the past couple of years some of the games dev made it as proper devlopers and made some famous Indie games
 King Khan#1259: Jam
 Bart Moon#2749: Jam or Channel? or both?
 Jemmeh#7117: depends on your team but for us yeah. 3 days is short and we're 2 people
bigger teams probably trello 
 Seinaru#6185: If I do that I lose myself on YT or doing other things/looking to nowhere lmao
 King Khan#1259: I have a question why is GMTK so popular?
 TheGameShePlays#7762: I do have a big cheap A3 pad of newsprint paper as well, if I need a big list or to map something out.
 Triggered#6897: When you upload a game you create a page first which include Description Screnshots basically its the Game Page just like you would see on steam
There you can upload files
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: this means the game upload itself, you upload the game first then add it to the jam, and then you can edit it i assume is the gist
 Bart Moon#2749: You submit Your game on Itch.io where the jam is hosted. After creating new project (Itch -> Dashboard -> Create new project) it will get it's own page.
 TheGameShePlays#7762: if I'm feeling organised, I use Notion (has options for boards etc like other apps but also more customisable, databases, checklists etc)>
if I'm not, "bit of paper with things scribbled on it"
 Seinaru#6185: I guess the simpler the better huh, makes sense
 Talal#7877: what is games itch page?
 Talal#7877: Games Itch Page
 Talal#7877: Thanks alot  and   just look at their replies I believe
 Michel#2879: lmao I just work randomly and hope it goes fine
 K'miinik#3171: same
 Jemmeh#7117: Google docs and Sheets all the way for me
 DrNukeLear#2414: Google Spreadsheet and a megaphone over voice chat.
 Bart Moon#2749: 1 Person submits the project, you can add others as contributors
.
 Jemmeh#7117: 24hrs to go
 Redline#7370: trello yes
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: I was about to ask this too, I don't see it in the FAQ only a teammember finder which I'm *debating* using for 3D artists and sounde designers
 DrNukeLear#2414: Just discussing colours.
 Seinaru#6185: Hello everyone! I have a question for yous, what program do you usually use to keep your work on track? I have been using ClickUp, but maybe there better apps for that, I saw someone mentioning Trello which I’ve never used, but I see a lot of people use it
 Triggered#6897: Build can be upload by one of you and other can be added as contributor, atleast thats how I understand it
 Michel#2879: Are you guys prepearing assests for the jam or what
 Talal#7877: Hi guys can someone tell me whether I have to submit a team ? I am in a team or 4-5 I believe, we had to register separately, do I have to inform Gamejam that we are a team ?
 BadPiggy#5202: Aye that works
 DrNukeLear#2414: Five is about right. Black, Grey, White, Red, Orange.
 K'miinik#3171: but I've been getting more
 K'miinik#3171: I struggle to get more than 8 a lot of the time
 BadPiggy#5202: Anything greater than 5 colours is a large pallete to me lol
 Redline#7370: that's like 4 colors with 4 shades lmao
 K'miinik#3171: 16 isn't really a "large" palette is the issue, lmao
 birdstone#3073: oh yeah, it's become my preferred style now
 BadPiggy#5202: How did you do it though ? Just asking
 BadPiggy#5202: I feel the same in a lot of ways
But I myself actually prefer limited palletes. So I don't think I'd really do large palletes justice lol
 DrNukeLear#2414: I did hand drawn animation for one jam once. It was actually less painful than expected.
 birdstone#3073: my favourite triple a game hungry knight
 K'miinik#3171: I've been trying to make myself use more colors, because i generally try to style my stuff after the GBA (and sometimes actually make stuff for it), but I rarely take full advantage of the capabilities in terms of palettes
 Lyfe#8258: Spent like 15 or 20 minutes doing maths to work out what angle to rotate an isometric diamond to make the edge parallel to the bottom, but it's the wrong shape anyway and I could have just done different maths to shear a square and it would have been more accurate
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: it seems like all good games started from jams
 BadPiggy#5202: Lol. Good luck
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: wot
no Imma play celeste jam
 BadPiggy#5202: Now play super hot jam edition
 Triggered#6897: Thats punishment
 GavRaz#6261: yeahhhh
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: Just finished baba is you jam in 24 minutes
 birdstone#3073: for this jam i'm gonna use **notepad** and **traditional paper animation** to make my game
 GavRaz#6261: who using ibis paint x for pixel art
 Redline#7370: yes that's how it's supposed to work
 BadPiggy#5202: I've done 1-bit games for so long that I adore art which uses only 2-3 colours now lol
Makes me want to draw with pencil or black ink now
 Lyfe#8258: Oh I'm actually dumb as bricks
 K'miinik#3171: I think it's maybe because i draw with a mouse, so it's a lot harder to translate it over i guess
 GavRaz#6261: and it was in ibis paint x
 birdstone#3073: if you can walk you can fly a plane
 GavRaz#6261: my pfp was made by a friend actually i never made this pfp of mine
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: i think everything i learned about color translates pretty well to traditional art
 BadPiggy#5202: I mean, if you can ride a bike, you can drive a car
 K'miinik#3171: not very, but kinda
 GavRaz#6261: huh
 K'miinik#3171: it's really weird how little my skill with pixel art translates over to traditional mediums
 birdstone#3073: lmao yup, though i do enjoy doing hand drawn animation for games
my artstyle is simpler than hollow knight so i don't have to worry too much about complexity
 BadPiggy#5202: ( sad pig noises )
 GavRaz#6261: sadge :(
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: sad
 GavRaz#6261: i cant cus im probably better with pixel art then on paper also no scanner :(
 BadPiggy#5202: Both cuphead and hollow knight did this
 Triggered#6897: ~~you profile picture says how much it helps~~ no offence :)
 Redline#7370: would be actually cool tho
 GavRaz#6261: HAHAH
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: *do it. Do it. - jk. unless- nah.*
 BadPiggy#5202: Drawing tab ? XD
 GavRaz#6261: everytime i code i feel liek someones gonna complain about the noise
 birdstone#3073: that's enough discord for today
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: that would pog off in a jam
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I have no clue. XD
 Triggered#6897: Is there any one who uses VR for pixel art
 GavRaz#6261: my keyboard is like that
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: My mouse is loud as fuck and my parents sometimes complain if I click a lot in a short timespan XD
 birdstone#3073: *nah ill be drawing on paper inking and scanning it, traditional animation*
 BadPiggy#5202: Even I use a mouse for pixel art lol
What's weird about it ? XD
 GavRaz#6261: itll be fineeeee
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: not everyone does XD I've had many people look weird cus I used a mouse. idk why/
 Redline#7370: I'm the weird kid who uses a silent mouse and makes pixel art in photoshop
 GavRaz#6261: yeah
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: I was fully planning on doing pixel art this jam but i’ve been brushing up on digital art this week, so idk now
 GavRaz#6261: im actually not going to use any web builds for my game
 BadPiggy#5202: Wait, people don't draw pixel art with a mouse ?
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: and somehow it works-
 Redline#7370: pro tip for my fellow windows gamers:
You can create a shortcut of a website on your desktop by right-clicking -> new -> shortcut, and putting the website's link where it asks for a file.
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I'm like the weird kid who uses a mouse and paint to make pixelart.
 GavRaz#6261: :)
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I draw pixelart with my mouse :3 also pixelart, like anything takes a bit of practice
 BadPiggy#5202: Just go 2.5D
Horrible pixel art automatically looks awesome lol
 GavRaz#6261: also only gonna use the grace kelly harmonic to make my music for it cus i know mothing else lmao
 GavRaz#6261: cus thats what im doing cus i suck at pixel art
 GavRaz#6261: you think a kinda pixel art but i drew with only mouse style would look decent
 BadPiggy#5202: *:linkPig: emote
 birdstone#3073: someone needs to make a :linkPog: emote
 BadPiggy#5202: Why do you think my name is what it is kek
 GavRaz#6261: i didnt even take out the transistors out of the bag or fry any LEDs :(
 GavRaz#6261: idk if i have confidence or not considering this my first time
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I was gonna draw more on silly fan art yet here I am with a half finished blackoutlines XD
 BadPiggy#5202: Of course I do
 KG_#6669: I ordered 3 jam shirts and only 2 came 😭
 birdstone#3073:  do you have bad piggies on your phone
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Hello back!
 yugioh#7402: Hello people I'm back
 birdstone#3073: lmao yup, i think i have a bit more confidence from last year
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Piggy has 40 pigs doing his code.
 GavRaz#6261: trueeee, was gonna do some circuitry to kill off the morning then prepare in the afternoon but here we are
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: It's just too fun here. Curse you server for having amazing people!
 BadPiggy#5202: Bah, no need to worry.
Looking a how popular the jam is, we're going to be seeing a large number of teams with a large amount of people in each one
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Yo, same. I have a problem...
 Hannes#5054: Hi
 birdstone#3073: i have done zero jam preparation ill be fiiiiiiine
 RiverDog#8199: so i updated my movement to the new unity system, and i was transforming my position previously but it was stepping over the border boundary.  Well after I got everything hooked up the movement was so weird and the grid was moving everywhere i was like what the heck just happened.  Turns out the grid was free floating and had the same mass as the player haha was a crazy effect
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: *when you were planning on doing something but you've been stuck in this chat for the past idk how long.*
 BadPiggy#5202: Bugulon has 20+ peeps lol. Just that sometimes, only a few of them participate
 birdstone#3073: i thought they had less? but it was another team
notyoursaggitarius is in team bugalon i think
 GavRaz#6261: talent.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: many people
 ThatTrashGameDEV#0639: hey anyone doing this jamsolo i am
 GavRaz#6261: its just me and my good friend
 BadPiggy#5202: Team Bugulon ?
 birdstone#3073: hopefully communication and coordination goes well
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: 24 person, last I checked.
 GavRaz#6261: damn brought the whole studio with lol
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: *AH YES PEOPLE*
 birdstone#3073: **someone here has a 22 person team**
 GavRaz#6261: 11 PERSON!?!
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: seems like a nice thing, to meet people again. I cannot wait to see what your 11 person team creates!
 GavRaz#6261: good for you!
 birdstone#3073: excited to see what your team will come up with mr quantum love
 BadPiggy#5202: Me
 ThatTrashGameDEV#0639: whos doing this jam solo
 GavRaz#6261: yeah, good way to put it
 BadPiggy#5202: I hope people find whatever I made fun lol
And I'm not worried about other peeps. There's always going to be atleast a few good games
 ThatTrashGameDEV#0639: hey whos up for this years gamejame
 GavRaz#6261: if i find bugs ill just go haha and only play with the bug for an insane amount of time
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Nice!
 Viola_Buddy#6763: The last real game I made was back in Flash and ActionScript. 👴
 GavRaz#6261: the only friend of mine in this jam is the very same im working with
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I'm excited to playtest people's games. Just gonna enjoy my time :D
 GavRaz#6261: damn
 BadPiggy#5202: I once did 4 jams in a month lol
Slept for 2 weeks after that
 GavRaz#6261: its gonna be interesting
 birdstone#3073: this is the way to put it
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I mean, unless you actually literally do it everyday. Lol.
 RedTeapot#1960: I mean, it's a specific kind of _fun_
 birdstone#3073: ~~"fun" he says~~
 GavRaz#6261: i started from the age old platform of roblox, then decided wow actual game dev is cool and i can join this cool jam in a couple of months? dont mind if i do!
 GavRaz#6261: not everyday youre in a fun game dev competition
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: 
 Viola_Buddy#6763: This is not only my first jam; it's also my first game I've made at all in any capacity in many years (other than, like, Unity tutorials - I'm not using Unity for this because I haven't advanced far enough into Unity tutorials to be comfortable with figuring it out in two days). Trial by fire indeed.
 GavRaz#6261: agreed! for me its something new
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Can't wait for a weekend of fun vibing with people! It'll be a very very fun time.
 GavRaz#6261: hopefully the jam doesnt give only 3d options
 TheGameShePlays#7762: I'm thinking I might learn something new today, just find a tutorial and make something I haven't coded before. I'm rather optimistically hoping it'll give me more to choose from for the jam 😂
 GavRaz#6261: thats all that matters
 BadPiggy#5202: Damn. I haven't used jetbrain products in a while lol
 GavRaz#6261: itll be fun either way
 BadPiggy#5202: Oof. First jams are trials by fire
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I made an attempt at starting on fan art. *tests succesful.*
 RedTeapot#1960: Somewhat related: JetBrains IDEs have an awesome merge conflict resolve tool. Wish there was a standalone thing like that because it makes merge conflicts way less scary and complicated
 GavRaz#6261: test project/learning project: working on it but so far success!
this jam will be hectic, mainly cus its my first lol
 RedTeapot#1960: Not that you want it though
 BadPiggy#5202: Learn how to undo commits as well lol.
You'll need it
 Nobody6502#8971: test project: success!
Can't wait to make something amazing this weekend
 RedTeapot#1960: Uh, I think it's entirely possible to have to edit one file if there are multiple programmers. Like some kind of a manager or something. Even if the tasks are separate
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: no one should ever be working on the same file at the same time. You never want overlapping work. Each person should have a seperate task
 RedTeapot#1960: Gotta do some merging (sometimes with conflicts). Although that can be avoided by not changing the same files
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: use github, or use some other version control, no one should ever be working on the same thing at the same time so it shouldn't be an issue
 GavRaz#6261: mr. davenport - "me too!"
 GavRaz#6261: im joking
 birdstone#3073: "mr teacher i can't see the whiteboard my eyes are lagging"
 BadPiggy#5202: Don't do that lol. You'll actually get disqualified
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: It just was the first thing I could come up with lmao.  It would something I definitly replay a game for.
 GavRaz#6261: just use godot best engine
 RedTeapot#1960: I don't think there is such a thing as "eye FPS" because the perception is continuous (albeit with a bit of lag)
 birdstone#3073: damn
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: not usre I haven't used unity in a while
 GavRaz#6261: thanks for the stellar idea!
 Äml#2258: and how do you go about that? what if 2 people work at the same time?
 birdstone#3073: wasn't that changed to plastic scm?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: most people that I know of use github mainly because unity collab can be hard to use
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: *at the end of the game a message appears: "Did you find the 7 hidden Mark's we've hidden around the game?", you haven't, curious you decided to replay the game.*
 GavRaz#6261: we were arguing about lua pluginscript binaries existing and the only binaries were in the DLLs lol
 BadPiggy#5202: Me playing Celeste jam build
And I already died. Wtf
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: me playing baba is you jam build
 GavRaz#6261: oh boy, for me my pal is in russia so there is quite the timezone juggling and github galore cus were using godot
 Äml#2258: Unity Collab?
 Äml#2258: How are you guys going about working in a team?
 Viola_Buddy#6763: I think I saw something like the frame rate of the eye is around 13 FPS. But like, obviously you can tell the difference between a 15 FPS and a 30 FPS game - I don't remember the details of what 13 FPS was exactly. Maybe it was 13 distinct frames (i.e. not in an animation, but 13 unrelated images), or maybe it was that your eye is 13 FPS but in practice you need a much higher frame rate because your eye won't "refresh" at the same time as the frame on the screen refreshes, or maybe 13 FPS was an approximation because the eye doesn't actually "refresh" in frames in the same way that a screen refreshes.
Also I might just be misremembering the 13 FPS figure entirely. That's also possible.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: you're fine, its more stuff like; don't use Mark or the mods etc as characters or make them the theme of your game. having a reference or an easter egg of the logo etc is fine
 Redline#7370: I love how my test webgl build is already taking over 7 minutes, but it's the first build and it cashes a bunch of stuff so it will be faster later
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: go mark ball
 GavRaz#6261: 🤫
 birdstone#3073: "okay the theme is PANTS ARE FOR LOSERS"
- Mark Brown
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: mark's hp is low, time to catch it
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I need to finish the pokémon anime. I made it to gen 4 and completely forgot about it. whoops
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: You can stop shouting, we can see your messages
 redve#6507: How to effectively show certain rectangles, which are close to player, if you have lots of them. Is there anything except linearly checking the distance to each rectangle
 GavRaz#6261: quick guys dont talk about jam themes! dont let mark get any ideas! 🤫
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: SPRIGATITO USE BE CUTE
 BadPiggy#5202: The theme is " stealth "
But fr. Someone pls make a stealth game
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: *grabs master ball*
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: GO SPRIGATItO
 Redline#7370: hmm yes one of the marks!
 Hobusu#5033: ```A wild Mark Brown appears!```
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: heyoo :3
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: jesus, Mark sneak attack there
 Mark Brown#6982: Yes, that sounds fine to me
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: wot
wdym
 Hobusu#5033: It's certainly possible to tell the difference between 30 fps and 60 fps, but you're right that it's not by being able to see the individual frames at that point
 GavRaz#6261: umm cant help you there im no master of camera algorithms
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: Hey question, reading the rules it says not to make a game BASED on Mark or GMTK, however you provide logos that we "may" include in our game, Are we okay to use these as background assets like on billboards or gas canisters etc. interactable in a game kind of like looney tunes uses "acme", as generating art assets is a bit of a pain when you're lacking artistic ability otherwise
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: take it to  if you really must
 redve#6507: Algorithm to effectively play with camera
 BadPiggy#5202: Anything lesser and you can tell if something's choppy
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: OK CLASSIC FAKE NEWS SORRY I'M DELETING IT
 BadPiggy#5202: Afaik, you can't really tell frames apart of it's more than 25 fps
 GavRaz#6261: what kind of math?
 redve#6507: If i didn't messed the numbers
 GavRaz#6261: i got a pc when i was really young and downloaded sims 2 virus lol
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: RIP, I'm sorry for your loss
 redve#6507: Tests show can human eye can see over 240 fps
 Hobusu#5033: I did get to play the original games back when they were still fairly new, but I didn't *own* them
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: Also did you knew that the human eye can't see more than 240 fps?
So people who give A LOT of money to powerful pcs are stupid?
 BadPiggy#5202: I'd love to fire up my ps2 again, but every disc I have for it apparently can't be read anymore :(
Even after I preserved them as well
Guess my console is kaput
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: Ahh, I was a GBC/Blue child
But Emerald is 100% the best pokemon game
 GavRaz#6261: its actually a monumental surprise
 redve#6507: Can i ask here about math help?
 Hobusu#5033: The first video game system I ever owned was a GBA, and the first game I got for it was Pokémon Emerald; this will likely not come as a surprise given my user icon and such, lol
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: IF you have a good pc, a controller and some budget, you don't need consoles
 GavRaz#6261: my 360 is a champ, never has redringed in its entire existence, lucky model id say
 Jemmeh#7117: I use an Xbox controller with my PC that's as close as I get to console lol
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I haven't used my consoles for ages, they're not even set up or plugged in yet
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: I so damn like the ds series
Why nintendo ended them?
 BadPiggy#5202: All of the games I have for my ps2 stopped working :(
And I had some good stuff too
 Redline#7370: I still don't have a console and I don't want one lol
 GavRaz#6261: 360 and a dsi
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: COnsoles? YoU guYs Had CoNsoLES?
The only console I ever seen in my home was my dad's PS2
 GavRaz#6261: 💀
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Was I necessarily talking to you or replying to your post? Hmm?
 GavRaz#6261: damn
 BadPiggy#5202: Once I got into university, it's like they forgot I existed.
Freedom lol
 GavRaz#6261: still not great
 BadPiggy#5202: My parents were really strict with me when I was a kid tbh.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Lets not be giving out people's ages on the internet
 Hobusu#5033: It's hard to emphasize strongly enough how obsessed *everyone* was with Pokémon when it was new
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: wdym you need to be adult to jam?
 BadPiggy#5202: I never owned a console apart from a PS2 when I turned 14 lol
 GavRaz#6261: i was born at the very end of early 00s like just enough so i can participate in this jam
 Hobusu#5033: You might've just missed the height of its original popularity, then
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: so you was a ds kid huh?
 Tapu#9161: me too, there was buzz around pokemon cards when I was in elementary but I didn't get into them
 Jemmeh#7117: I was too poor to be into Pokemon. My friends gave me their cards when the trend was over lol
 BadPiggy#5202: Born in 2000
 Hobusu#5033: Were you a kid in the late 90s/early 00s? Because it was nearly unavoidable back then, haha
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: The think, my guy, is that I AM a kid (more than 13 but you get the point)
 Tapu#9161: I can pretty accurately remake game crashing
 BadPiggy#5202: Funny thing is that I'm only sorta looking into anime and stuff now only lol
Didn't get to really do anything back in school
 Jemmeh#7117: The Jam Game Jam for games centered around jelly
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: theres game jams for everything
 GavRaz#6261: SAME
 BadPiggy#5202: Am I the only one who actually didn't pay much attention to Pokémon when he was a kid ? Lol
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH
Then it sucks
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: thats already a thing
 GavRaz#6261: game where you have to demake a game
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: never heard of it but sure
 Hobusu#5033: It's a common misconception that Rock-type Pokémon are immune to Electric because a lot of Rock-types are also Ground-types, but all three of the fossil Pokémon from the original games are *weak* to Electric despite being part Rock-type (Rock/Water or Rock/Flying)
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: I was sure that it was
Like in spiritomb that fightings would be super effective, but hit 0 damage because ghost
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: oh you mean the mix and game jam lol its about remaking a game machnic as accurately as possible
 GavRaz#6261: its just a collection of files
 BadPiggy#5202: There are some jams which are centered around demaking games
 R2D2Vader#0693: theme: plagiarism
 GavRaz#6261: dont give mark ideas
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: imagine if there was a theme to copy another game
 BadPiggy#5202: Well I mean .....
 GavRaz#6261: imagine insomnia was a jam theme
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: ROCK DOESN'T RESIST EL-damn it, too slow
 BadPiggy#5202: Oink
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: bababa ba ba ba baba ba ba
 BadPiggy#5202: Oof. Ludum Dare happened once right between my exams. I got lucky then but I don't recommend trying to do both.
All the best though
 Hobusu#5033: Flying is weak to electric, rock does not resist it
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: 👀
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: BUT I AM ROCK BIRB IT'S NOT EFFECTIVE
 GavRaz#6261: me on do not disturb
 Jemmeh#7117: Woo one more day! Spending a lot of today prepping so I don't have to do anything but jam this weekend
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: me weird?
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: Weak to electric moves though 😛
 RedTeapot#1960: Birb is the wirb
 Tapu#9161: Thanks  and 
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: Birb
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: no, electric is not effective to rock types
 Tapu#9161: Yeah term final. Our classes started in March
 RedTeapot#1960: Oofers. Good luck on the exams though!
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: that sucks good luck luck for your exams
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: you have exams still? It's July
 Hobusu#5033: I guess Assist ended up copying a water or electric move, heh
 Tapu#9161: Exam starts 3 days later and there's too much to study
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: why
 Tapu#9161: Seems like I gotta skip this jam
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: (it's super effective!)
 Hobusu#5033: It would take either actively avoiding it or just completely forgetting about the Jam, haha
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: oh no blaziken is using assist!!!
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: Imagine someone missing the theme
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yeah it'll be on the youtube channel, there will probably be a tweet, it'll be announced here. it'll be pinned in every channel and like multiple thousand people will be discussing it. You will not miss the theme
 Scolon#4218: Also I believe there's an everyone ping when the theme is announced, so you can't miss it
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yeah the itch page has the times in your local timezone. It starts in about 25 hours
 Scolon#4218: Check the itch page for countdown
 Scolon#4218: No, if it started this chat would be exploding
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: you're making a full game you're making a prototype
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: scale down your idea of a "full game"
 ZEST#7932: Has the jam started ?
 Scolon#4218: Just focus on the things you know how to do, like I assume you know how to program your core game mechanics already
 Cletus2000#0709: No animations 😎
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Lol how am I ever going to create a full game in 48 hours when I can't get basic player animations to work in a day
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Although this is also why its good to upload multiple tiles over the course of the jam because then if all else fails you have a version up and connected and ready
 Scolon#4218: Just try not to overscope and make something really small at first, polish that and if you have time you can expand afterwards
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yeah it kind of takes the piss a bit when someone is asking why its taking so long from their game page colours to update when a bunch of people are freaking out because the webite is frozen and their game won't upload, so its best just to add your game, check its connected to the jam properly then get out the way for other people
 Cletus2000#0709: Ok, lets not wait until the last minute
 Scolon#4218: iirc there's a rush of submissions near the end of the jam and sometimes itch.io servers can be unresponsive
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yeah because like 5000 people will be trying to upload a game at the same time
 GavRaz#6261: idk
 Cletus2000#0709: To avoid overcharging servers?
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: oki thanks
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: after the jam is finished its your game to do what you want with
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: We actually recommend this: put just just the basic page, get off the itch website to let other people upload stuff then go back after the jam and do all the decoration stuff
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: I assume you can update the game after the winner/votes are decided if you want to continue it
 Cletus2000#0709: Ok thx
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: For game jams in general you'd have to check the rules of the jam, but definitely for this one yes you can edit he look of the page and the game information as much as you want, you just can't change the files once the time is up
 Lawn#1538: Yes and yes. You can leave it basic and edit after the submission time. And I vaguely remember that you can’t upload a new version until after the jam?
 GavRaz#6261: am i weird for using godot and then on top of that using a lua pluginscript to script the whole game instead of gdscript
 Cletus2000#0709: How does itchio manage game pages in jams? Like, can i leave it all basic and ugly, submit the game and then edit just the page even if the jam has closed as long as i dont upload any changes to the game itself?
 GavRaz#6261: 🙏
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: That's a lovely thing, i'm most likely gonna draw some general fan art with the mods and mod helpers, the tech support and ofc Mark in it. Little appreciation for their job :D (also I like to draw pfp's soo win-win)
 GavRaz#6261: make sure to check the itch page for further info
 Scolon#4218: If you're using unity though just make a WebGL build, if possible
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: yeah lol, also you don't need infinity it can be like 4000 and be accurate enough
 GavRaz#6261: if it uses anything special like a dll make sure to include it in the download (that kind of thing)
 Scolon#4218: You can use anything as long as the the user isn't required to download external software to run your game
 GavRaz#6261: minus roblox and that type of thing
 R2D2Vader#0693: unity's probably one of the more popular engines for this jam
 ◈・ Altaꐟ#9999: alright
 GavRaz#6261: any engine
 ◈・ Altaꐟ#9999: can i make my game in unity for game jam ? or i need to download a game maker
 Peter#0007: ooh lovely dubly!
 GavRaz#6261: uh oh
 GavRaz#6261: 😬 😬 😬
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: get your computer and tools updated, make sue you know how to export a game and upload it to itch
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Found one! It's `((x - h) / 2a)^inf + ((y-k) / 2b)^inf = 1`
 GavRaz#6261: and blue ones plus green ones
 GavRaz#6261: instead of frying yellow LEDs
 GavRaz#6261: :| probably should do the tutorials i need to do even tho im better with lua in godot
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: please keep countdowns to 
 R2D2Vader#0693: everyone is cramming tutorials meanwhile i'm just sitting here having not made a game in over a year
 R2D2Vader#0693: time is ticking counting down to the jam 😉
 unityAccount#7810: The jam hasn't even started :/
 Scolon#4218: omg guys time is ticking!!!!
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: That's some amazing fan art.
 GavRaz#6261: 🙏
 GavRaz#6261: our lord and savior
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Woop poow
 GavRaz#6261: i gotta speedrun 5 tutorials because i cant manage my time lol
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: probs server fan art, tho if I find time i'm just gonna make a little gif with game ideas I've played/found fun. Not sure yet what i'll do
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Make fan art of our games?
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: time to do dumb fan art things this weekend.
 Hobusu#5033: It took 10000 hours
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: ill look lol
 Peter#0007: probably!
 Arroganttony#3300: First time to the jam!
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: is there an equation for a rectangle? Because I could easily do the same problem for a cirlce as it has an equation
 Bronsolo#4491: Rad. Thank you
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: We had 21.1k last year?
 Lawn#1538: Nope.
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: hmm ok, I have no clue still lmao
 Bronsolo#4491: Is there a rule against being in two teams?
 Peter#0007: ok nevermind my solution is broken but i know you need to normalize that line into a vector at some point
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: thats fine I only checked it like 10 times so there's sure to be a spelling mistake somewhere lol
 Lawn#1538: *still reading pdf*
 DrNukeLear#2414: Should have taken part in a Cheat Sheet Jam.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: that only took me what, 2 years to make lol
 DrNukeLear#2414: Looks good to me.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Is the the engine you're using for the jam?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: ty
 theChief#0001: it works 🙂
 Lawn#1538: Sure thing.
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: yeah it does for me
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I'm paranoid lol
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: you'll do lol, can you just super quick double check the pdf I pinned just to be sure it shows up properly
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: ok nice 😄
 Lawn#1538: I use transmutation circles.
 Comfie#3125: Haven’t gotten around to it yet
 DrNukeLear#2414: I’ve done a couple. Good fun.
 Peter#0007: ok i think i have a solution but i'm going to test it first so one sec
 Comfie#3125: I’d love to do one
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Imagine an irl game jam lol
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I do
 DrNukeLear#2414: Do you summon Staff Members like Pokemon?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: probably, it has been for the last couple of years (online)
 coronelrsm#8055: is this the biggest jam of the year?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I summon thee
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Dotwo are you alive?
 Comfie#3125: Not bad
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Ok Nice 😄 - Imma try it (again) as well
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I made a dumb fan art thing. Why idk either.
 coronelrsm#8055: actually 17,8k joined
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Thanks Walrusware
 Peter#0007: Ok give me a sec I’ll write it out
 Kevin Eleven    o7🐷👑#5306: Yup
 AquaduckStudio#0780: its gonna be tough making a game in 48 hours
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824:
 Comfie#3125: Totally, if I’ll make anything
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Yes
 Kevin Eleven    o7🐷👑#5306: U guys ready for this jam?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Cheat sheet about launching a game on itch but also super importantly the last step of adding the game to the game jam
 Peter#0007: Is the line between their centres always?
 Comfie#3125: Easy, declare me as the winner already
 coronelrsm#8055: more than 17k I think
 Comfie#3125: This is very true
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: How many people joined? I cant see. I'm on mobile.
 Peter#0007: Not for a day and 90 minutes
 Comfie#3125: Game jam time 😬😬😬
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: There are 2 boxes, A and B. There is a line between the 2 boxes. You know the coordinates of the start and end of the line. You also know the width and height of both boxes. Can you figure out a way/formula using these to calculate the intersection of the line and box edge (shown by the red arrow on the diagram)
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Im drawing an image to demonstrate
 Peter#0007: go right ahead
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: yeah I'm stuck on something in my code so I can show you if you want
 Peter#0007: o?
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: I have a problem solving issue if anyone wants to try it?
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: haha its alr 😄
 Peter#0007: Oh haha lol sorry
 BadPiggy#5202: I just thought of a nice little shoot-to-move concept that I could do for the jam if I can't think of an idea for the theme lol
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Google Game Maker's Toolkit on github and you got it there
 Tapu#9161: I was also wondering why the change of jam url format
 Omegnight#7081: 16 people joined (true url is "/gmtk-jam-2022" btw)
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: XD
 R2D2Vader#0693: can you release the source on github? or is it already out?
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Heyo just checking in, does this offer still stand? I don't have that much time but i'd like to just pop in a vc this weekend and watch you work. I seriously need my mind focused on something other than bad stuff
 SlamBamActionman#7160: We have plans to make it available outside GMTK, though it will take some more work! It's programmed with it in mind at least 🙂
 tuon#7436:  - This is only a question.  No issue with the site!!  In fact, it's really NICE!  My question is - do you have any plans to make this into something that could be used for any game jam?  If not, I may have to borrow some of your ideas.  😁   (p.s. sorry for reaching out this way if it's somehow inappropriate!)
 DrNukeLear#2414: All my preparation was a waste!
 R2D2Vader#0693: someone should make a game called "supercold"
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: The answer (finally did it) is NOT(NOT A AND NOT B)
 NitramiuZ#4145: But it could also happen that I burn myself out now... let's hope not
 NitramiuZ#4145: I'm doing complex mountain erosion simulations in godot right now, maybe in hope that making a game during the jam will feel easy in comparison
 HerrCron#5856: SUPER HOT
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: It made an XOR gate
 Peter#0007: yeah it's just an offhand guess don't build your liferaft using it
 Peter#0007: spent part of my semester last term doing formal logic and its pretty satisfying that you can know the values for sure for such big problems
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: I'll try it
 SaadTheGlad#9716: Yee! I remember very clearly doing this a lot in my physics classes
 SaadTheGlad#9716: And see if you can combine them to give you the same values you get from an OR gate
 Peter#0007: truth table gang!!!!
 Peter#0007: NOT(A and B) AND NOT(not A and not B)
 SaadTheGlad#9716: Here, try drawing up a table of both AND and NOT gate values
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Yeah I just can't figure it out lol
 SaadTheGlad#9716: Hmm, I'm pretty sure I could figure this out buuuut it would take a bit
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: I have a logic sim app, and it only gives you AND and NOT gates, and I can't wire more than 1 wire into an output ._.
 PepperTroopa#4091: the theme is ||video games||
 SaadTheGlad#9716: Why?
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: How to make an OR gate with only NOT and AND gates?
 R2D2Vader#0693: shoot to move in the most literal sense
 DrNukeLear#2414: Strafe
 R2D2Vader#0693: :0 moving backwards when shooting???
 DrNukeLear#2414: Just wait until you find out that I’m not moving forwards when shooting.
 R2D2Vader#0693: just wait till shoot to move becomes disallowed in the rules 😭
 R2D2Vader#0693: stove to mooh
 SaadTheGlad#9716: shove to moot
 R2D2Vader#0693: ***shoot-to-move-ception***
 DrNukeLear#2414: I’m tempted to add a shoot to move mechanic just to prove the concept.
 yumaikas#3530: It should take cues from Vampire Survivors, and be move to shoot, this time
 SaadTheGlad#9716: **It's always shoot to move.**
 R2D2Vader#0693: it's actually shoot to move /j
 DrNukeLear#2414:  does your part of the UK feel like it’s on fire. It definitely does in Wales.
 DrNukeLear#2414: I know, right.
 SaadTheGlad#9716: *gasp*
 DrNukeLear#2414: It’s ||a surprise||.
 SaadTheGlad#9716: i knew it, mark lie
 SaadTheGlad#9716: wat's the theme then huh?
 DrNukeLear#2414: Gotta do a Clone Jam first.
 Mark Brown#6982: I won't be participating in the GMTK jam because I already know the theme, I have a lot of other responsibilities, and the focus is always squarely on the community 😄
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I see Shadow, the Mr ~~manager~~ leader of an 11 person team. How are you? :)
 yumaikas#3530: There could be Mark clones for facilitation and judging
 Princent Vice#4280: Seems difficult to participate, facilitate, and judge all at once
 yumaikas#3530:  Given that you've had some practice, do you plan on jamming this year?
 baz_geluk9#9978: maybe an idea to pin this message
 SaadTheGlad#9716: wassup mark, I still remember the "mario with gun: fortnite" msg from last year
 yumaikas#3530: 👋
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: yee
 SaadTheGlad#9716: Ooh nice, I do all sorts of stuff on the channel, you may find something you like :)
 Mark Brown#6982: yo
 SixGames#0399: hey mark
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: ooh I play piano too
 SaadTheGlad#9716: Messed up link
 SaadTheGlad#9716: Here it is, pls mods I come in peace
 caibi#2508: why delete
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: just don't spam it
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: yeah you can
 SaadTheGlad#9716: Can I share it here? Idk if it's allowed :P
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: what's your channel
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: but just looks like different times for ppl
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: it still releases the video at the same time...
 SaadTheGlad#9716: *cough cough* there's also a devlog made *cough cough*
 caibi#2508: ppl are in diffrent timezone,what if someone already know the theme and tell other dont know the them yet
 SaadTheGlad#9716: Nicee, I'm working on a new game too, procedurally generated and I have a solid idea for the premise for a change
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: It's going! Been doing more Jams and I just started a long term project. Hbu?
 PepperTroopa#4091: est i believe
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: GMT?
 PepperTroopa#4091: tomorrow at 2
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: when is the theme announced again?
 SaadTheGlad#9716: Hey bro! How's your game dev journey going?
 caibi#2508: Brownies
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Lol
 SaadTheGlad#9716: Check your cords people
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Lmao
 SaadTheGlad#9716: Just wanted to share this, I thought I had a bug where my player moved left for some reason, so I restarted Unity (and since it takes a long time to reload I was pissed) But then it turns out that my mic cord was just pulling on my controller's left stick.
 BadPiggy#5202: Yo
If my computer agrees to work then yes lol
 theChief#0001: I used to moderate gdfc and gd101 too, but needed to cut back xD I'm fairly recognisable because I'm so _active_ on all the servers I join lol
 BadPiggy#5202: Oink
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Bye
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: bye
 PepperTroopa#4091: hellooo
 dardasaba#9759: Same
 Jeker#3389: not yet
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: unity is jumpscaring you?
 Jeker#3389: dude i have to like, press continue every time it encounters an error, this feels like fucking fnaf gameplay
 Jeker#3389: nope, nevermind
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: windows fireball
 Jeker#3389: i think i fixed it
 Tameno#0647: oh it's fine, you weren't annoying,
besides if anyone's to blame it's past me for ***changing their nickname to everyone in every server they're in because they think it's funny***
 ConstantDerivative#6302: i hate windows firewall
 Jeker#3389: eh, allowing an app to get through the firewall shouldnt be that hard
 Yollie#2239: If it’s that much hassle just stick with the old version....
 Jeker#3389: apparently its a...windows fire wall thing???
 Yollie#2239: That’s a surprisingly low amount I was expecting you to say that i undershot
 DrNukeLear#2414: “everyone is typing”
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: those pings must've been so annoying
 Jeker#3389: dude why the hell is no one having the errors i am having?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: OH DEAR GOD I'M SORRY LMAO
 theChief#0001: Only two big ones, then gdb is a really nice size. Budding Devs is small, and that's all I mod at the minute!
 DrNukeLear#2414: Enjoy it while it lasts, my kids are 12 and 4 years old. It’s still amazing, but different.
 Tameno#0647: why did past me decide that it would be funny to change my nickname to everyone 🤦
 Princent Vice#4280: Lol I’m receiving a steam deck today and I intend to use it for the jam if I can get it all setup tonight
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i have to wonder how you're going to see this when the jam starts in a day or so?
 Tapu#9161: Good thing I tried out Godot today, apparently I have to install stuff separately to build exe and html
 SeanSS#0892: Imagine having a stable and happy family with kids couldn't be me
 Yollie#2239: Bruh moderating like 7 big game dev servers must be the biggest flex ever
 Jeker#3389: Personal note: **Dont update your stuff like 1 day before a jam, do it at least 2, you donkey**
 theChief#0001: Yep, it's pretty good - I live in the same city as sumo digital, the gamedev scene is pretty active here!
I used to sleep, then my baby hit 4 months old and now I don't 😉
 ConstantDerivative#6302: haha what is sleep
 Yollie#2239: 1) you guys have a *local game dev meetup?*
2) do you.... sleep?
 swarm#1128: I say eetcheyo, with a french accent
 SeanSS#0892: Imagine going outside couldnt be me
 BetaFruit#2804: hypertext transfer protocol secure colon slash slash double u double u double u dot itch do eye oh
 theChief#0001: Don't forget the full time job and the fact that I help out at church and have a little community that meets every Tuesday
I need to start going to the local game dev meetup too 😂
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i call it "Place video game make good"
 Redline#7370: hmm
 BetaFruit#2804: double u double u double u dot itch do eye oh
 snuffysam#2767: for reference i say itch dot eye oh
i met one person who said itchy-oh and it rocked me to my core
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i just call it itch because it's satisfying to say
 ConstantDerivative#6302: itch dot eye oh
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: itch-eye-oh
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: QUICK EVERYONE START THE RUBE-GOLDBERG MACHINE WE MADE TO OVERTAKE THE MOD TEAM
 snuffysam#2767: here's a question for y'all
do you say itch dot eye oh or do you say itchy-oh
 SeanSS#0892: Mods gone lets riot
 SlamBamActionman#7160: I do not want to be interupted in the middle of Terraforming Mars
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Okay I gotta go clean my apartment so you all behave now
 caibi#2508: nothing
 caibi#2508: everyone is out
 SeanSS#0892: Bro why did you ping me
 vell#4314: Hey bad piggy nice to see you here
Are you joining this ?
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: it's not wrong
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: mods and admins can disable the use of certain @s like @everyone and @here cause letting these be a thing based on just Trusting that people won't do it will not work
 Jeker#3389: Ah yes "Installation Failed: Installation Failed" thank you unity
 caibi#2508: Mark scared me again
 SlamBamActionman#7160: i'm outta here
 SlamBamActionman#7160: ah shoot it's the feds
 caibi#2508: 
 SlamBamActionman#7160: ez vid
 SlamBamActionman#7160: I'll just use that AI text thing and Dall-E for visuals
 SeanSS#0892: Imagine being banned
Couldnt be me
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: ah shucks i hate when i get banned. being banned sucks
 swarm#1128: the burden of making the next video is on you now, and don't forget to thank Mark for his support
 Princent Vice#4280: RIP
 SlamBamActionman#7160: *bonk*
 SlamBamActionman#7160: ah shoot now im gonna have to ban you sorry rules b rules bai
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: this isn't the mod team's first rodeo
 JQ2#4402: Everyone whose name is Mark has questions now
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: eh. look. @everyone. nothing happens because the mods Prooobably thought of random people trying to @ everyone randomly
 SlamBamActionman#7160: YOU WENT TO BED
 Merus#7019: this is absolute payback for a joke I'd been making earlier
 caibi#2508: I’ma never try it,~~ if I get banned I will say you let me do it~~
 SlamBamActionman#7160: If you wonder about Adam, he has been deleted
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: WHAT
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: this is going to be learning by doing
 SeanSS#0892: Lmao
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: go on, try to @ everyone yourself
 caibi#2508: ~~
I will~~
 caibi#2508: mods can forgo us easily
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Good night Merus! ❤️
 ConstantDerivative#6302: is mark gonna @ everyone 24 hours before the jam
 Merus#7019: anyway best of luck moderating the hordes on your own, Slam! good night!
 SeanSS#0892: The second coup:
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: all i'm saying is that the age of darkness is soon to happen.
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: I think I've figured out what's going to cause _this_ year's permissions snafu
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: hey this is unrelated but anyone remember how in dark souls the structures of power that were slowly became smaller and smaller? going from gods, to kings, to measly human lords? this is completely unrelated btw.
 caibi#2508: Kill the goose that lays the golden egg?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Actually can I...
 Merus#7019: oh thank god I'm finally free
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: ***screeeeeeeeeeeeee***
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: perfect
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Dw everyone I fixed things
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: we are just pawns in the game of mods 😔
 Yollie#2239: Now guys, ever heard of the story of the golden goose? Mark is the golden goose in this case, blessing us with cool videos every month or so. and if you guys know how that story went you will know that if you dissect the golden goose there is a ton more golden eggs inside!
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: you start to feel a well designed laser honing in onto you
 Merus#7019: chat is always mods chat room
 caibi#2508: chat became mods chat room
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: oh sure... ~~you think mark is the original Mark~~ I mean... this server is great and nothing exciting ever happened
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: mark keeps eating us because there's a prophecy about one of the mods overthrowing him
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: It's more of a cronus and the olympian gods situation
 Merus#7019: well, there will be. Mark has an audience hungry for... game architecture, let's say
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: awesome this server comes with lore
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: We don't talk about the before times
 Yollie#2239: I seriously don’t understand how you can simultaneously moderate like 6 servers AND take care of a kid AND have a wife AND make a game at the same time
 SeanSS#0892: This implies that there was more than one
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: did the new mods hatch from the old mods like athena birthed from zeus' head?
 Merus#7019: Adam was responsible for the first coup
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: no you don't.
 SlamBamActionman#7160: what other mods
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: no.
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: haha remember the other mods?
 SeanSS#0892: I am gus fring
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: every person is gus fring if you think about it
 SlamBamActionman#7160: That is one of the actor's characters, though that's not who he is playing in the video the images above are from
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: Gus Fring...
 Lawn#1538: Which version?
 SeanSS#0892: At least we have AM2R
 swarm#1128: samus returns we see you 👀
 Jeker#3389: aaand unity wont bloody update
 SeanSS#0892: I typically hate remasters that makes pixel art games into 3d or 2.5d, I wish more games took the octopath traveller approach
Link's awakening remake has a fire art direction doe
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: the top part i guess? mario's leg covering the m? and if you squint the "E" looks like an "i"???????
 SlamBamActionman#7160: I see no ambiguity about the cover whatsoever
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Feel free to explain what you mean with this
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: the original's art is so good. honestly a masterwork and the perfect example of simplicity meeting with cool aesthetic
 caibi#2508: the cover
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Um, what?
 caibi#2508: I thought that was a n-word
 SeanSS#0892: Ima sucker for pixel art so I think ima stick with the og for now
 swarm#1128: That translation to 2.5D looks just so weird if you have played the original. Looks like a different game
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Lol naw I'm not *that* old. I'm not even the original moderator.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: legitimately thought this said "hey i'm new here. what's up". i'm pretty sure you're the least new here aside from mark
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Hey I'm here now, whaddup
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: pdf on how to add a game on itch and jink it to a game jam
 SeanSS#0892: O shit cave story has a 3ds port
 BadPiggy#5202: Da what ?
 SeanSS#0892: Ima procrastinate and make it tommorrow
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: ok I am FINALLY making my itch.i upload sheet that I should have made forever ago
 SeanSS#0892: Ive heard
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: cave story is VERY good, it's a cult classic and grandparent of indie games for a reason
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: so mechanically it plays similar to stuff like metroid but the structure itself doesn't make it a metroidvania cause its so linear
 SeanSS#0892: Sounds like my kind of game, I'll try it after the jam
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: it's a platformer with action elements
 BadPiggy#5202: Not really. Very linear, but very well designed and fun
Okay, not too linear either tbh. It's a good mix
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: nah
 SeanSS#0892: Is it a metroidvania?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: there's an item you can get to unlock it
 BadPiggy#5202: Huh. I don't remember this tbh. I'ma replay after the jam
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: it's not needed to get the whole experience imo
 SeanSS#0892: Well since the og is free I guess it wont work if I'd give it a try
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: and curly mode, which eh. it's fine
 BadPiggy#5202: One or two lines of dialogue and the graphical style is a little more detailed.
Otherwise though, same game
Though maybe a little added content. I don't think I played it
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: that too, honestly. the original had a lot of heart
 SeanSS#0892: What did they change with the remake?
 BadPiggy#5202: I love the graphical style of the original more lol
Low Rez graphics ftw
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i hear people say that the original version is better even if it doesn't have curly story mode, because the people who handled the remakes aren't the best
 SeanSS#0892: How much?
 BadPiggy#5202: Cave story+ is payed and has more detailed graphics
The only real difference is graphics tbh
And some of the dialogue
 BadPiggy#5202: The original version is
 SeanSS#0892: Cave story's free?
 swarm#1128: I remember when I played it I couldn't believe the game was free lol. I expected to play a small 30mn indie game
 BadPiggy#5202: My only problem with it is that they leave a lot to assumptions in the secret ending, while the good ending kinda answers all the questions you probably had in the end.
But still, easily one of my fav games ever
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: yeah it's quite a bit linear, i guess they see the surface level similarities in game play (which, the game is absolutely inspired by) but that doesn't make it a metroidvania because metroidvanias as a genre are defined by underlying structure they share
 swarm#1128: I guess I agree the secret ending doesn't do anything special compared to the amount of effort to get it
 BadPiggy#5202: Idk why people call cave story a metroidvania though. It's technically more of a linear action adventure
Which is probably why I loved it
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: yeah the secret ending is probably the best lmao
 BadPiggy#5202: Yes
 swarm#1128: I don't remember the endings, but don't you ||keep the island from crashing|| with the secret ending?
 BadPiggy#5202: I imagine it's satisfying to beat lol
But that's not what I meant
I meant that story-wise, the good ending felt better than the secret one lol
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i just did that recently actually and i have some pointers if you need em, it's super satisfying to get it at the end
 theChief#0001: actually I'm going for true ending plus, I've only got to get mod for one more 5k+ member count game dev server
 BadPiggy#5202: Irony of all that is that the normal good ending is actually more satisfying than the secret ending lol
 swarm#1128: Ah yeah, literal hell. I had the most trouble on the boss and i beat by pure chance
 BadPiggy#5202: Aye bruh. That jump doesn't matter. I can speed run that section lol
I can't make it past that final guantlet lol
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Yknow the only annoying part of drawing pfp's of people is that I have to actually write down somewhere and pray to the gods I did not forget someone
 swarm#1128: just don't miss the jump 👽
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: I'm just waiting for a mod to notice this bullshit and immediately ban the patrons on principle
 Yollie#2239: its not, which is why he had to make so many games
 BadPiggy#5202: As long as it's easier to get than cave story's true ending lol
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: True ending = best ending
 Yollie#2239: bruh theChief be aiming for the moderation true ending
 Yollie#2239: mark: metal gear ray, since hes big and intimidating but still the tutorial boss
 theChief#0001: but only slam if you get the secret ending, you have to beat all the bosses a second time (but at mario kart, not in hand-to-hand combat)
 Yollie#2239: now i want to make a game about this
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: he;s the one you fight repeatedly until you get there and he's a pushover and then the you get the real shit
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: Adam and Sandra doing that "one hits hard, the other moves fast" type thing
 BadPiggy#5202: So going by what you guys are saying .....
Mark = Jetstream Sam
Slam = Senator Armstrong
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: Mark, then Adam and Sandra as a combo, and then Slam
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Mark is fake out boss
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: its fine
 theChief#0001: yeah mark is the first stage
 BadPiggy#5202: Ah got ya
Just that it sounded too formal lol
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: lol you think Mark is higher than Slam... oh my sweet summer child 😄
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yeah so was I... like a joke about being "taken out back" when you can't do your job anymore.
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: lmao
 BadPiggy#5202: You're only good at dodging bullets dude.
I think these guys are going to come at you with melee attacks
 Yollie#2239: ok ngl id want to see a boxing match between theChief and mark brown
 unityAccount#7810: DLC
 BadPiggy#5202: What does that make Mark ? The secret fight ?
 theChief#0001: I've been doing some training, we'll see how it pays off
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Slam is the final boss
 BadPiggy#5202: I know lol
I was joking about the mods being literally terminated XD
 Yollie#2239: Duel of fates between theChief and Mark Brown - moderator of all vs a guy named mark
 SeanSS#0892: They send a hitman to your house
 DrNukeLear#2414: 😵
 Merus#7019: lol I never signed
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yeah you sign a contract when you become a helper and when your usefulness is finished....
 BadPiggy#5202: Oh right. We only get YEET-ed from the server a week after the jam rating period lol
 DrNukeLear#2414: Nah - after the Jam. It's a 48 hour Jam.
 Basky#7894: hello
 Merus#7019: true
 theChief#0001: nah don't worry about it - mark won't be able to defeat me 🙂
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I think you mean like 2 weeks lol
 SeanSS#0892: Its fine we just all collectively went to get the milk
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: It's the same as the non-patreons really. You're still part of the server but you can't access any channels. We would still be here but we wouldn't have mod capabilities
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Guess I just have to hope I don't miss anyone when I start drawing XD
 SeanSS#0892: They just went to go get the milk
 DrNukeLear#2414: I'm sorry . You've only got three days left.
 caibi#2508: Actually, mod helpers will be **terminated** after the jam. So you can say there’s only three actual mods
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: no idea like 15 or something
 Yollie#2239: That would be hard to moderate but maybe if you send the itch.io devs a few grand...?
 DrNukeLear#2414: Too obvious... Repulsion?
 BadPiggy#5202: Uh oh. Time to make a game where you YEET similar poles
 DrNukeLear#2414: I'd even advocate for giving bonus time for those who implement accessibility.
 Yollie#2239: ...his own games... maybe the theme is plagiarism?
 theChief#0001: developing...
wait
 Yollie#2239: anyways jam games are just meant to be proof of concepts for the most part right
 BadPiggy#5202: So peeps. For one of the GMTK jams where the theme was " dual purpose design ", Mark got the idea for the theme because of downwell and because he made a video of it a bit before the jam
What are some of the recent videos which Mark has made where he could get a theme from ?
 Yollie#2239: i would disagree since it takes time and ~~im lazy~~ i mean you can fit more into a jam game with more time
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: totally unrelated question but how many mods and mod helpers are there?
 DrNukeLear#2414: I think that should be standard in Game Jams
 theChief#0001: that wouldn't be a bad call - I think "accessibility" would have to be a rating category, with some guidelines like "save your 5 star ratings for people who really go above and beyond!"
 caibi#2508: hmmmm….
 BadPiggy#5202: Lol. I don't think it was this
 DrNukeLear#2414: Sign me up. Right now!
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: This talk about accessibilty atm reminds me I need to, whenever I get to it, make sure that my story game allows for people to have the text spoken.
 Yollie#2239: which jam was that.... mini jam? I cant remember but that is GENIUS LMAO
 caibi#2508: bruh
 BadPiggy#5202: I remember the theme for a jam being " empty "
Someone submitted a blank Unity project
Then ended up coming first in terms of theme
 Yollie#2239: extra points for more accessibility options maybe? I know someone called ericbomb who makes audio games for blind people
 theChief#0001: I've done this before, yeah!
 caibi#2508: made a TTS in unity sounds cool
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Giving time to research it and the recommended accessibility options etc sounds great
 caibi#2508: like this jam idea
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: that sounds really cool
 caibi#2508: OHHH
 Yollie#2239: oh lol way ahead of me
 theChief#0001: I might do it so it's
**Accessibility jam: Hand Tremors**
Theme: some standard theme, idk lets say "power" for now
that would mean you can do some research beforehand about the specific type of disability and how it affects people playing games
 Yollie#2239: Im not really a big fan of that idea since you can make so many games out of that, how about also adding a second maybe optional theme which is like a regular game jam theme
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I mean it probably already exists, there are hame jams for everything
 BadPiggy#5202: Recursive jam
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: that sounds awesome
 SeanSS#0892: When will there be a jam about hosting game jams 🤔
 BadPiggy#5202: For men may come and men may go
But game jams will be around forever
 Jeker#3389: i activley hate doing that lol
 caibi#2508: ~~must be the real theme~~
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Yeah we're just over a day out, remember there's some resources pinned above that you might find useful.
I would very much recommend you update your computer and any software you want to use.
Make a project with just a moving square. export it, upload it to itch and test it. You don't want to be learning how to do that in the middle of the jam
 Yollie#2239: ~~yes exactly you heard it first hand from a moderator and yep that is the theme mhm~~
 Yollie#2239: for the next 8 years theyll definitely always be a jam because decade jam exist
 theChief#0001: the stuff I'm talking about now is not related to GMTK
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: i just checked the 'in progress' page for itch jams and there's 198
 caibi#2508: so the theme in next time is accessibility jam!?
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: That's a lovely idea, not sure how hard it would be but it's something special.
 SeanSS#0892: So its like you're given a unity project and you make a warioware style minigame with it? Sounds fun
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: there's probably no less than 100
 theChief#0001: but it will be hard to do the copy for the jam page, I think
 theChief#0001: not sure! We were toying with the idea of an accessibility jam, where the theme is a way to improve your game for people with a specific disability. E.g. it might be "hand tremors" so you'd have to figure out how to make a game that can be played by people with hand tremors
 Jeker#3389: oh boy, time to update unity again
 Yollie#2239: NO WAy that seems so cool
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: The idea is you get a unity template with a couple of scripts that you hook into, and each entry is a warioware-style minigame.
If you use the scripts provided, the game will run as warioware and load/unload each entry as a minigame. So after everything is submitted, there's a whole bunch of minigames!
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: there's always a game jam happening somewhere
 SeanSS#0892: Whats the warioware jam about? Im interested 👀
 theChief#0001: yeah 😁
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: like he specifically said it's not recommended to use it yet so if you are going to try you'll have to expect some bugs or some imperfections
 SeanSS#0892: Ooooo warioware
 Yollie#2239: join that server he moderates... wait
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: Don't forget the Unity Warioware jam next spring 👀
 Yollie#2239: whats the topic gonna be?
 caibi#2508: sory I didn’t saw it
 theChief#0001: of course there'll be another GDB jam, just not another juice jam lol
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: where can I sign up for this thing :D -jk mental health shit... eughhhh-
 Yollie#2239: wait so theres not another game dev bois jam this year?
 theChief#0001: planning on doing it yearly, the first one went really well considering that it was my first major jam xD 1,500 joins, 300 entries 🙂
 Yollie#2239: soon he shall take over the world
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Yeah when you say that keep in mind that Dotwo *just* said A. it;s not finished yet and B. they haven't got a good way to decorate the UI yet
 caibi#2508: no stars, sad. It’s nice if the… UI can better.
 theChief#0001: next one will be january some time!
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: ou must tell me when juice jam is on I'm super interested in the concept of that one
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: The API side is pretty flexible between game jams, but we haven't settled on how exactly to handle the UI for other jams
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: you're certainly busy. :3
 theChief#0001: and maybe bullet hell jam, I think I've taken over that one now too
 theChief#0001: oh amazing, I didn't realise it was open source! Definitely stealing it for juice jam ❤️
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Not yet I don't think as its not finished you;d have to ask Dotwo
 Lawn#1538: But the website is open source right?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: At the moment the team finder is only ^ yeah that
 Pixelwarp#2471: k
 Lawn#1538: It’s only for *this* game jam yes.
 Pixelwarp#2471: And also is the teamfinder only for game jams?
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: *watches chat silently*
 Redline#7370: demo version bruh
 Pixelwarp#2471: thank you for your help
 Lawn#1538: UTC+2 is CEST. Just use that in the team finder.
 Redline#7370: it's not even a good test, you'd go better off doing timespy or smth
 Pixelwarp#2471: hm yeah that's right
 Lawn#1538: What do you mean Google? We’re talking about the team finder.
 caibi#2508: for testing(
 RiverDog#8199: i put a gtx1080 in a computer i build a decade ago and it worked, that old asus mother board is legendary.  though my pc couldn't handle some of the new ram to full capacity
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: that's memory bandwidth constrained and not representative of most real gpu tasks
 Redline#7370: why would you mine anything when the crypto market is crashing like crazy
 MrBen#0001: lmao this dude from forum:
Pure DENIAL ! An empty project is always 153mb . No answer at all, no tutorial, just links to other threads, where you can find zero solution… Ah yes, there is the mystical “blacklist.txt” solution, wich doesnt work (the empty project remains 153mb), wich you must be a soothsayer to use, because you cant find any tutorial…
You just can’t make android/ios games with this engine.
You spent 50 hours to make a superb mini-game ? Just put it in the trash, you will not be able to sell it, never.
 caibi#2508: I will mine coins if I have a good GPU to test the ”performance” of the GPU
 Pixelwarp#2471: google
 Lawn#1538: Where are you seeing 5am?
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: if you have a desktop - any desktop - you're enthusiast class
 Redline#7370: how does that have to do with anything, but nothing
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: also objectively the 'normal' pc user is using a laptop with no discrete gpu
 caibi#2508: wat coin you are mining
 Pixelwarp#2471: Denmark
 Lawn#1538: What country are you in?
 Redline#7370: well, you bought it at the wrong time, I got mine for 150EUR and it was a 1650s not normal 1650
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: does any normal person also buy a new gpu every year
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: i would be willing to bet there are dozens of people here using 750s or worse lol
 swarm#1128: I bought my 1650 250€ which is expensive for many people
 gamedevperson#8448: oh alr
 caibi#2508: I don’t have VR glasses, so no
 Redline#7370: that sometimes is never, like it's half the speed of a gtx 1650 which is basically the lowest any normal person would go
 gamedevperson#8448: VR ver?
 DrNukeLear#2414: Hello there
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Hello.
 Pixelwarp#2471: it says it's 5 in the morning but it's not
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: like they're selling products right now where the only drivers are officially beta
 DrNukeLear#2414: You’ll never get the performance of a top tier GPU, but it’s sometimes better than a low tier GPU.
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: though you can now go out and buy a dedicated intel gpu and the driver situation there is not any better
 caibi#2508: I still can play CSGO on 70+ fps, no man’s sky on 27- fps
 Pixelwarp#2471: oh k
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: intel drivers are just bad
 Lawn#1538: That’s just UTC 2+
 Redline#7370: *intel ones are pretty shit not gonna lie*
 MrBen#0001: Me: deletes 1 kb file in unreal engine build
Also Me: Turns on the game
Unreal Engine: CDO CONSTRUCTOR CANVAS FAILDED TO FIND x 100
 DrNukeLear#2414: Modern integrated chips aren’t bad if you have fast ram.
 Pixelwarp#2471: CEST
 gamedevperson#8448: hru?
 Lawn#1538: What’s your time zone?
 Redline#7370: hello kind person
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: last year 9/250 were ue games
 Pixelwarp#2471: Hey so i am trying to create a post in GMTK Team Finder, but my timezone isn't listed what should i select?
 gamedevperson#8448: hello chat
 DrNukeLear#2414: Intel integrated thing afaik.
 caibi#2508: GPU in CPU
 Redline#7370: me with my power limited 1650s that only uses 35W at full load 😎
 MrBen#0001: wats that?
 Lawn#1538: Just use GMS2, Unity, or Godot like 70% of the other jammers.
 DrNukeLear#2414: Not touching it. It’s been too much hard work for indies since UE4 imho.
 MrBen#0001: (rtx 3080, ryzen 9 5950x)
 caibi#2508: never gonna use ue on bad computer — by someone use ue for once
 MrBen#0001: Why did I even install ue5
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: if you're unhappy about vs ram usage you _are not_ going to like using ue lol
 Lawn#1538: Calm down. Take your technical issues over to 
 MrBen#0001: I dont use it. Unreal engine requires it for some plugins
 caibi#2508: USE *VISUAL STUDIO CODE* WILL BETTER FOR YOU, YOU CAN USE *ATOM* TOO
 MrBen#0001: yeah 16384 k
 swarm#1128: I thought he meant disk space
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: did you buy that much ram to actually use it, or to look at task manager and obsessively make sure you don't use it
 loogi#4810: I think yellow would've been better
 swarm#1128: microsoft.jpg
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: it's installing stuff. chill
 loogi#4810: Am i the only one who doesn't like the Orange in the jam text
 MrBen#0001: CAN ANYONE EXPLAIN
 caibi#2508: ME 2
 MrBen#0001: WTF TAKES 8 GB IN VISUAL STUDIO
 Merus#7019: please do not jam in my engine, I don't know why I thought I should invent my own DSL

 Catfish#2063: who uses that anyway
 Merus#7019: it's absolute dogshit guys, I'm sorry I have to drop support
 Merus#7019: and that's my one, Merusworks v0.72
 Ibra#8468: sure
 MrBen#0001: yep
 Merus#7019: there's only one unambiguously bad engine
 Catfish#2063: well easier than cpp(sdl, opengl, vulkan)
 Ibra#8468: TypeScript makes it more bearable, but yes
 Lawn#1538: This is not the place to play good engine, bad engine. All engines are valid, what matters are the games.
 Ibra#8468: listen everyone is entitled to an opinion, but JavaScript is pain
 swarm#1128: Like many years ago you had HaxePunk which was great, but that relied on Flash
 Catfish#2063: why not just javascript, it's just easy, efficient, does the job, i am aiming at a 2d game anyway
 swarm#1128: Still >0 🤷‍♂️
 caibi#2508: game maker sucks, but cool still
 Ibra#8468: and if you're really deranged you could use JavaScript bindings for Godot
 MrBen#0001: oof
 Catfish#2063: new target acuired Get rid of him
 caibi#2508: reality engine, use eyes to render, brain to compile, it’s a high level technology
 Ibra#8468: Godot is a solid choice
 Ibra#8468: J*vaScript 🤮
 Catfish#2063: i might do the jam in javascript (or godot)
 Catfish#2063: i am not asking just panicking
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: it's 3 out of 250 games
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i didn't expect godot to elbow game maker in popularity, wow
 Lawn#1538: Take any future sdl2 questions to  please.
 MrBen#0001: what is the yellow one xD
 Catfish#2063: a solid 6% cool i thought it would be less
 MrBen#0001: it cant be
 swarm#1128: I don't understand how Haxe can be popular after flash died
 Redline#7370: hmm yes
 MrBen#0001: no
 Catfish#2063: i am having problems compiling sdl2
 caibi#2508: ~~use OpenGL and C++~~
 caibi#2508: unity has bad compile
 Catfish#2063: btw how is everyone planning to code there games, like will u be using a game engine?
 swarm#1128: Bruh, empty RPG maker project is more than that
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i'm starting to notice patterns of this place getting flooded once school time ends for the more common time zones
 MrBen#0001: bruh my content in this project is 700 kb
 Catfish#2063: godot is way better for smaller projects
 caibi#2508: delete the scene, it’s true always, 0b scene
 Lawn#1538: That’s just how Unreal is bud.
 Catfish#2063: its aimed at AAA games so..
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: this is what i mean when UE is the opposite of godot
 MrBen#0001: I need to learn how to reduce this junk
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: how would they even notice
 Catfish#2063: i made someone laugh 3 times that's cool
 caibi#2508: Just curious
 MrBen#0001: bruh
 Lawn#1538: This is oddly specific. Probably not is the answer. Why do you want to know anyway?
 Lawn#1538: Memery can live in 
 caibi#2508: haha, funny joke, hahahaha,hahahahahahahaaaaaa
 Catfish#2063: christmas summer edition dlc
 loogi#4810: Oh ok
 Lawn#1538: It’s not Christmas time yet, but it might be time out time soon.
 caibi#2508: wat? today?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: in july? that's a song
 loogi#4810: IT'S CHRISTMAS YAY
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: ohh you're asking, and don't worry about your english, it's fine
 caibi#2508: hmmm?
 Catfish#2063: dad joke
 caibi#2508: My grammar bad, sor. Do mods kick people who haven't been online for three years?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: why would they get banned? it's not like they're doing...anything?
 Catfish#2063: ×_×
 Lawn#1538: Huh?
 caibi#2508: will mod/modhelper ban people those don’t online three years?
 loogi#4810: I bet that the jame will get atleast 15 submissions
 theChief#0001: yep, that's how it goes 😂
 Lawn#1538: I’m not far behind you in the activity zone Chief. Dad life be keeping you perpetually online.
 Lawn#1538: You’re right no moustache.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I'm way more handsome than that.
 Lawn#1538: It ebbs and flows between states.
 Merus#7019: A little salty language is perfectly fine
 Merus#7019: Our hard lines are on things that put users in danger or make them feel threatened or unwelcome
 caibi#2508: oh! allowed, so I don’t need to add a spoiler to Fuck!
 Merus#7019: Fuck yeah
 caibi#2508: F word allowed?
 redve#6507: Wanna play a moving rectangle? 👉 👈
 Merus#7019: Well done!
 caibi#2508: oh my jesus!F!**THE F!**
 Redline#7370: nice?
 redve#6507: HOLY FUCK, MY DEMO WORKS
 caibi#2508: ~~So, the conclusion is that *Rick Roll* is illegal in this server.~~
 Lawn#1538: I think we were still using Netscape Navigator on our high school computers when that came out.
 DrNukeLear#2414: Oh I remember. It’d get you banned if you did it now.
 Merus#7019: Boy you don’t want to know what we did before rickrolls
 DrNukeLear#2414: Which makes you less than half my age.
 Merus#7019: I feel like this dissection of the joke is serving as warning enough
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: I remember learning about the rickroll in high school when it was first a thing 😰
 Redline#7370: just barely but still older than me
 Lawn#1538: 16 year old meme, hot damn
 DrNukeLear#2414: Well... technically it was a deceptive link.
 Frog Musk#4593: good morning or evening or night to everyone here
 Redline#7370: that is indeed true
 Merus#7019: Yeah, that’s where I’m leaning; like a rickroll is ultimately harmless but same mechanism can be used for more destructive ends
 Lawn#1538: It’s an unfunny joke that’s probably older than you.
 DrNukeLear#2414: It’ll pass into ancient message history in about 30 minutes.
 Redline#7370: it's ~~funnyyyyyyyyy~~
 Merus#7019: Trying to decide if I should delete the rickroll
 SixGames#0399: ?
 SixGames#0399: anyone here a 3D or 2D artist?
 Redline#7370: now it's at 22 views lmao
 SixGames#0399:  I sent you a friend request so we can team up
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: i wonder why, art is more fun than programming imo (having done both a lot)
 Catfish#2063: Maybe search for an old friend, everyone know that one girl who is sick at drawing
 Yamam#4861: Yeah, it's like 90% programmers
 Martin111#0333: you menace
 swarm#1128: There are more programmers than artists from what I've seen
 Redline#7370: the funny thing is that I know that 12 people visited the site xD
 Yamam#4861: I searched all team finder artist and everyone is booked
 Martin111#0333: damnit
 Yamam#4861: Am I the only one who's really struggling to find a 2d artist for the jam?
 redve#6507: ~~I stole it for a private server for my team which i will make game with~~
 redve#6507: You have really nice gmtk logo, ngl
 theChief#0001: yep! 🙂 here are some instructions with screenshots!
 George007#4297: is it easy to upload ur game
 theChief#0001: 
 George007#4297: anyone hyped??
 MrBen#0001: wow
 theChief#0001: it will be released when the countdown on the itch page ends: 
 sivavarun#6092: Hey guys anyone timing when  the theme gamejam theme will be released
 MrBen#0001: wow u can add custom cursor on itch
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: the game of the last jam i partecipated in got 44 views and 15 downloads - guess it's only natural considering it's a game you have to download
 R2D2Vader#0693: XD
 R2D2Vader#0693: 😛
 MrBen#0001: wow look my itchio page is booming 😜
 MrBen#0001: 12
Views
 redve#6507: Ok, time to watch older gmtk results to ~~steal ideas~~ inspirate
 redve#6507: I have an unique idea for a game, you will shot to move
 DrNukeLear#2414: I’m building an Indie game myself at the moment and while me and my collaborator build towards a vertical slice we’re getting advice based on YouTube recordings of test gameplay.
 caibi#2508: Ah, I absolutely need a deeper plan for it
 DrNukeLear#2414: And this, as soon as you have a vertical slice present that slice to players.
 theChief#0001: right from the beginning
 theChief#0001: make sure you get it in front of actual players as soon as possible! If you want to sell it, you **need** a __target market__. Basically, who are the people that will really love your game? Target _them_, make sure you know what _they_ want
 DrNukeLear#2414: The absolute diamond of advice in the video is 7 minutes in. The whole video is excellent and reasoned well enough that you can generalise from it. Pure design advice that can be applied to any game imho. Which is why it’s not sent in a DM.
 DrNukeLear#2414: In fact I’m going to hunt a link to that video.
 caibi#2508: Yes, very good now, thanks for suggestions
 DrNukeLear#2414: I’m good, you?
 DrNukeLear#2414: 1) Create your own discord server for your game if you want a deeper discussion on your game design. It’ll give focus to the conversation and make it easier to keep feedback and advice together. You’d have to check with a mod or helper as to wether or not you can advertise it here.
2) Create a design brief for yourself. Writing it down will help clarify what you are making.
3) Coffee Stain Studios has a YouTube channel with an episode on things which aren’t going into satisfactory. There is a diamond of advice in there about what your game is and what your game isn’t. Jace should make a separate video on the topic.
 loogi#4810: Unintelligible
 loogi#4810: You could say your word was
 BadPiggy#5202: I used a big brain word and killed the chat.
YEET
 BadPiggy#5202: Incomprehensible
 loogi#4810: What about disconnected mess
 BadPiggy#5202: Too generic tbh.
 loogi#4810: Omg >:(
In the gmtk team finder website on mobile if you press advanced search options there's an option saying "When searching for skills you are have:" this is such a big mistake my wife has left me because of this i am dying and rotting in my cabin thinking about my final moment in a constant state of anger and depression
 AkariZero#2463: I want to say both yes and no. I worry it creates a lot of pixel art games but it could create fun game mechanic ideas such as being able to go through a room and using your memories to grab hold of objects from the past but only after you drawn enough clues to do so from other context of your memory.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: hmm... do you think nostalgia could be a good theme?
 AkariZero#2463: It is disconcerning. I would follow with a title one and if you discover a different direction over the game jam, follow it if you have time.
 tykenn#8548: True, it can definitely be more eye catching to have some big letters to read. I just hesitate because it is kind of redundant with the title right under it, and takes up a lot of space that could be used for a bigger art piece.
 AkariZero#2463: No I haven't. I think doing things like that though makes your game stands out
 MrBen#0001: I added screenshots. This reveals my pc hard drive
 MrBen#0001: lmao
 hello there#4536: You ever played superhot mcd?
Thus games splashscreen legit was a cartridge and is like the coolest thing I've ever seen
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: page design is important to get your game in the radar honestly
 AkariZero#2463: I think it's a good idea because it gives  your cover art kind of a "video game cartiage" feel
 MrBen#0001: I literally speedrunned it in 30 secs
 hello there#4536: lmao nice
 theChief#0001: you don't _have_ to, but in my experience it is best to do it
 MrBen#0001: ye
 hello there#4536: Is that lorem ipsum without the "lorem ipsum dolor sit amet"part?
 tykenn#8548: Do you all generally like to put the title in the cover art or no? I'm kind of torn on the idea.
 theChief#0001: this will give you all the sizes for images you can upload, and a bit of info about what each one is used for
 theChief#0001: nah that's nicer than a lot of pages people make during a jam 😂
 AkariZero#2463: what gives you life is the question
 Peshoddd#9446: do you know a game that can give my life back cuz hellfiler took it
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i'd rather die than be asked to choose to do the one thing -u-
 theChief#0001: for astroline it was just a decent font, rendered three times and slightly rotated lol
 theChief#0001: (don't include polyfury, that's my main project that I've paid to get assets for lol)
 AkariZero#2463: *is a better programmer than other things >w>*
 AkariZero#2463: how good? I'm always looking for more pixel artists in the future!
 wren#0640: im a better pixel artist than programmer but if im not just working in spritesheets i will die
 theChief#0001: having decent screenshots is also pretty important, you can browse all the screenshots added to the jam to figure out which games look fun
 BadPiggy#5202: Best thing is to just do a cover gif of the game then
 wren#0640: i think cover image art is like easily my weakest point tbh
 theChief#0001: both of these will be shown EVERYWHERE
 theChief#0001: the most important two things are your cover image and your short description
 AkariZero#2463: Thanks! How much do you say the page offers in terms of a success of getting a game played on itch.io?
 theChief#0001: yep!
 AkariZero#2463: *raise hand* Can you give permission to your team mates to edit the layout and design of the page?
 theChief#0001: from there you just fill everything in 🙂 you can edit the page once you've saved it
 MrBen#0001: oh ok
 MrBen#0001: I dont even know how to start lol
 theChief#0001: what is it you're struggling with?
 MrBen#0001: like I dont even know how to use the default one
 MrBen#0001: how do I use it?
 JuliusCube#8501: idk but that is a weirdly creative story for a dream
 MrBen#0001: wat-
 JuliusCube#8501: bro i have dreams where my friend buys a radioactive laser gun, we go to a bathroom in a forest, he makes a solid rocket booster somehow, and my other friend uses it to get to space
 caibi#2508: use the tool
 MrBen#0001: Anyone can help me with itch page?
 caibi#2508: oh yess baby, 1day 7hours left.
 MrBen#0001: I have dreams with black space
 AkariZero#2463: or weekends where I thought I was suppose to go to work
 JuliusCube#8501: thats not *that* bad
 AkariZero#2463: I had horrible dreams like that before but it was me waking up thinking I had a final in 2 hours
 JuliusCube#8501: for some reason i thought it was the 15th and that the jam was going to start today
 MrBen#0001: Im calling him Plushie idk 👀
 MrBen#0001: :/
 Phallo#3476: 😿
 MrBen#0001: I cant send pics :/
 AkariZero#2463: I demand a cat!
 Heimvana#7189: I demand cat pictures
 MrBen#0001: He's so little
 AkariZero#2463: I'm flipping through a few different shows at the moment. I need to finish Vox Machina
 yugioh#7402: I love adventure time tbh
 MrBen#0001: and regular show at the same time. I actualy watching both lmao
 MrBen#0001: ok time to stop watching adventure time
 Henry_Hamster#4240: imma go touch grass for the first time in years
 MrBen#0001: NO Now YOU will win the gamejam with my secret :/
 MrBen#0001: e
 AkariZero#2463: well my groceries I mean delivered to me
 Henry_Hamster#4240: I ran out of cookies a while ago, you people just reminded me to go buy some thank you :DDDD
 AkariZero#2463: I'm having my food delivered to me the day of the jam.
 MrBen#0001: 'eat well, sleep well'
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: but potato soup is crucial for jams!!
 MrBen#0001: I am going to the store
 AkariZero#2463: shoot. I forgot to buy potato soup for the game jam
 MrBen#0001:
 AkariZero#2463: one of my favorite show about just being random but actually having weight
 MrBen#0001: I have it on 1 monitor and I chat on discord on other lol
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: everybody who ever build unity webgl knows the pain of it
 MrBen#0001: lmao it's so good
 AkariZero#2463: Ahh a classic.
 yugioh#7402: Good night sweet dreams maven
 Henry_Hamster#4240: I don't normally either, I just chill
 M_Raven#4076: Literally 5:50 am here
 AkariZero#2463: Night night Maven. I'm about to bake some cheddar drop biscuits for the Game Jam
 MrBen#0001: oof I didnt do anything for the day before jam
 Henry_Hamster#4240: Good night, you need the sleep, you've been awake forever
 M_Raven#4076: ironically I am about to go to sleep, so good night everyone
 AkariZero#2463: almost time for the game jam 😄 I'm super excited.
 M_Raven#4076: 👋
 yugioh#7402: Morning
 MrBen#0001: evening
 AkariZero#2463: morning everyone
 yugioh#7402: Best friend remix with jamie and chanmina
 MrBen#0001: 👏 e 👏  e 👏
 yugioh#7402: Reeeeeeeee
 MrBen#0001: 👏
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: e
 M_Raven#4076: Good to hear 👍
 MrBen#0001: e
 M_Raven#4076: Well have you?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: have you searched yourself?
 MrBen#0001: yeah ik ik lol. I'm just dumb
- adding your art assets and sounds
- adding "game feel" bits, like screen shake and particle effects
- fixing bugs
- putting in a title screen and settings menu
- adding a "quit" button
that sort of thing!
 MrBen#0001: 🤨
 M_Raven#4076: Have you searched through the deepest crevices of heaven and hell
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: no it was in my room under a box that kinda floats
 yugioh#7402: Have you searched your usb ports
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: where did I put my usb flash drive again?
 yugioh#7402: The pre sequel to the spinoff
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: true
maybe you did
 MrBen#0001: oh nvm I thought about a Country
 theChief#0001: damn sequel be looking like a made up word now
 yugioh#7402: Oh yeah i remember that borderlands game lol what were they thinking in the avgn voice
 MrBen#0001: what's the 'Polish' in the day 2 xD
 theChief#0001: have they not already done it? 😂 I was actually referencing the borderlands pre-sequel, the third game that places in-between the first and second entries xD
 JuliusCube#8501: become the presequel to the spinoff
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: no become the sequel to the prequel
 yugioh#7402: That's sounds like a thing kingdom hearts will do
 M_Raven#4076: The spinoff
 theChief#0001: *pre-sequel
 MrBen#0001: yep
 MrBen#0001: *sequel that's actualy a prequel
 M_Raven#4076: The *prequel*
 JuliusCube#8501: no, become the sequel
 MrBen#0001: wdym?
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: just almost finished the "day before" in gamejam survival list
 yugioh#7402: 🫂 🫂 🫂
 yugioh#7402: Damn that's sounds like heaven
 M_Raven#4076: Nah, become the game itself
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i'm just over here enjoying my life after a 4 exam semester listening to the most sappy vocaloid stuff possible while practicing fighting games. life could not be better
 Tapu#9161: Become a dlc
 yugioh#7402: Watching my life in gaming
 yugioh#7402: It's 12pm and I'm postponing translating
 theChief#0001: I need a nap
 theChief#0001: I was up at 2:50am this morning 👍
 M_Raven#4076: Which I am not going to do
 MrBen#0001: yeah ik
 M_Raven#4076: I was going to tell you to get back to work but then I realized I need to go to sleep
 theChief#0001: I'm actually working
 theChief#0001: I mean
 theChief#0001: it's actually 10:37 and I'm pretending to work
 M_Raven#4076: me omw to kill timezones
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: time zones aren't real 🙂
 theChief#0001: 
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i dont know what you're talking about it's 11:36 and i'm practicing guilty gear combos
 M_Raven#4076: It's 5:30 in the morning and I'm headbanging to metal in my swivel chair in my room illuminated only by my monitor and a desk lamp
 theChief#0001: there is an option to skip, or "reshuffle", yeah! You won't be blocked if you come up against a game you can't play 🙂
 Casper#6361: Oh you even do a recording, I just stick to paragraph or two with feedback
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i'll try to rate as many as i can this time around
 Tornado#0975: i think ill just solo this jam
 theChief#0001: I actually don't often have time to play and rate all that many  but that's because I tend to leave a few paragraphs of feedback plus a recording of me playing the game...
 Tapu#9161: There's option to skip right?
 theChief#0001: if you didn't submit a game to the jam, you have to rate I think 25 random games before being able to rate things you choose!
 Casper#6361: Also itch does a great job at combatting rigged votes
 M_Raven#4076: I'll make it one
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: with 18k people partecipating i actually think the risk of rigging might be mitigated
 theChief#0001: don't worry about your score or final place, it's not actually a competition 🙂
 M_Raven#4076: Anyone can, you just can't rate your own game
 theChief#0001: actually, I think it's also open to the public
 theChief#0001: as in, everyone taking part
 theChief#0001: us!
 MrBen#0001: btw who rates the games?
 Casper#6361: Honestly the rating process is just as fun as making the game for me
 yugioh#7402: Cool
 Casper#6361: Very true
 yugioh#7402: Hello is that smiling friends in your pfp
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: lemon...
 theChief#0001: weary lemon is one of my favourite emoji
 Henry_Hamster#4240: True, but it doesnt help for the ratings if its like constant failing in my opinion, at least not for enjoyment
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: lemon...?
 M_Raven#4076: I think the biggest issue is simply that I didn't playtest lmao
 theChief#0001: I think if my game involves a game over state, I might do something like a rolling feed of death messages for every player so you can see how often everyone is dying 😂
 Casper#6361: Most people don't mind sitting through a little bit of difficulty for the purpose of rating a game
 Casper#6361: Generally it's fine if as long as your first game is not a roguelike
 MrBen#0001: hey how you doing?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: and design for that - one thing that could've helped was immediately rebooting the level instead of going straight to the main menu, cause clicking again on the level can be a bit bothersome
 Henry_Hamster#4240: and tbh it would be fine if there were like checkpoints or shorter lvels
cause every time you fail you have to spend like 20 seconds going back whihc gets annoying
 theChief#0001: first jam woes though, you'll learn all this stuff over time 😁
 theChief#0001: making hard stuff is fine - but I think you want it to be forgiving, or at least call attention to the fact that you're gonna die a lot
 M_Raven#4076: The sprite flips but not the hitbox (which is not centered)
 M_Raven#4076: The hitboxes are bugged actually, it's really noticeable in the last level
 Henry_Hamster#4240: this spike hitbox is actually really annoying, like you have to jump before you go off the ledge
 Henry_Hamster#4240: Always give people to playtest and have some expected/average result
 Casper#6361: I've had two years where my game was too challenging and one where it was too easy
 Henry_Hamster#4240: and also the spike hitboxes are not forgiving
 Casper#6361: I never got my difficulty just right
 Henry_Hamster#4240: Im still stuck on the last part of the tutorial 😭
 Henry_Hamster#4240: I can see why people said its too hard
 M_Raven#4076: Gotcha, thanks for feedback. ~~And now I'm considering remaking the game again~~
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i really like the idea, though, i think it has legs if given enough juice and with better level design
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: the tutorial level should've explained what's going on with the controls before you deploy the shadow, because a LOT of players (me included!) will just press left and be hit by the shadow immediately and go "huh? what happened"
 M_Raven#4076: I had like an hour left to submit
 M_Raven#4076: To be honest, the tutorial was very rushed
 Henry_Hamster#4240: and having to restart every time you fail is not helpful for a tutorial I would say
 M_Raven#4076: I actually did go back and remake a "parkour demo" of the game in Unity with much tighter and better-feeling controls, I'll take this into account
 Casper#6361: I haven't really made much over the past year but I like doing GMTK as a bit of a yearly event
 Henry_Hamster#4240: the end of the tutorial is actually just pain
 Casper#6361: Year 4 for me now irrc
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: right off the bat i think this immediately reminds me of neon white. the main crux of the game feels like it's supposed to be problem solving and quick thinking/reflexes, so i think what should help is 1) ease in the players into the more difficult aspects 2) give players more slack and make the perfect execution of the level a reward but not the primary goal
 M_Raven#4076: It was the first ever game jam I ever did, I'm just happy I got the top half of the leaderboard
 Casper#6361: Hello everyone
 M_Raven#4076: I know 😭
 Henry_Hamster#4240: the comments are not very promising for a good difficulty
 theChief#0001: if you've got anything that requires precise input, I highly recommend adding a little bit of aim assist and/or magnetism!
don't spend like, a lot of time on it - but you should be able to get something sorted pretty quickly. In Unity, I do a circlecast/spherecast in the input direction and snap the rotation to the first object it hits
or if it's mouse controlled I check in a radius around the mouse position and snap to the closest object to the player
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: this is one solution to the problem i guess!
 M_Raven#4076: nah just put the E keycap on your spacebar easy fix
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: also being a beginner game it had some very confusing stuff, including text that's completely outdated... the text message you get for when you get missiles is "shoot with e" but it's actually shoot with spacebar
 Henry_Hamster#4240: sure, I can check it out anyways
 M_Raven#4076: I could link the game if you want it
 M_Raven#4076: Controls were simple but you had to be very precise with all of your inputs to finish
 Henry_Hamster#4240: oh... well thats a problem then I guess, unless there is a tutorial or really intuitive mechanics
 M_Raven#4076: The curve was a plateau set to really high
 PepperBoi#4544: I made a game where I made the levels and then after I finished all the levels I added a double jump and people still say it’s hard
 M_Raven#4076: It was level-based and tbh I don't think it's hard in the context of if I were to make it a full game. I think it's more along the lines of it straight up had no difficulty curve
 Henry_Hamster#4240: Very important yeah, on my first jam I spend like 3 hours trying to export webGL D:
 PepperBoi#4544: lol all my games are too hard
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: it's a downloadable exe also because i could not manage to figure out webgl exporting in time before the deadline! This is your reminder to test out your exports before the jam starts!
 Henry_Hamster#4240: playtest until people finish it 50% of the time(assuming it ends), even if it makes the game way too easy for you
pretty annoying anyway though
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: there. itch id on my nickname if anyone wants to check it out, it's the only game in there right now
 M_Raven#4076: My last submission for GMTK I think had a solid concept that was generally fun, but it was buggy and also *stupidly fucking hard*
 M_Raven#4076: Ah
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: oh this isn't for gtmk, this was for a seven day jam for beginners to gamedev/jams
 M_Raven#4076: You say this and now I'm suddenly questioning if I met you and played your game last year or not
 macleodian#7269: I'm feeling like I I have a school paper I barely worked on due in a few hours 💀
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i think my last jam game was a really solid idea with some really cool visuals, but where it failed was the fact that it had not very good game feel
 Henry_Hamster#4240: Still working on a few last base systems before building levels and probably finally polish
 Henry_Hamster#4240: mmm I'm definitely gonna add that thank you :D.
 Phallo#3476: if it is actually a lot like polybridge you could add little things like click sounds and particles when connecting pieces and also confetti and stuff like that for when the player completes the level
 Henry_Hamster#4240: Right now I'm just not too sure how to add it to my personal project cause its supposed to be a puzzle game, the most similar thing is maybe polybridge, but by a little stretch
 Lawn#1538: Juice and sound are that icing games need to stand out 🧁
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: TY!
 Henry_Hamster#4240: here^
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: oh can i yoink those too?
 Henry_Hamster#4240: not bad, I'm watching some videos which theChief recommended about game feel, definitely something I gotta work on
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: looks like the jam'll reach 18k soon enough, how's everyone feeling?
 theChief#0001: heyo 🙂
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: morning everyone!
 M_Raven#4076: Imagine sleeping, smh
 Snage#1337: also it is 2am why am i awake, ima go to sleep, i will see yall tmr!
 theChief#0001: I find that it really does help to just jump in and start building. If I'm _really_ stuck, I'll do some menus or something first - stuff I know will need to be done for any game I make. Often that leads to some sort of idea or some way to start
 macleodian#7269: That's honestly been a bit of a problem for me, I have trouble visualizing the details of what I want, but because of that I have no idea where to start building (though when I do finally start it gets a little easier)
I sorta get stuck in the trap of making the sprites/graphics first then doing the building when I know it should be the other way around
 Snage#1337: huh, thank you! this actually gave me some good notes for something i didnt know i was confused on.
 theChief#0001: helps me actually visualise ideas, I'm not much of a planner xD I need to be able to interact with a game to decide whether or not I actually like the idea
 theChief#0001: I've done so many of these 30 min jams because I actually tend to do two or three of them at the start of a jam!
 theChief#0001: generally I play by these rules:
- have an idea before you start the timer
- open a new project in your engine before you start the timer
- use any assets you like, and _import them before you start the timer_
- don't include build times - when the timer stops, _then_ build it
 Snage#1337: honestly might try it after this jam
 theChief#0001: I highly recommend doing it! Doesn't really matter if you don't make it in time, but it's a good exercise in keeping your scope _really_ small
 Henry_Hamster#4240: Thank you, I'll try to implement maybe a little this time, no promises though...
 Snage#1337: thats really impressive, kinda inspiring too
 theChief#0001: yep - m.v.p is definitely right lol
 theChief#0001: 30 minute jams? I've done at least 20, if not more 🙂
 Snage#1337: how many times have you done this?? cuz like this is actually great as a m.v.p. atleast i think im using that term right
 Phallo#3476: also for other audio related things like this if you are using unity you can take a look at PlayScheduled and dspTime
 theChief#0001: it does occasionally freeze because webgl sucks, but I'm pretty pleased with it tbh 🙂
 M_Raven#4076: oooh, neat little bullet hell
 theChief#0001: BPM is beats per minute, 60/bpm is "how many seconds between beats" - use that with a timer (that uses the audio time, not game time - otherwise it'll desync over time!) 🙂
 Snage#1337: well "how small can a scope get" is surprisingly very simple to answer, didnt see that one coming
 M_Raven#4076: Actually pretty good, huh
 Henry_Hamster#4240: How would you do the music beat, like for continuous beats only or like do you like get the amplitude wave
 theChief#0001: scope small xD they tend to be something like this: http://domharris.uk/30min
 Snage#1337: mans made an aim trainer XDD
 Peter#0007: oh so like the soundtrack responds to the gameplay? that's awesome!
 Henry_Hamster#4240: reminds me of the autogenerated games video I saw from i think jonah or somethin I kinda forgot his name
 Phallo#3476: things like adding dynamic extra instruments to the music during crucial parts of gameplay
 theChief#0001: I do things like pause explosions til the beat, have particles that flash in time with the music, or give gameplay bonuses for doing actions in time with the music!
 M_Raven#4076: bro how??? I am genuinely impressed
 theChief#0001: well, I've made about 20 games in just 30 minutes - you can get pretty small 😂
 Peter#0007: sorry to ping, what do you mean by audio sync? i'm curious
 Henry_Hamster#4240: boring button but without all the redirects
 Snage#1337: makes me wonder how small a scope can get
 Snage#1337: was gonna say being humble might save a life but then realized how dumb that sounds
 Henry_Hamster#4240: I implemented like I think 10 weapons in my last game each with 5 upgrades and some with multiple different animations/scripts entirely D:
Not counting 3 simple ones
 M_Raven#4076: When you get your idea down I suggest making a list of all the mechanics, then narrow down what you want to implement
 Henry_Hamster#4240: Personally I'm not how much time to save for playtesting cause for 3 day minijams I always save a whole day for feedback implementation and playtesting
 K'miinik#3171: yeah, definitely gonna try and keep it really small
 RedTeapot#1960: I don't think impostor syndrome has any evolutionary benefit
 M_Raven#4076: ^^^
Know what you can and can't fit into your game within 48 hours
 theChief#0001: it's all about scope!
 K'miinik#3171: I'm definitely not gonna finish a game this jam, lol
 Snage#1337: makes me wonder if imposter syndrome was something humans developed to fight agaisnt the dunning kruger effect
 M_Raven#4076: Nah man I got this
 theChief#0001: no doubts whatsover 👍
 theChief#0001: what do you mean, I'm definitely winning this jam
 M_Raven#4076: A tip I learned that day: don't get overconfident, no matter how much you have done
 theChief#0001: oh damn, I do "I've got code for this somewhere it should be really easy" all the time 
 Snage#1337: where you "spend 10 candies to request a new feature from the developer" a couple times to get to the real game
 Snage#1337: reminds me of candybox2
 M_Raven#4076: I was able to repurpose code from another project so I thought my work was already halfway done when in reality it was more like 10%
 macleodian#7269: Ngl a main menu game could be fun
 M_Raven#4076: I didn't submit for that jam
 M_Raven#4076: There was a Christmas jam where I got too cocky and spent all my time making a really polished main menu, then I never finished the level itself
 macleodian#7269: I got top 5 in one jam 😎 ~~out of 13 but who's counting~~
 theChief#0001: if you do as many jams as I do, you tend to have at least a couple of winners 😂
 M_Raven#4076: I'm happy I got the top half of the leaderboard
 Redline#7370: above average I guess?
 theChief#0001: also I have come dead last plenty of times
 Henry_Hamster#4240: thats like my idea for the 110 mini jam, you sacrifice health for upgrades and if you run out of health you sacrifice your other stats for more health for more upgrades(its like a vampire surivvor style game kinda at least at its very core without the othe rmechanics)
 M_Raven#4076: I just checked again, placed #2032 out of last GMTK jam's submission count of 5719
 Snage#1337: 2000/???
 M_Raven#4076: Y'all talking about top 50 or top 100, meanwhile last jam I think I got top 2000 😭
 macleodian#7269: On the brightside it'll be a fun idea to play around with down the line, I still want to work on the idea I had for minijam 109 that basically involved sacrificing health for more damage and/or abilities
 theChief#0001: I rarely have enough time to make something I'd be pleased with
 theChief#0001: tbh I don't tend to join large jams very often
 theChief#0001: top 50 in brackeys is very nice, well done 😁
 M_Raven#4076: This is how everyone else reacted to me saying that lmao
 macleodian#7269: Speaking of audio what are some good resources for learning/practicing making music?
 Redline#7370: that's a considerably smaller jam than brackeys tho
 M_Raven#4076: Technically we have 23 people but over half of them are either just spectating or won't make up the majority of the work
 Henry_Hamster#4240: Fair enough, I often just choose my first idea too, and its hard to get away from that vision
 theChief#0001: bullet hell jam 2021 😂
 theChief#0001: I've used it in the past to get into the top 1
 Henry_Hamster#4240: Well its still a comically large team
 Redline#7370: audio sync is amazing and something I used to get that top 50
 macleodian#7269: I'll be sure to keep that in mind! I just had trouble getting away from Reigns for that jam for some reason
 M_Raven#4076: I don't think our comically large team has an audio person 😭
 theChief#0001: it was basically just an excuse for my friend to go crazy in a shader
 theChief#0001: there's a "calm" mode that turns it down 😉 but yeah it was pretty intense
 theChief#0001: depending on what the theme is, that'll look really different - but any audio sync stuff is better than no audio sync stuff
 BadPiggy#5202: Ooof
Too much even for me lol
 M_Raven#4076: I might go back to doing Minijams one day, but work schedule 😔
 Heimvana#7189: I'm flattered 😁
 macleodian#7269: I'm definitely gonna keep an eye out for something with plenty of time to work, I know SuNoFes is going on but idk if they want to do a visual novel for their first game
 Henry_Hamster#4240: Well I wold say if a idea is too complex try to get the very core of what makes it fun and restructure it, or just think of another idea
 StellarNightmare#2275: Oof so top 50 was still under 4 stars average
 Peshoddd#9446: One time i beated my friend with a pizza slice because he eated my peanuts.
 Phallo#3476: im really hoping for a high score in audio... i have dedicated audio person that i consider to be god level!
 Henry_Hamster#4240: Although maybe I should reword to a person who knows sound well
 macleodian#7269: I really wanted to try that one! But I was already busy with the My First Game Jam, and I couldn't figure out how to get my idea to work (basically a political sim that's a combination of Reigns and a TCG, where you play action cards to solve certain problems)
 Redline#7370: 3.861
 StellarNightmare#2275: What was the raw score???
 Henry_Hamster#4240: thats just called skill, although I'm talking about raw rating
 M_Raven#4076: that's also up there
 Redline#7370: me getting top 50 in audio completely by myself
 DrNukeLear#2414: “Food Fight” a beat-em which includes such weapons as: Chain of Sausages, baguettes, pizza slices and potatoes.
 BadPiggy#5202: If you were taking drugs, this is what you'd see
 Henry_Hamster#4240: audio is hard I think for most people without like a dedicated sound person
 macleodian#7269: I just did a game jam where that was the theme lol
Basically did a game similar to the lickitung minigame from Pokemon stadium
 M_Raven#4076: this game looks like something I'd see if I were to take drugs
 StellarNightmare#2275: I wonder how low the average score for audio was in brackeys jam because my game ranked 332 for a 3.267 average score...
 Henry_Hamster#4240: minijam 110 was amazing, the theme and limitation was good, the next one is colors i think
 macleodian#7269: Inb4 the scope is no more than racquetball with pong graphics 💀
But I am looking towards to trying a jam with some friends, I think we'll probably try the mini jam next week 
 BadPiggy#5202: Beat-em-up in a cafeteria
The ultimate food fight
 Redline#7370: hmm pizza forever
 DrNukeLear#2414: I’d laugh if the theme was just “food”
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: Is this where I slide in with the `\uparrow` notation?
 BadPiggy#5202: Lol. I remember this. It was a first person game for 7dfps
 theChief#0001: oooo if it was exponential it would take 0.3 seconds
 macleodian#7269: Wait wouldn't that one pizza game be basically that? (Istg it's a pizza that you endlessly run towards the center of but I can't remember the name)
 Henry_Hamster#4240: but for most physics systems there is terminal velocity, so theres that(unless no air drag)
 macleodian#7269: That's mainly what's been holding me back from working with someone else, I'm worried I don't know nearly enough yet and would just make the experience worse for someone else
 Redline#7370: using gravity, and jumping off the map and falling until you hit negative floating point limits
 Henry_Hamster#4240: Like I gave an example, ofc its niche, but what do you expect from such a question
 theChief#0001: if it was ^4 it would be just under 10 minutes
 GodOfPro#7302: that is just saying i just want to reach the limit why would do that in a normal game ?
 Henry_Hamster#4240: Look possible :DDD
 theChief#0001: if it was cubed every time, it would only be about 6 hours
 Henry_Hamster#4240: It can always be ^10
 Phallo#3476: it really depends on what you want from the jam... it can make it better because they help you and give you more time to do other things... or it can be worse because the people can be slow or unreliable and not actually help much at all actually wasting time because you have to communicate with them and then also do their part of the work
 Henry_Hamster#4240: well lets say the chance of a beneficial powerup gets square rooted every time the player gets past an obstacle, then it can break it lets say you store the value as 1/n
 theChief#0001: like, doable 😂 but not practical
 theChief#0001: that's still 4.3x10^9 actions - if it happened every frame at 120fps, that would be about 414 days of constant game time
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: So you're not going to reach the limits of your preferred data type, because the player normally stays around their starting origin
 macleodian#7269: Definitely plan on referencing them, though idk how much I'll be able to capitalize on them, still learning how to do basic stuff like animation 💀
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Because you're trying to reach the integer limit
 StellarNightmare#2275: I've never made a game with someone else. Is it better or more fun with someone else? Not that I have friends XD
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: Don't forget that most endless runners don't move the player, they move the world
 Henry_Hamster#4240: Someone's gonna find a way
 GodOfPro#7302: in a normal game why would a value get squared tho ?
 Henry_Hamster#4240: lets say a number gets squared every time you do an action
thats possible as long as the action is easy to do
 GodOfPro#7302: how you gonna reach 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 ?
 Henry_Hamster#4240: as long as just one of the values increases by a lets say exponential rate
 Henry_Hamster#4240: Are you sure about that? If it doesnt increase in difficulty faster than an optimal player can increase in strength/skill then its possible
 theChief#0001: they are _so_ useful
 theChief#0001: these ones should be right at the top!
 GodOfPro#7302: 18,446,744,073,709,551,615
 GodOfPro#7302: ik but it will be impossible to reach it by playing
 macleodian#7269: *immediately adds to 100+ video Game Making playlist*
 Henry_Hamster#4240: long still has an integer limit :DD even unsigned long long has :DDDDD
its why some 'simple' math questions require array multiplication
 StellarNightmare#2275: I think it would of helped if my game had anything but walking XD
 GodOfPro#7302: not when you use long
 theChief#0001: they should all be pretty straightforward to implement, too 🙂
 theChief#0001: oh also there are some good tips here about making your game more fun:
 Henry_Hamster#4240: How are you supposed to finish an endless runner?
Wait a minute, integer overflow, play until it freezes
 dardasaba#9759: Yes, no need to mention that part :D
 StellarNightmare#2275: If you didn't mention the second Lol part it would have been much more impressive Xd
 macleodian#7269: Broke: making a game everyone wants to finish
 Henry_Hamster#4240: we can just ignore the second part
 theChief#0001: yeah, it's a massive pain - but that's apple's fault 
 Henry_Hamster#4240: Thank you, I was just getting really annoyed at it spouting untrusted program at you 😄
 dardasaba#9759: I got #2 place on fun in my second jam!
 StellarNightmare#2275: My first one ranked low because of few ratings got a higher raw score though.
 Henry_Hamster#4240: we all wish...
 theChief#0001: don't zip it, use a tar archive! I'm pretty sure the itch client also does some funkiness to fix permissions, so if you're on a mac use that! Otherwise you'll pretty much have to run
`sudo chmod 755 /path/to/game.app/Contents/MacOS/game`
And
`sudo xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /path/to/game.app`
on every game 
 StellarNightmare#2275: My game I do think fit the theme of "it is not real" in that it was about a child having a nightmare. And then waking up.
 Henry_Hamster#4240: D: I made my last game jam game have customized enemies till 15 minutes, but its endless so I'm scared that everyone just failed in the first 5 to waves of maggots D: and I'll just get a 0 for enjoyment
 Redline#7370: I love how my first ever jam had a better overall score of #248 (brackeys 2021.2)
 dardasaba#9759: But I don't plan on starting any kind of OS war here, let's move a subject ;)
 dardasaba#9759: Same as Linux (some distros like arch maybe not, but distros like Ubuntu/mint? There's no such thing as more user friendly than them :D)
 StellarNightmare#2275: Nice my submission was called "My Shadow Man" it was boring to play but has a spooky atmosphere XD
 theChief#0001: yep! You also want to keep gameplay time low (5 minutes max from my experience) and you want to frontload all of your good content, because play time drops off after 2-3 minutes. So if you've spend half the jam making a really awesome boss fight that happens 10 minutes into the game, chances are nobody is going to see it 😭
 macleodian#7269: I find it funny my first two jam games were complete opposites of each other in difficulty. I don't think anyone finished the first one but the second had a quick and easy exploit 💀
 GodOfPro#7302: i use windows because of the games and apps it supports
 Snickerzilla#4948: windows is simple and user friendly that's all i really care about lol
 Redline#7370: brackeys 2022.1 like I said "latest" one
 Henry_Hamster#4240: How do you do mac builds without it screaming like 50 security warnings at you? D:
 StellarNightmare#2275: Which jam was it and what was it called?
 dardasaba#9759: But to each their own xD (is that the saying? I hope I didn't mess it up lol)
 Henry_Hamster#4240: And for me personally(and maybe also others) you have to be careful not to make your game too hard just cause you play it a lot, because the people rating it are probably only going to do one runthrough
 dardasaba#9759: I hate windows :D
 theChief#0001: windows is much more painful IMO 😉 but I use a mac, which is objectively the best OS 🙂
 Redline#7370: **my latest brackeys entry was:**
audio: #58
innovation: #207
graphics: #236
overall: #310
game design: #382
fun: #411 
theme: #842 
 StellarNightmare#2275: Linux is painful... I got windows
 dardasaba#9759: Thank you! I have decided to embrace my inner Godot <3
 Snickerzilla#4948: absolutely amazing pfp
 dardasaba#9759: ?
 theChief#0001: fun is a difficult one to do well in during a game jam, because it usually requires _either_ a bunch of playtesting _or_ a bunch of experience of what playtesters often tell you
 StellarNightmare#2275: Oh you poor thing...
 Henry_Hamster#4240: DDDDDDDDDDD: (insert kermit cry gif)
 theChief#0001: top 50ish percent in "fun" is pretty good for your second jam!
 StellarNightmare#2275: My latest Jam game submitted for Brackeys got scores ranked in order out of 1600+ submissions :332 for audio :350 for theme :354 for graphics :595 overall :793 for innovation :852 for fun :853 for game design. I really enjoyed the Jam but I think my game wasn't all that good. Especially not with the fun score Xd
 dardasaba#9759: (I use Linux :P)
 Henry_Hamster#4240: Or people who just feel bad and want to help someone get their first rating :(. But there's not much you can do about that
 theChief#0001: (this is why nigerian prince phishing emails are full of spelling mistakes)
 dardasaba#9759: And also some games (or on that matter, viruses) aren't a zip, they're just one executable...
For example Godot windows exports are one .exe and one .pck file, and you have the option to "embed .pck" making the game just one .exe file
 GodOfPro#7302: i will just stick to web builds
 Redline#7370: obviously duh
 theChief#0001: they _tend_ to be really low effort - it's rare to find viruses/hacks that seem to put in a lot of effort. They target people who don't do their due diligence, and want to filter out everyone with a bit of sense!
 Peshoddd#9446: i tell you that even .exe can be a virus it can be a convertet .bat file
 Henry_Hamster#4240: I'll upload a mac build just for you :D.(If you are using linux this is gonna be real awkward)
 Henry_Hamster#4240: yeah... its also much easier to play
 dardasaba#9759: Uh, not necessarily all people will "obviously" do that
Anyways I don't use windows so **I don't have such weaknesses**
 Henry_Hamster#4240: anything can have a virus basically(to the extent of my knowledge)
 Ilias L#2942: If you want to play it super safe, just stick exclusively to web builds.
 Henry_Hamster#4240: Probably just check if the files inside look legit, it shouldn't run unless you run it directly or unzip it right?
 Redline#7370: yeah but you'd obviously check for anything sus first
 GodOfPro#7302: .zip can have a virus
 dardasaba#9759: Yes but if you downloaded the zip you're probably gonna run the executable as well :P
 Redline#7370: the great thing is that a .zip folder can't be dangerous unless you start opening files
 Henry_Hamster#4240: I normally try to avoid any which look like spam/empty submissions, but yeah you never know if they stole a cover image from somewhere
 Peshoddd#9446: i can help with music
 dardasaba#9759: I've actually started coding my upcoming (non jam) game to get used to game dev again after the long break I took :D
It's going good, already got some of the essentials working
 redve#6507: It's 1gb afaik, it's not that bad
 GodOfPro#7302: someone asked him
 theChief#0001: be wary of windows download-only games that have no screenshots, no description and a low-effort cover image! I'll be checking games like this and flagging them for removal, but there are going to be a TON of entries
 Henry_Hamster#4240: They can always bloat it if they try hard enough :DDD
 GodOfPro#7302: still the same
 Henry_Hamster#4240: Wait I'm not alone, join me brother/sister
 Redline#7370: I think you'd notice the really smol filesize of the "game"
 redve#6507: Wait, i just realized its not "join the cult"
 Henry_Hamster#4240: If someone uploads a virus as their project submission I will go into the corner and cry for like a day
 Peshoddd#9446: anyways
 Redline#7370: the thing that I want to know is why he'd say that here
 Peshoddd#9446: copy&paste +  edit
 StellarNightmare#2275: I would argue my first jam game from brackeys 2021 .2 was better than the next one. Simply because it had game play and replayablity.
 Henry_Hamster#4240: I read it as "The first is simply to join o cult"... I am very good at engrish
 GodOfPro#7302: that isn't making viruses you are just copy pasting it smh
 Redline#7370: hmmmmmmmm
 redve#6507: I was looking for a way to port sdl2 game to js, and i found an interesting quote
```
The first is simply to join the occult, JavaScript has its redeeming features 
```
 StellarNightmare#2275: Lol
 theChief#0001: also hi yes I'd like to report a murder
 Ilias L#2942: Remember If you make a bad game this time. You'll make a better one next time.
 Henry_Hamster#4240: Make some good vibes :D.
 StellarNightmare#2275: I've started making my own music recently so would be interesting to have my own in the game.
 Redline#7370: try to come up with something simple but fun for gameplay and you'll probably be fine
 theChief#0001: you can! 🙂 it's totally doable, for everyone. It's just about expectations.
If I were you, I'd open up your engine of choice and make a little game in 3-4 hours before the jam starts - just to see how it goes
 StellarNightmare#2275: I see you're practicing, do as I say not do as I do.
 Phallo#3476: thats how i estimated how long something would take for my job... think of how long it would take and then double it and then add 10% extra time... this rule made my estimates actually pretty accurate
 Henry_Hamster#4240: I just get the opposite... I work too hard on gameplay but suck at polish+art+music
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: Ah thanks
 Peshoddd#9446: PRO TIP: Don't be noob!
 Henry_Hamster#4240: Good luck with your game!
 StellarNightmare#2275: I am somewhat concerned that I won't be able to make a good game in the time. As my previous game "Brakeys 2022.1" I made a game that got good ratings for visuals and audio but just fell flat when it came to game play.
 Peshoddd#9446: You wanna hear a pro tip
 yugioh#7402: Good luck
 theChief#0001: yeah, I really hate objective-c - it's such a shame you _have_ to use it for some things 
 Ilias L#2942: Good luck!
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: It's my first game jam, I'm using an engine which I've only made one small game with using a tutorial, I'm doing it on my own, and in a place with a garbage internet connection :)
Wish me luck
 SlamBamActionman#7160: (Swift mainly, but you know how it is)
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Yes
 Henry_Hamster#4240: I should probably try that myself... I always overscope D:(or not overscope just spend too much time in the end)
 Ilias L#2942: I recently started using Toggl to clock my jam hours in for fun.
 Henry_Hamster#4240: He's too dangerous to be kept alive
 theChief#0001: e.g. I'll be doing two 8-10 hour days, so I'm making a game I think I should be able to finish in around 4-6 hours
 theChief#0001: sleep, eat well, drink lots, and make a game you think you can do in about 20-30% of __your available time__ 🙂
 Peshoddd#9446: The easiest way of making a computer virus is making a .bat one in notepad or notepad++ which is better or some other program
1. Copy a popular virus
2. Paste it
3. Edit it so it becomes more dangerous
4. Convert it from .bat to .exe
5. Publish it.
6. Done. You affected some computers
 Ilias L#2942: take alot of breaks, sleeping and eating well save more time than it costs most of the time.
No matter your scope, be ready to cut features down ALOT.
 theChief#0001: swift or objective-c? 😂
 Henry_Hamster#4240: pretty basic things, but still just as important
 RedTeapot#1960: At least you're dying with a fancy anodised aluminium case
 Henry_Hamster#4240: Plan your time well and know what you can get done in the time frame, also dont overwork yourself to the point where you cantfocus
 StellarNightmare#2275: I've never done a game jam in 48 hours plus I'm probably going to have to do this on my own. Is there anything I should be aware of before hand?
 Merus#7019: I believe in you senpai
 SlamBamActionman#7160: I'm dying
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Please
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Help me
 SlamBamActionman#7160: I am coding an iOS app right now
 Henry_Hamster#4240: wait teach me... wattttt(/jk please dont sue me noooooooo D:)
 StellarNightmare#2275: ...
 Henry_Hamster#4240: Fair enough, but there is a 13 year age limit
 theChief#0001: but a lot of the more active ones are adults yeah
 RedTeapot#1960: Me. Sometimes a website, sometimes a Discord bot, sometimes a compiler, sometimes a tool
 Phallo#3476: ive been making websites for some big companies for a larger part of a decade now
 Peshoddd#9446: well i don't code games too just some computer viruses
 theChief#0001: I think most people in the server are younger than you think 😉
 Henry_Hamster#4240: I used to but I stopped since tbh game dev is so much more fun, but also I'm still really young compared to most people here so yeah(at least I assume)
 -CRYPT1X-#9677: I'm building my own website if that counts
 theChief#0001: I make apps in Unity for my day job 😛
 theChief#0001: yeah that's what ultrawidegamer said here 🙂
 tykenn#8548: Is that just submissions/joined? Would it be higher than 30% counting all the teams who had multiple people join?
 Peshoddd#9446: Who codes something other than games?
 StellarNightmare#2275: Hello There...
 Peshoddd#9446: Well we'll get the theme after 32 hours
 Ilias L#2942: thats pretty good for a bigger jam
 theChief#0001: 30% is 🤯
 theChief#0001: generally I consider 20% to be pretty damn good
 Vatredox#8968: not surprised brackeys had low submission rate lol
 theChief#0001: yeah that's fair - it's just a _very_ good number
 Phallo#3476: its prolly actually higher than that because i bet a bunch of people like artists click the join button on the page as well
 Peshoddd#9446: Yes we can, like i joined a 5k ppl jam and the sumbissions were 150
 theChief#0001: brackeys is 10% lol
 theChief#0001: that's excellent
 theChief#0001: actually can we talk about the fact that GMTK jam has am almost 30% submission rate
 Peshoddd#9446: So you don't remember that if you send this message you will make a mass W spam not 3 but 4 times?
 tykenn#8548: Unless thousands of us all leave/un-join.
 theChief#0001: no it isn't - 17,000 people have already joined - which is 7,000 more than brackeys! It's guaranteed that GMTK will be all three spots 🙂
 Henry_Hamster#4240: using populations at different timezones? That's kinda nice(if only it didnt start at midnight for me)
 Ilias L#2942: Itsa me prinni from the GDTV jam btw.
 theChief#0001: I'm everywhere 😉
 Ilias L#2942: Oh wow your a mod here too Chief 👀
 theChief#0001: my jam is top too! Top of page two 
 Phallo#3476: i actually took a look at what time would be the best to start the game jam worldwide so the least amount of people would get screwed over due to things like work and the time that it starts at is basically the best time
 Peshoddd#9446: Well it is too soon for W
 Henry_Hamster#4240: rip Brackeys D:
 darlingS#1797: I'm actively waking up at 1 am to see the theme when its announced
 Peshoddd#9446: Yeah
 Merus#7019: looking forward to being unconscious when the theme's announced!
 Peshoddd#9446: 17.5k for now and 21.9k for 22
 theChief#0001: I'd bet you get a jump when the theme video goes live too
 theChief#0001: though, that's assuming you get a massive spike in the hours leading up to jam start
 Merus#7019: 3k more signups in 2021 but only 400 new submissions
 theChief#0001: i'd be surprised if we didn't beat 2020 tbh
 Mark Brown#6982: i think we'll beat 2020, probably not 2021
 theChief#0001: 🥷
 Merus#7019: 2020 was 18.3k, 2021 was 21.9k
 theChief#0001: no, it was 22k people last year and 18k the year before 😂
 Merus#7019: 17.5k so far
 Peshoddd#2982: Imma check if we beated GMTK 21 by signups
 Jaymaican#9295: 😮 ! That would be awesome if you could.
 Merus#7019: doesn't look like we've beaten the 2020 signups yet
 Mark Brown#6982: But I can reach out!
 Jaymaican#9295: 😦 all good,
thanks! 🙂
 Mark Brown#6982: Haven't heard from YoYo this year, sorry
 Henry_Hamster#4240: but if you convert it into an equation f(x) as x->infinity approaches infinity :DDD.
 Peshoddd#9446: I'm not so sure about that, but i think we can beat 1 million after years because 1 of 50 people codes.
 Jaymaican#9295: Yo is HTML5 export for Game Maker Studio 2 gonna be free this year like it was for last year's jam?
 Henry_Hamster#4240: at this rate, one day we will exceed the world population
 Peshoddd#9446: I think yes
 Peshoddd#9446: Yeah
 Merus#7019: oh, have we beaten 2021 signups yet?
 Peshoddd#9446: Well good luck to Mark for beating again his and itch's record
 Merus#7019: it's after Mark does his Best Games from the 2022 Game Jam video, which is after voting closes
 Merus#7019: that takes a week or two, and then there's the week before
 Phallo#3476: actually that is a good question... how long do the channels usually stay open after the jam
 Merus#7019: we close it after voting and after Mark picks his favourite games
 Peshoddd#9446: Yo the jam lasts 2 days
 Merus#7019: maintaining a public discord that does not make Mark sad requires more effort than can be reasonably be spared, but we can do it for a few weeks during the jam
 Phallo#3476: real weather here though... 17c and cloudy
 Peshoddd#9446: Ok, thanks
 Peshoddd#9446: Sunny here 26C
 Phallo#3476: ya... so basically anyone can join... but only the patrons can see the permanent channels
 dardasaba#9759: It's nice, 30°C
 Peshoddd#9446: ok now i get it
 dardasaba#9759: During jam times, the discord opens to the public, but when it ends, all the channels we (the non patrons) can see/write messages in close
Technically we're not kicked out and can remain here until next year, but 🤷‍♂️
 pogrammerX#1167: it just turned out that sare uses 29 gigs of memory when drawing one cube....
i guess ill just DirectX
 Phallo#3476: Dark, currently 4:18am
 Peshoddd#9446: How's the weather?
 Phallo#3476: i am not, everyone with a white name is not a patron
 dardasaba#9759: No he's not
 Peshoddd#9446: so you say that you are a patron
 Phallo#3476: not during game jam time... yes
 Peshoddd#9446: wait do you need to be patreon to enter here?
 Sapient#3138: Sed
 dardasaba#9759: No I don't think so
 Sapient#3138: If someone not from patreon wins the jam , then would they have perm access to the server?
Oh hey a new HeartBeast series is out! 
 Peshoddd#9446: Well just GMT physics
 dardasaba#9759: Ayy same! 10:13 for me too
 Peshoddd#9446: oh 1 hours before me
 Redline#7370: and it's like 9:13 here
 Redline#7370: I have been up for like 1.5 hours by now
 dardasaba#9759: Just woke up xD
 dardasaba#9759: Good morning!
 ADEEL#5105: Its yhe timer that makes people fall asleep for 10secs
 ADEEL#5105: No
 Peshoddd#9446: everyone sleepin' i think
 pogrammerX#1167: but ey, as long as it works, that whats matters!
 RedTeapot#1960: That's weird
 pogrammerX#1167: but it works
 pogrammerX#1167: and i dont know why
 pogrammerX#1167: and it has more fps than directx
 pogrammerX#1167: it has c and  c++ wrapped around it
 pogrammerX#1167: its something else
 RedTeapot#1960: I have. I think it implies that SARE is something else than DirectX. Or is it a layer on top of that?
 pogrammerX#1167: read the text in perentacies
 RedTeapot#1960: So what are you using to draw the stuff? OpenGL? Vulkan? You need something to interface with the GPU (unless you blit the pixels manually)
 pogrammerX#1167: if you mean dis its there
 pogrammerX#1167: its noz
 BadPiggy#5202: Was asking if you're engine was written in Monogame but I guess not
 pogrammerX#1167: ?
 BadPiggy#5202: Monogame ?
 pogrammerX#1167: i do, i got alot of meshes, i think i get so many fps, cos the vertecies the camera doesnt see wont get calculated
so if there is a cube and look at it from the front only 4 vertecies will get rendered instead of 8
 RedTeapot#1960: Also, doesn't .NET allow bundling all the stuff with the game? Java somewhat does
 CrazyTurtle2000#3954: i will look into that! sounds useful
 Bronsolo#4491: If I don't find a team I'll make some boss fight music. Lol!
 Phallo#3476: personally i use github projects for keeping track of my stuff and have the categories of Extras, To Do, In Progress, Done (also this year i will prolly add a blocked column because im working with a team)
 Snage#1337: gl to you too! and remember have fun and learn!
 RedTeapot#1960: Try adding some actual stuff to your game and the FPS will go down
 CrazyTurtle2000#3954: well good luck to everyone taking part this year, I'm looking forward to seeing what everyone creates 😄
 pogrammerX#1167: okay, then ill just use unity
i asked cos i have my own game engine, made using .NET, and i get around 8000 fps
 CrazyTurtle2000#3954: good strat, i think i will do that 🙂
 BadPiggy#5202: Tbh, if it's an older version then most people will probably have it like Teapot said.
But if it's a version that some people may not have like 5.0, then it might be a problem.
Cus I doubt people would install it just for a jam game
 pogrammerX#1167: fck
 SeanSS#0892: 2 days is not a lot of time so you should be weary of keeping your game scope in check
 Phallo#3476: i will suggest making list of things to do and only work on the 100% needed items for the game first... everything else is a nice to have
 RedTeapot#1960: I think it might be, if you need to go to a website and download it. It might be already installed for some people but IMO it doesn't count
 CrazyTurtle2000#3954: im a bit of a perfectionist so i struggle with cutting things out that aren't completely essential. but i will try to limit myself more for this
 pogrammerX#1167: i just read the rules, so no additional downloads allowed, is the .NET download in that category too?
 Phallo#3476: the other ones i have not finished came down to either not enough experience or too bold of and idea for the timeframe... so make sure to practice and choose a very small idea for the jam!
 CrazyTurtle2000#3954: true
 Snage#1337: i mean look at it the other way, its not uncommon for that to happen, so its not that big of a deal.
 CrazyTurtle2000#3954: damn thats not very reassuring haha
 Bronsolo#4491: I am. Never done this before. Been eyeballin' it for a while, though
 slightlybonkers#4912: i have participated in previous GMTK jams though
 Phallo#3476: very mixed, i have only ever finished 2 of my game jam games
 slightlybonkers#4912: ayyy same here (6th game jam)
 CrazyTurtle2000#3954: wow 6, how did ur previous jams go?
 Snage#1337: its ok if that happens, sure its a little disappointing, but you still learn things and its not like this is your ONLY chance, there are other jams and there will be next year.
 CrazyTurtle2000#3954: its such a short window and im pretty new to game dev altogether
 Phallo#3476: this will be my 6th game jam... but my first one with a proper team and also my first GMTK one
 CrazyTurtle2000#3954: im a little worried imma be the same for this one
 Fraserfatt#1021: just 1
 Snage#1337: i tried last jam but failed to get a complete project done
 CrazyTurtle2000#3954: how many have you all taken part in?
 RedTeapot#1960: Stayed up until like 5 AM once... Since I've done no all-nighters, it felt really off seeing the sunrise, kinda like something was wrong kek
 Snage#1337: me! kinda
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: NOPE!!
 CrazyTurtle2000#3954: anyone else new to this?
 Phallo#3476: at this point i am basically nocturnal
 Phallo#3476: ive been awake for only 3 hours... it is currently 3:30am
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: If I can do it anyway...
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: After midnight here... Bed is still covered and not made... Probably gonna sleep on the couch...
 Tapu#9161: I try to get to bed before 12 no matter what
 Snage#1337: nice
 CrazyTurtle2000#3954: Hey ppl, just joined this will be my first game jam
 JanbluTheDerg#1018: Very true
 SeanSS#0892: Thx
 RedTeapot#1960: Yep
 SeanSS#0892: Quick question are you allowed to decorate the itch page after you submitted it?
 BadPiggy#5202: Games with the smallest scope usually have the most tightest design, so nothing wrong with that lol
 Snickerzilla#4948: I've actually been more focused on my work when tired, probably because that's the only thing going through my mind at the moment, doesn't mean you'd do better though
 RedTeapot#1960: Yeah, and if you are well-slept you may do a task in a fraction of the time it would take otherwise. With fewer bugs too
 DavidL1450#5480: This is a trap that a lot of software developers fall into ; the keep working on something when they should be sleeping, then their code is all buggy because they couldn't pay attention while coding.
 tykenn#8548: Add a dream journal to the mix, and sleep could double as a brainstorming session
So sleep _is_ important as it makes you more productive
 Mark Brown#6982: You absolutely *should* sleep during the game jam - not only is sleep good for your physical and mental health, any work you do while exhausted will be garbage. Give yourself proper breaks!
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: I though it was for the week...
 JanbluTheDerg#1018: I'm annoyed because I'm on holiday during jam time, so I'll have to aim really small if at all
 RedTeapot#1960: Sleep is important
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Well, I just got my insane and rather minimalistic schedule done for GMTK...
*Reads last item*
Sleep? What's that?
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: 😏
 M_Raven#4076: Damn they're no longer typing 😔
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Or am I??
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: That explains why, when I stare into the void, I saw myself with a wickedly devilish smile with blood stained face, tattered clothes, eyes glowing red, with the sound of hundreds of innocent people screaming bloody murder in the background and haunting voices that would not stop!!!
...
...
But hey, it was worth staring into that for a hour and a half for those really delicious cookies
 Bronsolo#4491: In the Philippines they got Cheese ice cream. I'm not a fan
 M_Raven#4076: **Superchocolatemilkshake** is typing...
 yugioh#7402: Humans gazed into the abyss and they only saw their reflection
 yugioh#7402: The eldritch horrors were humans all along
 birdstone#3073: **we're human**
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Tuna flavored Ice cream
 yugioh#7402: I'm worried
 M_Raven#4076: **what**
 yugioh#7402: Ohhhh gotcha
 birdstone#3073: i've seen someone make both beef ice cream and salmon ice cream
 Phallo#3476: grapenut is basically a type of grain cereal and grapenut ice cream is vanilla ice cream with that grapenut cereal in it
 yugioh#7402: Tuna flavored would be worse imo
 M_Raven#4076: Imagine a beef-flavored ice cream
 yugioh#7402: I had to search what that is
 theChief#0001: Savory ice cream exists. It's an abomination, but it does exist
 theChief#0001: If it's a flavour, there's probably an ice cream of it 😂
 Phallo#3476: im always the weird one and it is a flavor that most people dont even know about... but grapenut ice cream
 yugioh#7402: Lemon ice cream is also good
 yugioh#7402: Mango is soooo good i love mango juice
 Snage#1337: ooooo never heard of lime ice cream, might try that
 Henry_Hamster#4240: lime or mango :DDD
 yugioh#7402: Oh that's a good choice
 Snage#1337: mint choco chip
 yugioh#7402: So what's everyone favorite ice cream flavor mine is oreo and strawberry
 Snage#1337: nice
 yugioh#7402: A biscuit with vanilla
 Snage#1337: what flavor?
 yugioh#7402: I just eaten a delicious ice cream
 BadPiggy#5202: I can't remember the last time Updated Unity tbh lol
 BadPiggy#5202: Yeesh
For everyone looking at that merger between Unity and that company, it won't matter for a long time
It's not like you'll get an update tomorrow for something with malware in it
And plus if you're using older or LTS versions, I doubt it would matter either
 Scolon#4218: no engine just use graphics and physics libraries xddd
 Bas#8941: I will manually punch in every card hole
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: I know that Godot and Game Maker is 2D but still, and Unreal is not bad either... Google search can be your friend here too
 Phallo#3476: lulululul
 M_Raven#4076: Simply make your game using punch cards and sheer will
 Fraserfatt#1021: powerful, menacing energy lmao
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Well, there is Godot, Game Maker, or you can be crazy like me and make your own...
 Lawn#1538: I’m sure the skills are easily transferable from Unity to Godot.
 wren#0640: my first jam i learned it very roughly in less than a week so?
 Tapu#9161: Is learning Godot in a day a bad idea?
 Scolon#4218: Just use the engine you're most familiar with for the jam, why switch now?
 Fraserfatt#1021: it is impossible. but not as terrible as youd think
 Bas#8941: It's more that I would like to switch right now, but learning UE in a day seems impossible
 Scolon#4218: Reading the unity blog, UnityEngine should still be fine as an engine
But I can see why you would not want to give them any sort of money now
 wren#0640: godots great but it doesnt really have the ability to port to like any major consoles yet
 wren#0640: it sucks that theres no real good option for commercial indie game dev now unless you wanna go with unreal which isnt really suited to small teams
 M_Raven#4076: My entire team's already locked into using Unity 😔, I might relearn Godot after this jam though
 Snage#1337: tru
 Fraserfatt#1021: you'll be fine for the jam... into The Future™️ however...
 Lawn#1538: It’s not the first questionable move they’ve made.
 Snage#1337: damn welp time to never update it again
 Bas#8941: Very cool of you Unity to merge with the malware company
Welp. Dunno what engine to use now.
 Lawn#1538: Is that you in the background ?
 M_Raven#4076: The young devs and the old devs will merge to create middle-age devs
 yugioh#7402: Non devs rise up
 Phallo#3476: i feel this immensely
 Ajh#5371: I’m not a dev either, just curious about game jam
 yugioh#7402: Lmao
 Snage#1337: lol
 Lawn#1538: Old devs unite
 yugioh#7402: Nah it's fine dw about it
 Snage#1337: oh sry to assume
 yugioh#7402: Sorry but I'm not a dev i just like gmtk
 Ajh#5371: ^^ me too!
 Snage#1337: young devs les gooo!
 yugioh#7402: That's cool enjoy your holiday
 M_Raven#4076: I'm also still in high school but right now is summer break for me
 yugioh#7402: Cool ig
 Snage#1337: same but i jsut dont start last yr of school til the 21rst
 yugioh#7402: I'm still in high school but i took the year off
 Snage#1337: rough
 M_Raven#4076: I go to work on Friday 😭
 500SQM#5334: im on holiday during this 😦
 Snickerzilla#4948: I'm proud of what came out of it and I can use it on other projects in the future :]
 yugioh#7402: I see it's 8am here and i woke up in 10 pm
 Snickerzilla#4948: I totally get that, I've actually done that before, it got me semi finished songs to provide as examples to others :)
 M_Raven#4076: I'm doing well, it's 1AM over here though
 yugioh#7402: I'm great thx for asking wbu
 Snage#1337: Same at first
 M_Raven#4076: How is everyone doing?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: that as a goal is a great thing, it doesn't make it a waste of time if you don't manage the goal. You could work on your own and not manage it either. Working on a game solo vs in a team is a different skill set, it depends what skillset you want to work on
 BricksParts#5032: I got confused cause I thought the search bar was a way to create a post
 BricksParts#5032: Oh I see
 BricksParts#5032: Is there a way to search ads based on tags?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: have a look on the team finder, there's a tab for "other"
 Snickerzilla#4948: I would just like there to be a finished project and for there to be a little bit of recognition out of it :'p
 BricksParts#5032: This is a kinda weird question, but I wonder if any mentionable portion of the teams taking part in the jam include someone who has skills in the business and/or marketing side of things- most likely in addition to some development skills (whether that's art, coding, etc. etc.)?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Why would learning a bunch of stuff and being able to evaluate your time management and efficiency and practicing a skill set you are trying to grow be a waste of time?
 Snickerzilla#4948: tySm lolll
 yugioh#7402: Oh yeah by the way i like your name snickerzilla
 Snickerzilla#4948: I so wish composer and sound designer were separate tags 😭
 yugioh#7402: Cool
 Snickerzilla#4948: Awesome!
 Snage#1337: Well u guys have convinced me, I’m gonna post on team finder
 Snickerzilla#4948: Most people don't provide previous projects
 Snickerzilla#4948: I'm still trying to find the right time, just weary of what the project will end up being like DD:
 Snage#1337: That’s really nice of you to say, thank you so much.
 Snickerzilla#4948: Aw maaan
 Henry_Hamster#4240: yeah... I found a sound guy yesterday 😦
 Snickerzilla#4948: ~~You have a composer Henry? lOl~~
 Henry_Hamster#4240: I would personally invite you but my team is mostly filled D:
 Snage#1337: Didn’t know those existed 👀
 Snickerzilla#4948: Something like that :O
 Snickerzilla#4948: Oh yeah fr, teams who just wanna learn
 Henry_Hamster#4240: Or you can always contact teams with more newer people and try your first game jam together
 Snickerzilla#4948: I think maybe just stating that you're new and not a long time developer or something among those lines in the description of your post before you write anything else would be a good idea :)
 Henry_Hamster#4240: Don't worry I didn't even participate last year cause I wasn't confident enough D:
I regret it now, but at least I feel like I'm a lot more confident now
 Snage#1337: Thank god I thought I was just being shy for a good couple of hours
 DoctorCampbell#0545: My best recommendation for worrying about not submitting is to get the primary game loop up then submitting the project so incase all else fails at least you have that up
 Snickerzilla#4948: I get how you feel man
 Henry_Hamster#4240: if you want to be in a team, find a team who is willing to let you in and all is good, if you want to work solo, then don't
Don't be afraid to try
 Snage#1337: I feel like i would just get in the way
 Snage#1337: Should I still use team finder even if I’m still very new to game development?
 Henry_Hamster#4240: yeah thats normal
the minijams I participate allow you to submit late for that reason
idk about gmtk though
 Snickerzilla#4948: Some projects in game jams just don't end up getting finished right? I'm worried about joining a team and wasting my time when the project doesn't even get submitted :/
 tykenn#8548: A daily meeting at 10 AM. And then we break off, schedule additional meetings with certain people when needed, and just make sure we're completing our tasks.
 BadPiggy#5202: Damn. What time do you guys actually start work then lol ?
 BadPiggy#5202: (sniffs)
||***She was a true patriot***||
 Henry_Hamster#4240: You have found your people
 tykenn#8548: At my last job, I checked in some code at 3AM (I wasn't overworking, just sleeping at weird times), and the next morning one of my coworkers was concerned. Now at my current job when I do it I see that half my co-workers are apparently on a similar schedule despite us all living in the same time zone
 Phallo#3476: its 130am here and i just woke up after 6 hours of sleep
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: ***It's never too late for America.***
 tykenn#8548: I don't know how I managed before WFH
 tykenn#8548: "too late for america" Yeah, my sleep schedule is all kinds of messed up
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: its too late for america too early for europe its not surprising its quiet
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Oui.
 Scolon#4218: sup
 9bitmax#3119: hi
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: There are pros and cons to small teams, big teams, and solo work for any length of jam, and those change etc based on the jam specifics
 Merus#7019: but over two days, super hard
 Merus#7019: yeah, I'd imagine if you had a month or two you'd be able to get everyone stormed, normed and performing
 Scolon#4218: Methinks that's probably because of how short the jam is
 Scolon#4218: It's pretty much even
 Scolon#4218: Yeah looking at past jams, there's never been any results where teams had any sort of noticeable lead over solos
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: that will definitely not be an issue. People were looking at the breakdown of top games made by groups vs solos and stuff and it was pretty even
 Scolon#4218: Well being in a big team doesn't automatically mean said team is going to make a good game.
 Tapu#9161: I bet first place overall would be a solo or a team of three
 Lawn#1538: Me too, I’m kinda thinking it’ll be a too many chefs effect
 Merus#7019: I'm actually hoping some of the really big teams don't do so hot so that solos and duos get an opportunity to shine
 Lawn#1538: That’s just so freakin’ sweet. I’m keen to see what they can all do with these labour forces.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: But there's mulitple 9s and other large groups of TF
 Lawn#1538: That’s a rugby squad
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: pretty sure Shadow isn't going bigger than 11
 Fraserfatt#1021: that's a dang studio at that point 😂
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yeah there is
 Lawn#1538: There’s a 24 person team iirc
 Lawn#1538: The Shadow clan is expanding I see
 Brittus Bonkus#6041: Large teams often have a problem with workloads, more people mean people think they have to do less, and as a result of everyone thinking on that, less it done
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: the biggest team I know of so far had 24 last I heard
 Fraserfatt#1021: I'd only recommend larger teams if you really know them and/or have a producer ready to delegate
 Merus#7019: there is a larger team out there
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: that is not true
 Merus#7019: nope
 MagicSteve#6162: the biggest team so far has 15 members, on the teamfinder
 Merus#7019: yeah, I'd imagine a larger team is going to need to spend a lot more time getting on the same page and a lot less time making things
 Fraserfatt#1021: I'd recommend the smaller team if I had to pick between two
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: if you want a better chance of getting something done probably a smaller team unless you are very confident that the lead o the large group has experience of large groups and everyone on board is completely committed
 MagicSteve#6162: Having 2 members can have quicker communications between each other, but having many members with different roles means more work done in less time.  Any thoughts?
 Selviam#7268: imagine if there was a team but none of them worked on the same game but a series of small games like each person made a continuation of the last game
 Fraserfatt#1021: ...what *is* the biggest team? 😂
 Fraserfatt#1021: I stream once in a while so I def have everything ready to go
 MagicSteve#6162: Do I join a 2 member team or a 14 member team for GMTK?
 Lyfe#8258: I mean if you already have your software setup then sure but I don't think it's worth it to try figure that out at the same time as doing the jam
 Lyfe#8258: Oh god what about having the most horrible continuity between shots, like your tshirt changes between different camera angles
 Fraserfatt#1021: debating on whether or not I should stream my process when the jam starts ~~and embarrass myself in front of people with my typing mistakes~~
 Tree#7119: Hire someone to do parkour.
 _Nate#3737: FMV platformer
 Lyfe#8258: Or a fixed camera horror game but fmv
 tykenn#8548: Even better, live action video with digital inserts like in rabbids 2
 _Nate#3737: Nah Harvester did FMV point and click right
 Lyfe#8258: Hahaha what about one of those point and click adventure games from back then but it's FMV, so you need to film a walking "animation" for basically every pair of points you can interact with
 Jaymaican#9295: Yo does anyone know if Game Maker Studio 2 is doing the free export for HTML5 for the jam?
 _Nate#3737: someone gotta make an FMV game for the jam that'd be so sick
 Lyfe#8258: Unless you film it on the equipment they used to film it back in the 90s and compare that to PC graphics today
 Lyfe#8258: Can't beat them in terms of graphics
 VulpineMachine#2173: FMV gaming is possibly peak gaming. We're long past the glory days, boys, might as well pack it in.
 BadPiggy#5202: I'd love to do voice acting for my games tbh
But I'd just sound like a pig
 Lyfe#8258: Most importantly they need to be unnecessarily camp
 tykenn#8548: A series of unenthusiastic voiced onomatopoeias, and then once the expectation is set, end the game with a single scream at the top of your lungs
 Lyfe#8258: The one I thought of was a western revolver duel
 Lyfe#8258: You can't just write a film with some branching paths FMV games have to have some terrible gameplay gimmick
 Lyfe#8258: You have 2 days to make an FMV game
 VulpineMachine#2173: forget the theme...FLY FREE
 VulpineMachine#2173: DO IT
 Lyfe#8258: Oh I just had a sick idea for a whole game jam now
 Lyfe#8258: Same with the damage sound and "ow"
 VulpineMachine#2173: i'd play that
 Lyfe#8258: If I do make a shooter I plan on making the bullet sound just be me saying the word "bang" as unenthusiastically as I can muster
 Henry_Hamster#4240: Well for any non-natural sounds thats probably one of the easiest ways to generate one with variety
 Lyfe#8258: I watched a video on sound effects in games and it said that the first port of call should be the human mouth, particularly for any especially gross sounds
 birdstone#3073: oh my god this website
 VulpineMachine#2173: Got a quality mic on a boom and was gonna record him making the sound effects for different things like "hey kid do the sound for running water" and whatever sound he does...well that's the sound it is!
 Lawn#1538: How are you going to do the sound effects?
 Lawn#1538: Kid art always reminds me of this site

 VulpineMachine#2173: I was thinking about hooking up the scanner actually XD
 VulpineMachine#2173: Where's the lie
 Lyfe#8258: It'll be hell when it turns out they did it on paper and you don't have a scanner
 Lawn#1538: Kid art would make great cursed enemies.
 VulpineMachine#2173: Yeah it should be cute importing assets made by a bunch of kids XD
 Lawn#1538: Kid art backgrounds and sprites.
 Lawn#1538: Sounds like you’ve got your style worked out.
 VulpineMachine#2173: My oldest wants to make "art" for the game, and my younger one wants to do the sound effects for the game. Seeing as they're young still, they're gonna end up making gobbledygook...I mean, it'll be BEAUTFUL gobbledygook since it's my kids, but I'm just saying. XD
 Lyfe#8258: Too annoying to explain in text, but basically pfp and text overlap sometimes and it was annoying
 Lyfe#8258: Nah it was a discord bug
 Lawn#1538: Get them coding young so they can pay for your retirement.
 RiverDog#8199: heres my Game plan *pun intended:  I can make a sprite, and a tilemap, and i can make the sprite move.  I cannot yet make the enemy sprite move, tilemap boundaries do not quite work probably because i think my motion moving the position over the boundaries, but the collision works.. and as much as i'd like the sprite to shoot, i think that way out of scope.  in fact everything is out of scope aside from, make a spirte, make the sprite move, on a map, and make the collision with something depending on the theme cause the game over
 null_ham#2050: child labor 😎
 VulpineMachine#2173: Speaking of my kids, they looked at the Game Jam trailer and they've decided they want to help me make a game as a team! 😄
 VulpineMachine#2173: That means way more than you know. Everyday I question myself. Thanks. A lot.
 Lawn#1538: Is it related to GMTK or the game jam at all?
 Hobusu#5033: ...Report bugs for what?
 Lyfe#8258: So idk where you report bugs anymore
 Lyfe#8258: They had a really bad server where you would report bugs, but that server stopped existing
 Lyfe#8258: Hi
 BetterThanYou#4809: otheres ill post my own
 Lyfe#8258: Cuz the discord testers server is completely dead
 Henry_Hamster#4240: Just keep trying, make sure to use the filters, although to be honest, its a little more difficult as a coder in my opinion, but its far from impossible
 Lyfe#8258: Yo does anyone know where discords bug reporter is
 JR Coder#8321: 2021 i didnt get to finish my game
 JR Coder#8321: game jam lesgo
 Lawn#1538: Have you put your own ad up on the finder or are you just asking others to join?
 birdstone#3073: heheheha i asked and got a day off
 BetterThanYou#4809: I need help finding a team i tried gmtk team finder but there are full any spots open I can code.
 Lawn#1538: There are just so many musicians and noise makers out there looking for teams that I don’t think you need to go the AI route.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Ah, damn...
 Lawn#1538: Not in the events business
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Damn... Y'all can save that for monday, surely.
 Tyler Hunter#0474: Anyone considering AI gen’d music?  Anyone have an links to decent setups to make passable stuff?
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: We should be fine, tho. I put together a team of people who are experienced and that I can trust. It's all a matter of how we perform come game time.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I had to work since sunday. So, I didn't get to spend as much time with the team as I wanted to, tho.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: It's going well! We got all of our stuff set up over the weekend. Now we're all just chillin, waiting for Friday.
 Lawn#1538: Set up your VCS and all that sharing jazz?
 Lawn#1538: How’s the 11 human team going ?
 Lawn#1538: It’s actually past midday here, but my sleep schedule is missing
 Lawn#1538: Mornin’
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Hi Lawn!
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Hi Chief!
 Snickerzilla#4948: Alr awesome :)
 theChief#0001: That's right, yeah
 Snickerzilla#4948: I'm trying to choose central time, is that UTC-6?
 Snickerzilla#4948: Wait I thiiink I might have it
 theChief#0001: What's confusing? Maybe I can help clear it up!
 Snickerzilla#4948: Jeez the timezone options when creating a post are kind of confusing to me xddd
 Henry_Hamster#4240: No problem!
 Bronsolo#4491: I am. Thank you for clearing that up.
 nekiwo#7574: you seem like a great parent!
 Henry_Hamster#4240: discord messsages/dms wont if you click the other option, it will(assuming you are talking about the channel thing)
 Bronsolo#4491: Yeah I've been putting out several  messages. Will every request pop up on the team-finder server?
 Henry_Hamster#4240: uhh if a person doesnt immediately reply, then it should be fine, just keep your options open, if a team is fully considering you I would say wait(I got ditched by an artist during consideration D:, no hard feelings though) Personal opinion though
 Snickerzilla#4948: When searching for a team, should I contact more than one person loL?
 wyrm_slayr#7477: Cool
 VulpineMachine#2173: Minecraft, Satisfactory, Raft, Mechwarrior 5, Fallout 76, Borderlands, No Man's Sky... stuff like that.
 wyrm_slayr#7477: What kinda games do you play?
 VulpineMachine#2173: I've built the two older ones computers an we all play stuff together all the time. co-op on PC is like our thing. 😄
 wyrm_slayr#7477: That's awesome
 VulpineMachine#2173: It's challenging, but yeah, my boys have risen to the occasion and taught me to be better. I mean, they love games, we play games together, they love the idea of game development. Idk if they can help, but I'm thinking we can do this as a team thing. 😄
 wyrm_slayr#7477: 👌
 VulpineMachine#2173: like "oh man, if I can handle this thing, then what can't I handle?"
 VulpineMachine#2173: nah nah, it's all good. It makes you stronger y'know?
 wyrm_slayr#7477: Dang, sorry to hear that.
 VulpineMachine#2173: Yeah I've got a son that's a T1D, a son that's got hyperinsulinism, and an 8 month old son. I never sleep already. XD
 wyrm_slayr#7477: Just make sure to stay hydrated and get sleep :)
 VulpineMachine#2173: Thanks. I figured y'all would be supportive. I am in really really strung out shape, but at the same time, I really would like to try to tackle something fun (even if I will 100% fall flat on my face! haha)
 Henry_Hamster#4240: Go for it if you think you have the motivation, just choose something that you can finish but most importantly don't work yourself out too hard, your health is still more important than this game jam
 Henry_Hamster#4240: I have a general one, but yeah the specifics need to be changed
 Scolon#4218: I have an AudioManager I use for a lot of different projects but I'm probably just going to reprogram for this one
 wyrm_slayr#7477: Still takes time
 Henry_Hamster#4240: also audio manager for me is normally game specific and splash screen design as well, like ig you can have the buttons there
 Scolon#4218: The worst thing that can happen is that you don't submit anything, I'd go for it :)
 Henry_Hamster#4240: well if its that common you can just like ctrl+c ctrl+v during the jam idk, doesnt seem too necessary
 wyrm_slayr#7477: Dew it
 VulpineMachine#2173: So I have been really busy moving and had thought I missed the game jam...but I see it's still on. I'm completely, absolutely, unbelievably tired. Been taking care of my three kids by myself, unpacking by myself, running the family business by myself, and my health is definitely suffering. That said... I really still kinda want to participate now that my computer is up and running again. It seems crazy, I don't even know if I can get much if anything done, but...idk, should I even try, what do you guys think?
 Henry_Hamster#4240: Oh yeah, try uploading something to itch first, remember to set compression to none in unity else it wont work
 wyrm_slayr#7477: I mean just stuff like splash screen, scene manager, audio manager, etc. The kind of things that I'd do for every game anyways
 Scolon#4218: Biggest killer is not submitting until you're done only to realize the build isn't working and you only have like 1 hour left
 Scolon#4218: Make sure you can compile and submit builds properly.
 Henry_Hamster#4240: I wouldn't suggest making a template project since thats tbh kinda not in the spirit and unless you wanna mold your game to the theme instead of the other way around you cant do much either
 wyrm_slayr#7477: Lol that's what my mom is for :P
 Henry_Hamster#4240: More importantly snacks, a lot of water, an easy way to communicate, and a lot of sleep
 RocketCow#5210: Meals.
 wyrm_slayr#7477: What are the biggest things y'all would suggest I prepare beforehand for the jam? I've done a few before but this'll be the first time I actually make a template project Lol.
 Scolon#4218: Honestly i've just been doing so much practice and experimentation it'll be fun to finally release something
 WorkingJoe#4433: It's hard to decide how much time to dedicate to some aspect
 Henry_Hamster#4240: well it looks nice and it is thik so all is good
 WorkingJoe#4433: Where I should honestly just have drawn a flowmap and slapped some textured onto that
 birdstone#3073: lmfao true but still that sort of thing is really cool to me
 birdstone#3073: i'd love to learn how shaders work and understand them without things like shader graph
 WorkingJoe#4433: It's way too overengineered though ;) like 6 compute shaders working in tandem
 birdstone#3073: i love these kinds of shaders damn, good job
 Ash Badas#2999: Not yet. But I have confidence on myself when it comes to such things. So... Guess I'll answer this next year. Lol
 birdstone#3073: ~~definitely didn't happen to me a few minutes ago~~
 Henry_Hamster#4240: a little overspecific but yeah kinda... although for me it normally goes back to normal cause I havent' burnt it that bad before
 Henry_Hamster#4240: :))
 Ash Badas#2999: I fixed it :)
 birdstone#3073: off topic but you guys ever burn the roof of your mouth and have that part extremely hypersensitive within the next few days
 Henry_Hamster#4240: And this is why robbery is not a crime(/jk dont sue me please)
 birdstone#3073: oh no
 WorkingJoe#4433: I tend to start huge technical projects with no game purpose
 nekiwo#7574: game dev companies: "what if we had productivity of a game jam but instead of 48 hours its a year"
 Henry_Hamster#4240: A little annoying when you are trying to push out a release before like the next decade :(.
 Henry_Hamster#4240: Good luck :D.
 Ash Badas#2999: Dude, true. I'm only able to make games during game jam
 birdstone#3073: hopefully i don't get another crippling headache like last year lmao
 Henry_Hamster#4240: What is wrong with some extra slow motion
 WorkingJoe#4433: How to get steam 2H playtime
 Henry_Hamster#4240: I normally procrastinate, but game jams are just amazing for me cause I can/have to fully focus. Actually, look at me procrastinate from Unity right now :DDD
 birdstone#3073: it is, and it's in it
I just did something wrong where there's a rare chance that the game gets locked in slow motion
 Henry_Hamster#4240: but slowmotion is noice...
 birdstone#3073: woooo good luck to you!
 WorkingJoe#4433: First time jamming in the hopes of getting rid of my habit of getting into analysis paralysis :P
 birdstone#3073: lmao i went too hard with the juice last time and produced a slowmotion bug that i couldn't fix because i was already enduring though a really painful headache
 Ash Badas#2999: 🆙
 WorkingJoe#4433: Biggest jam challenge: no overengineering
 wren#0640: speaking of which god i need to figure out godots particle system
 Scolon#4218: Yeah that's against the spirit
 Ash Badas#2999: Right 🌟 let's wait then
 Fraserfatt#1021: people love ***juice*** in games
 birdstone#3073: yeah that was also something i noticed
 birdstone#3073: lol even if you have the patience to do that i wouldn't recommend it, not that it's against the rules its more just not in the spirit of the jam
 wren#0640: people are definitely generally more forgiving to games with pretty ok gameplay but great polish and aesthetics than unpolished games with amazing gameplay i feel
 Ash Badas#2999: I'll go make a template for ever f.ing  genre I know 🙂 is that against the rule...
 Henry_Hamster#4240: Polish is the way to go, if only my brain would actually register that
 birdstone#3073: nekiwo's forming an army
 birdstone#3073: lol i seem to be overly focused on polish yet i did pretty well last jam
 nekiwo#7574: we are at 24 members
 Henry_Hamster#4240: Fair enough, but the most like polished and complete games are often big(or semi) teams, and I feel like thats for a valid reason, however they are not **always** good
 wren#0640: didnt notice that til now
 wren#0640: oh huh
 wren#0640: theres always a good few solo teams in marks top 20
 Ash Badas#2999: Cool
 birdstone#3073: don't forget basic human functions and have fun, it'll be a great experience
 Ash Badas#2999: Best of luck mate
 birdstone#3073: this'll be my third time and adding another friend as a team member
 Henry_Hamster#4240: I can just imagine the winner being some team of 40 people, or actually, maybe just some random studio who felt like having some fun
 Ash Badas#2999: Totally man 😂 jk, But it must be very difficult to mannage 11 people. And if they are all stranger, you'll must be production wizards to pull that off
 M_Raven#4076: This is going to be my second time, and my first time with a team
 darlingS#1797: This is my first jam and I am nervexcited
 Ash Badas#2999: This is probably my 3rd year and I've never submitted once to GMTK 😕
 Henry_Hamster#4240: ??? this is my first gmtk game jam but ive done others before
 Ash Badas#2999: Dude, make me 12th
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: RIP you a new one?
 Scolon#4218: The real theme is the friends we've made along the way
 Henry_Hamster#4240: well if thats the case then rip me
 tykenn#8548: Just taking inspiration from outside other games can often be educational without being a tutorial. It'd actually be cool to see some games from people's niche hobbies that don't get explored often in games
 Henry_Hamster#4240: just prerecord the game, amazing
 NoelJasik#8768: my idea would be following a youtube tutorial
 birdstone#3073: hi it's brian from statefarm
 Henry_Hamster#4240: or the other idea is just a puzzle game with rules which you have to learn, I remembe rseeing that somewhere
 yugioh#7402: Ok i will go try forcing myself to translate
Bye everyone
 Henry_Hamster#4240: fair enough, but thats what my brian goes to first, some 'tutorial' which turns out to be an actual game
 Henry_Hamster#4240: Ive made a few but its just a bunch of pain, even when interactive
 NoelJasik#8768: It doesn't have to be a tutorial, like you can teach stuff without them
 Henry_Hamster#4240: Please no I don;t enjoy making tutorials
 NoelJasik#8768: As the famouse walter brown said, it's cracking time
 birdstone#3073: you're like those hollow knight lore youtubers that make like a 1 hour analysis of a 2 minute trailer
 NoelJasik#8768: The theme will be related to teaching in some form or another, i am willing to bet 5 bucks on that
 Henry_Hamster#4240: What ancient knowledge
 Murten#0001: Amen.
 Roiboi#2055: As soon as seeing the "theme" written in all caps, I knew something was up. Clearly the *real* theme is encoded within this one...
First I tried reversing the phrase. "SRESOL ROF ERA STNAP". Doesn't seem that useful, but there's more to it...
Putting the phrase into a UTF-8 decoder results in "I8ND@I3@." If you consider "8" to be "ate," "3" to be "e," and "@" to be "at," you get "latendatleat."
At this point I was a bit stuck, but eventually I realized: it was *scrambled.*
latendatleat
late at dental
At last, the elusive phrase had revealed itself. "Late At Dental." Clearly, the true theme for the jam, missing a dentist appointment.
 birdstone#3073: "Do you think Vecna from Stranger Things has to do poos and wees"
- Mark Brown
 Henry_Hamster#4240: "Trust the Sun Tzu quotes" -Sun Tzu (The Art of Trust 2018)
 Murten#0001: "If it's in quotations it should be taken as fact" - Sun Tzu (writer of sesame street)
 Henry_Hamster#4240: "But someone famous said it"-probably not someone famous
 Murten#0001: That's a lie.
 birdstone#3073: *i can-*
 Henry_Hamster#4240: "If you try hard enough you can do anything"-somebody famous idk
 Murten#0001: Yet people won't stop trying.
 yugioh#7402: Ohhh gotcha
 Murten#0001: It's a music piece made to be impossible to play.
 yugioh#7402: I never heard about rush b before tbh
 Murten#0001: I know the entire lyrics of rush b.
 birdstone#3073: i can play the first "playable" parts of rush e on double bass
 WorkingJoe#4433: Давай давай B B B B!!!
 Murten#0001: They spoke jet engine.
 yugioh#7402: Yeah you can
 lilburlap#8480: Can I just scream incoherently to achieve the same effect against non-russian speakers?
 RocketCow#5210: Rush B, become as god
 Murten#0001: It was great fun ngl. There mics sounded about the same a an SU-27 taking of with full afterburner.
 WorkingJoe#4433: Just put on a phat Russian accent and learn the swearwords
 birdstone#3073: written russian looks so intimidating
 yugioh#7402: I gotta learn Russian first
 WorkingJoe#4433: Become the screaming Russian
 birdstone#3073: lmfao damn
 WorkingJoe#4433: You have to embrace that part to have fun
 yugioh#7402: That's an interaction ig
 Murten#0001: Comp games never really worked for me. I always just ended up messing around while some Russian was screaming in my ear to go plant the bomb.
 birdstone#3073: i can see why that works for people
 Murten#0001: I joined up with someone for the first time for this jam.
 lilburlap#8480: I'm kinda the opposite, if I'm playing a competitive game it doesn't feel like there's a point unless I either have a friend to talk to or I'm trying to learn from what other people are doing. I am also going solo because my friends aren't big into gamedev and I am a born and bred backseat gamer.
 WorkingJoe#4433: I'm a huge Titanfall 2 tryhard \:s
 Murten#0001: Damn, I forgot about that one.
 tykenn#8548: I like individual competitive games. Team competitive stresses me out because I know I'm letting my team down. Coincidentally, I'm going solo this jam.
 RocketCow#5210: Stand alone complex is *very* good, though
 birdstone#3073: i think i have a video clip of my friends yelling and screaming and breaking things at a game of monopoly
obv i won't show it but i thought the description itself was funny
 Murten#0001: They made a bunch of things to try and profit of the perfection that is ghost in the shell but the only thing worth watching is the original. I've never played the psp game though. Might have to try and get my hands on a copy.
 RocketCow#5210: Ghost in the shell never had any really *good* video games, surprisingly
 RocketCow#5210: It does, and that game is *mediocre at best*
 lilburlap#8480: I play bedrock minecraft servers with my little brother sometimes it's pretty fun
 yugioh#7402: Tho i only have super Mario party
 yugioh#7402: I like playing party games with my lil sis
 birdstone#3073: yeah i don't really like games that have a really competitive environment, i'm a big fan of party and casual games
 DrNukeLear#2414: The original anime movie is amazing, the rest less so.
 yugioh#7402: Fun fact it's have a psp game iirc
 lilburlap#8480: I like multiplayer when you can have a bunch of fun interactions with people but I'm not a big fan of Micing up with strangers so it's usually just minecraft with family and close friends
 birdstone#3073: oo i might give that a try too
vulf and ghost in the shell
 Murten#0001: Have you ever seen the movie?
 birdstone#3073: i'll note that for later, i might try it
 WorkingJoe#4433: Also FearOfDark makes great chiptune (it's great)
 yugioh#7402: I love i do
 Murten#0001: Ghost in the shell is so good.
 birdstone#3073: i listen to classical music like dvorak and vivaldi but at the same time i also listen to the doom + doom eternal soundtrack
 yugioh#7402: True true
 WorkingJoe#4433: It's funky stuff, pretty high energy is what I mean
 DrNukeLear#2414: I used to watch his show when he was starting out and then he became over sensationalist and just did surface level hot takes.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I only play Fortnite with my fam and close friends.
 yugioh#7402: I never tried Fortnite before i don't like online games tbh
 birdstone#3073: i've never heard of vulf but intense music helps me focus lol
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Lmao.
 RocketCow#5210: To answer the question, I usually put on the Ghost In the Shell soundtrack.
 yugioh#7402: The real theme has appeared
 Murten#0001: I love Fortnite.
 lilburlap#8480: I uh, I mean there's a half-broken fan going in the background but these headphones are mostly for show
 birdstone#3073: lmao i'm getting so many signs to start playing majoras mask
 Murten#0001: Heavy metal/ rock or Jpop; and sometimes I like to listen to peach pit.
 RocketCow#5210: That's a good one.
 WorkingJoe#4433: I love Vulf, but may be a bit too intense.
 birdstone#3073: ooo old jazz
 tykenn#8548: right now I'm listening to Time's End by Theophany
 WorkingJoe#4433: The team finder is like applying for a job levels of fun lol
 yugioh#7402: I think miles Davis
 Murten#0001: I love my punctuation.
 lilburlap#8480: I've seen that in my youtube recommended but never checked it out
 birdstone#3073: what kinds of music do you guys listen to that helps you focus?
 Murten#0001: This upsets me.
 yugioh#7402: Nope iirc
 tykenn#8548: Does he at least have a dice theme going on with his channel/blog/whatever he does?
 yugioh#7402: I'm sorry I thought he was famous enough to know him but looks like I'm wrong sorry again
 RocketCow#5210: His show is "Zero Punctuation"
 Murten#0001: You really should have specified that lmao. I have no clue who that is.
 yugioh#7402: Yeah he has some not so good takes imo
 yugioh#7402: Lol i see
 RocketCow#5210: Witty writer, some takes on games suffer from his format. Such is life.
 birdstone#3073: OH LOL, i don't think i've seen any of their reviews
 Murten#0001: Fun when bored. Not really something I play when I have a deck of cards available though.
 lilburlap#8480: Are we reviving the redline revolution? /j
 yugioh#7402: I'm talking about the game reviewer sorry if i wasn't clear
 birdstone#3073: never played it
 tykenn#8548: Since pants give you negative points, you shoot pants away from you to increase your score while allowing you to move
 yugioh#7402: So I'm curious what's everyone opinion about Yahtzee
 RocketCow#5210: if everybody accepts it as the theme, what Mark says no longer matters.
 Finnder#9913: im confirming it
 Finnder#9913: it is the theme
 birdstone#3073: *nothing is impossible*
 Murten#0001: There is a chance.
 RocketCow#5210: *it might be*
 birdstone#3073: **no, i think it is**
 Murten#0001: You don't know that.
 yugioh#7402: Yeah we know
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: **THIS ISN'T ACTUALLY THE THEME, BTW.**
 yugioh#7402: And dresses
 Murten#0001: I only wear a skirt and programming socks.
 yugioh#7402: Only wearing thawb
 birdstone#3073: my mind is churning with ideas
 tykenn#8548: I actually could get behind that theme
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I found it.
 tykenn#8548: GMTK jam will keep growing until everyone in the world has made a game
 birdstone#3073: same, i also placed an order for the hoodie the day of the announcement
 Murten#0001: Last year had a lot of people join because of COVID. That's going to be a tough to beat.
 Scolon#4218: Yeah I'm signed up for a lot of game jams this summer
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I have memes! From last years GMTK!
 BurnV06#5857: I signed up the day the announcement video dropped
 Scolon#4218: Watch a ton of people sign-up last minute
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Will it top last year, tho?
 birdstone#3073: lol it seems it gets bigger and bigger every year
 Scolon#4218: It gets bigger and bigger eveyr year
 birdstone#3073: outside of the global game jam the gmtk jam seems to be the biggest online jam
 BurnV06#5857: Maybe
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Is this going to be the biggest GMTK?
 tykenn#8548: heard about the unity thing. No idea what the implications are
 BurnV06#5857: 17.4k joined
 Scolon#4218: yeah so 41 hours remain
 birdstone#3073: unity merging with ironwhateveritscalled
 yugioh#7402: Oh sorry for starting this
 Kira#7896: The what?
 RocketCow#5210: sets a bad precident though, so let's not.
 birdstone#3073: why don't we just move away from this conversation
 yugioh#7402: Idm it
 Amit.H#0786: Not cool.
 birdstone#3073: please don't remind me of that
 null_ham#2050: ayo did yall hear about the unity adware thing
 Murten#0001: 10/10 would smash.
 yugioh#7402: My profile pic is me using a gender swap filter
 Murten#0001: I do. I'm just messing with you.
 BurnV06#5857: I thought it was a sheep
 RocketCow#5210: See that's why make your profile picture a meme. ~~because you're dead inside~~
 Scolon#4218: Oh, that's what that is. I never clicked on your profile picture and assumed it was an island with a volcano on it giving off smoke
 Amit.H#0786: Hope you understand
 Amit.H#0786: Just trying to prevent any bullying
 Murten#0001: No fun allowed.
 birdstone#3073: i too am my profile picture, i am a low poly tree
 Amit.H#0786: We’ll leave dating sites for that.
 Murten#0001: What would you rate me based on  my profile picture? (I'm very attractive.)
 birdstone#3073: welcome back scolon
 yugioh#7402: Hi
 BurnV06#5857: Hello
 Scolon#4218: Hi jammers
 yugioh#7402: Thx
 birdstone#3073: take a 9 or 10 from me
 birdstone#3073: lol unfortunately i don't really know how to rate
 yugioh#7402: So what do you all think how much would you rate me
 Murten#0001: My profile picture is my face.
 Jeker#3389: Dude i look like a fucking decomposed grape fruit
 Murten#0001: That kitchen has some intense colours.
 Murten#0001: Ah, thank you. Good to know.
 Jeker#3389: (Doesent always refer to a man)
 Murten#0001: Or woman. I don't know if fiance always refers to a man or not. English is not my first language.
 ChichoRD#0598: Well, finally my art and sound will come in handy, I'm mainly a programmer
 Jeker#3389: Here buddy hold this L (lol)
 Murten#0001: Smart man.
 birdstone#3073: ouch
 RocketCow#5210: OOOOOOH
 birdstone#3073: lmao that sounds like a fun relationship
 yugioh#7402: My fiance says I'm prettier than her
 Peter#0007: for now 😈 (joking, congrats!)
 yugioh#7402: Thx
 birdstone#3073: ooo congratulations
 yugioh#7402: Oh and also i have a fiance
 yugioh#7402: Can we share our selfies
 Jeker#3389: I somehow have a girlfriend
 M_Raven#4076: I wish I was an 8/10 😔
 RocketCow#5210: I'm a 4/10, unless I ahve a lot of time to stage a photo
 yugioh#7402: I think I'm a 8/10 tbh
 Jeker#3389: Fuck i wanted to write that lol
 RocketCow#5210: It would have gone through centuries of mutation on both ends, so that's not a big surprise.
 thefatkazachus#2461: lmao
 BurnV06#5857: I’d upload a picture of my face
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: What if the theme was: ||Repulsive||?
 yugioh#7402: That's weird those words have completely different meanings from what i know
 M_Raven#4076: I used to be, but then my school offered a Unity course so now I know Unity better
 Commarchinin#4804: No worries!
 ChichoRD#0598: Imagine if the theme of the jam is magnetism, bruh
 Jeker#3389: Oh, yeah I think i have heard of it, well thanks for the recommendations!
 RocketCow#5210: The biggest example being the famous "Olé", which, as far as we can trace, came from the word "allah".
 BurnV06#5857: Los sientos no habla griega
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: yeah i've heard that too! it's a wonderful language and honestly i feel like i really should get to actually learn it. since both of my parents are from way different areas of the island they had way different dialects so they didn't speak it much when i was a kid
 yugioh#7402: That's interesting tbh
 Commarchinin#4804: I would also highly recommend clojure as a language worth learning. Mostly from a 'changes the way you think about programming' angle.
 RocketCow#5210: Spanish, in turn, has a surprising amount of loan words from arab, due to the moorish occupation.
 Maikha#4246: who's with godot?
 BurnV06#5857: I’ve heard Sardinian is the closest modern romance language to classical latin
 Jeker#3389: Εχουμε δικα μας γραμματα ξερεις
 RocketCow#5210: And also some french words, thanks to Napoleon.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: are we talking languages? i'm from sardinia, and from what i understand sardinian (language from here) is actually really close to catalan because of the occupation of the spanish of sardinia that happened historically
 RocketCow#5210: Thanks to the romans and their conquest you can find words that transcend language all over Europe. Especially if you read a language.
 Jeker#3389: Yeah no not to that extend lol
 BurnV06#5857: Yo aprendando español por cuatro años
 Jeker#3389: Oh, yeah you are right, i should probably learn python, since aside from the fact its used everywhere, it could have made my life so much easier in certain projects, which i over complicated by using C# or something and speed wasnt really needed there
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Huh. That's crazy. Makes a lot more sense now. That's pretty cool. I know Spanish and ~~Filipino~~ Tagalog share many words too.
 Commarchinin#4804: That's cool. Honestly there's usually not much C experience around, so having done a stack of C is probably enough to get you embedded type roles.
If you haven't done any higher level stuff, I do recommend doing some higher level projects. Being comfortable in more than one language is very useful 
 yugioh#7402: Good night cat sweet dreams
 Catfish#2063: Shi* am just gonna sleep gn
 Jeker#3389: Yeah, Greek and Spanish share a few words actually, and the accents are similar from what i've heard
 RocketCow#5210: Well, they spoke *some* latin in the HRE, so the language as a spoken language didn't *die* until a few hundred years ago, with the big excemption of church latin.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I feel like I will run into a similar problem with how I hear portuguese. I feel like I can understand them. But, when I *"tune into my Spanish channels"* I can't understand shit. Lol.
 JuliusCube#8501: *thousand
 flameguy21#8407: Yeah, I thought they just switched to english at some point. I hear NOTHING from modern day Greece.
 Catfish#2063: Lol
 RocketCow#5210: *Latin*
You're a few hundred years late there.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: There was this Greek guy that I met that spoke to me in such fluent spanish I thought he was hispanic. He also spoke english. Was pretty cool guy.
 JuliusCube#8501: to be honest spanish and italian are so similar that you could probably understand most of what someone is saying
in other words, learning italian would be simple if you already know spanish
 Catfish#2063: I just love and hate German for some reason, like man u got the best grammar and some of the vocab r just killing
 flameguy21#8407: Didn't know greece had a language. I thought it was latin lol
 M_Raven#4076:  It turns out the majority of us are only in the team server to spectate or occasionally help out, so we're actually more like a team of 6 or 7
 Jeker#3389: I know Greek, some German and English
 Catfish#2063: Now looking forward to work in Australia or Japan
 yugioh#7402: That's pretty cool ngl
 yugioh#7402: I'm translating from English to Arabic i only know those two
 Catfish#2063: A branch of my family is Arab and I used to live in saudi
 Jeker#3389: Well, thats pretty cool i'd say, right now i mostly have expirience either writting really low level code in C, or making my own tools/applications, in again, C but I am looking forward to doing more low level stuff since the only thing i've made that can be considered low level is a kernel and that was pretty basic
I only know English and Spanish. But, I plan to learn some Italian soon.
 Catfish#2063: That job is awesome
 yugioh#7402: Cool
 yugioh#7402: I have a gig where i translate research papers for university students
 Catfish#2063: Ik some arabic
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: What are you translating?
 Catfish#2063: Rip
 NoelJasik#8768: it's 1 am
 yugioh#7402: I gotta translate but i don't have motivation
 Catfish#2063: It's summer
 yugioh#7402: 🫂
hbu?
 yugioh#7402: Yoooo hi shadow how's your day going
 Commarchinin#4804: That's 100% me too. I'm a qualified electrical engineer, but because I have a background in code I've ended up writing code in support of engineering projects (and I just happen to work at a shop where the projects that really need code are R&D)
 Catfish#2063: I get where Ur coming from I hate it too when someone does it, that was miss from
 yugioh#7402: Lebanese are more liberal from what i know tho I'm not sure I'm not living there
 NoelJasik#8768: Sure i get that, i just dislike generalizing peapole
 M_Raven#4076: UPDATE: It was not the UserSettings, it was the Library folder
 Catfish#2063: So they support it, I think Lebanese do to
 yugioh#7402: Yeah
 Jeker#3389: Yeah, I think thats also really cool, generally i was kinda split for the most part on wether i want to follow computer science or electrical engineering, so might as well land kind off in the middle i guess lol
 Catfish#2063: But ig it's(not), u live in Iraq right?
 Commarchinin#4804: Yeah, that's a cool area. Pretty nightmarish to debug, is my experience, but a nice thing about embedded is your working products at the end of a project are often really physical, hands on things. Which is super cool.
 Catfish#2063: Idk but the probability is so high of getting a no from Arabs if asked about LGBTQ
 yugioh#7402: They might be more liberal
 yugioh#7402: Yeah true
 NoelJasik#8768: Majority, here i could agree for sure, but majority isn't everyone, like he said it like all arabs are the same
 Jeker#3389: I am looking towards something like embeded systems/embeded software engineer, cause well I think it might be a cool job, also coding in C
 yugioh#7402: Tho i don't know about arabs in western countries
 yugioh#7402: Nope the big majority don't support lgbt people take that from me an arab
 Catfish#2063: Ask ali
 Catfish#2063: Idk
 NoelJasik#8768: Aren't arabs like a big group of peapole? some probably do while others don't
 Jeker#3389: Wow, scientific computing that actually sounds like a cool job
 Finnder#9913: Programmers love to make jokes with blank faces
 Commarchinin#4804: Yep, followed by LISP
 yugioh#7402: Nope they haven't started to do that sadly I'm a black sheep
 Finnder#9913: Agreeable
 Catfish#2063: Wow Arabs started supports LGBTQ+ that's nice long live LGBTQ
 Jeker#3389: Another fun fact, Fortran was also technically the first high level language if i recall correctly
 RocketCow#5210: Hey, we have *at least* two jokes, if not more.
 NoelJasik#8768: There's no fun, programming is a serious buisness and we are just as fun as germans
 Commarchinin#4804: Fair enough, I work in scientific computing so I've been exposed to stuff in Fortran and actually done work in some other remarkably old languages (e.g., Franz Lisp), which is probably why that went over my head
 yugioh#7402: Yup iraqi
 yugioh#7402: Bye good night
 Catfish#2063: Wait Ur middle Eastern?
 Finnder#9913: Whats the fun in that tho
 NoelJasik#8768: so that's a valid choice, also why chat delay is so long, like kinda makes harder to talk
 NoelJasik#8768: Well you could technically just copy and paste code from a repo instead of forking
 Catfish#2063: Ok 👌 I will just sleep and try it tomorrow anyways
 yugioh#7402: I thought about the same joke
 Finnder#9913: If ur not forking then what are you doing with ur life
 Jeker#3389: Oh yeah thats also a choice good luck mate
 RocketCow#5210: fork knight, the sequel to shovel knight
 Catfish#2063: Js is easier to code in so ig I will compile js to an exe executable or watever platform
 NoelJasik#8768: I too am too young and thought of forknight
 Finnder#9913: Idk about ya'll but I code in Fortnight every day
 Jeker#3389: As  said, look up emscrippten, it allows you to compile to web assembly, meaning you can run the game on a browser, but also give you the ability to compile to an exe, using a traditional compiler, such as gcc g++ or clang
 RocketCow#5210: my dude, that was a joke based on Fortran being ancient.
 Commarchinin#4804: Common misconception, Fortran really isn't any faster than C these days. It used to be, because it had the compilers first, and lots of high performance libraries were written in Fortran. But these days most of the high performance libraries people care about are hand coded assembly, and C compilers are similar if not slightly better than the modern Fortran ones
 Catfish#2063: People just use godot
 RocketCow#5210: Because user settings may vary depending on the project, considering that you can write *almost anything* to them.
 Jeker#3389: Ohhhh man unity's kinda dumb lol
 Catfish#2063: Yes I made like 3 games this way
 nekiwo#7574: why does unity put user specific settings individually to each project 😢
 Jeker#3389: Sorry but, I dont understand what you are saying, do you write your game in JavaScript, then re-write it in C/C++ and SDL?
 Catfish#2063: 1950s programming language
 RocketCow#5210: Make your game in Fortnight or GTFO
 M_Raven#4076: The gitignore wasn't ignoring UserSettings, so when we pushed it would also push that folder. Then when we pulled it would somehow conflict with our local stuff and cause the engine to have a seizure
 Catfish#2063: Idk why I read it fortnight
 Jeker#3389: Oh, whats the thingy?
 Catfish#2063: The way I go about creating a game is coding it in js then code everything again in sdl2, js seems enough ig
But have anyone really tried
 Finnder#9913: finally someone gets me
 M_Raven#4076: I fixed it, it's a UserSettings thing
 RocketCow#5210: Don't talk to me if you don't write your game in Fortran
 Finnder#9913: Actually i've decided to switch to the punch cards for maximum performance
 Finnder#9913: ye
 Catfish#2063: Ur a genius , does that mean I can compile my js game to work on any platforms?
 Jeker#3389: Technically sdl can do that
 Catfish#2063: I made it too but it brought a couple of thousand lines
 Finnder#9913: imma make my game in assembly
 Catfish#2063: I don't use or I could just leave them however that would make them accessible to anyone downloading the game
 Commarchinin#4804: I have, but only for test code
 Jeker#3389: Take what i say with a grain of salt, but I think for an executable you need to attach the DLLs in a zip file
 Catfish#2063: That's why I just love it (emscriptern
 Commarchinin#4804: E.g., you can't launch web assembly without a JS wrapper (but Emscripten will generate the HTML and JS you need for you, at a pinch)
 Catfish#2063: So... Have u tried it before?
 Catfish#2063: Gotcha
 Commarchinin#4804: It converts to Web Assembly, but Web Assembly is JS-adjacent
 Catfish#2063: I really need to research that out
 BurnV06#5857: The human brain tends to subconciously sync it’s actions to background music
 Catfish#2063: Doesn't it convert to js
 Commarchinin#4804: By default, no, not cross platform. You can cross-compile to work on platforms other than your own, but that isn't easy. Emscripten is the solution I think most of us who are using SDL are going with - Emscripten is a compiler which converts the C to Web Assembly, which is then completely portable (because it runs in the browser)
 BurnV06#5857: Also, since it’s fast paced, it makes me more efficient
 Jeker#3389: I listen to a lot of twikipedia
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: 
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I listen to reggaeton.
 BurnV06#5857: I usually listen to hardcore dubstep because it motivates me
 Jeker#3389: I think, unity crashes without an ide cause of a null exepction
 M_Raven#4076: It's something with the User Settings, I think whenever I pull the new User Settings are causing my editor to have a seizure. Gonna update the repo to ignore UserSettings
 M_Raven#4076: ok ok I know what's up
 Jeker#3389: Does it give an error?
 Jeker#3389: Oh damn
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Yeah, I feel ya. I need to get myself back into it too.
 Äml#2258: that’s my go-to usually. but it takes some time to get over the procrastination of actually working lmaomao
 Murten#0001: Have you tried putting it in rice?
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Listen to a lofi hip hop playlist. You might be able to focus better with that. Idk. Lol.
 M_Raven#4076: It's no longer working 💀
 Jeker#3389: Uhhh i think i know why, but its kind off a long explanation
 Murten#0001: Music keeps me from getting distracted usually.
 Jeker#3389: Yeah, i'd say it makes it easier
 Murten#0001: Heavy metal or rock music; and sometimes I like Jpop.
 M_Raven#4076: nevermind no it isnt working
 M_Raven#4076: All I had to do was install Visual Studio??? How does the engine crash if I don't have the optional IDE???
Anyways it works now so I'm happy
 Äml#2258: can you code while hearing someone speak?
 K'miinik#3171: although i'd prefer talking to someone instead of the video
 K'miinik#3171: I have music playing and put on a video
 Jeker#3389: I usually put a video essay in the background
 Äml#2258: lol
 Äml#2258: in general. when i‘m working on a project it‘s half time youtube half time coding
 Murten#0001: Amphetamines.
 Xion | Mr. X#0183: I just throw all my distractions into another room.
 Murten#0001: What is sleep?
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: During the Jam or in general?
 Jeker#3389: So, lets see how much content i can spit out in the first few hours of the jam
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I still have an international team. So, idk if I'll actually sleep or not.
 Äml#2258: how do u guys stop urself from getting distracted???
 Xion | Mr. X#0183: I say that, but don't follow up on that lol
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: That's right. I'm actually gonna sleep this time.
 Jeker#3389: But hey, i dont really mind, i'll be going to acropolis again
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Me too. When I sleep.
 Jeker#3389: Ok so i might miss a few hours of the jam
 Finnder#9913: the good ol days
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Yes.
 Squishy Turtle#3988: I’m going back to good ol 2019 LTS for this jam
 Finnder#9913: yeah I would say so
 Roiboi#2055: should a character face the other direction if changing the movement direction in midair in a platformer?
 Teslobo#8274: An omen of the coming storm
 Xion | Mr. X#0183: lol
 Finnder#9913: gotta fix them c# errors
 M_Raven#4076: Watching Unity crash on startup got me going 😐
 Finnder#9913: which was 2 weeks ago
 Finnder#9913: for the summer I only get about a week break
 redve#6507: Do you have vacation?
 Finnder#9913: yeah I'm still deciding wither to do the jam or not. I've been studying for school 6-8 hours a day so idk if I should take the weekend off or not 😂
 redve#6507: Wanna make game together?
 Finnder#9913: that was my plan
 redve#6507: I will send this empty project to game jam, and pretend it's so deep philosophical game about life or something
 Fraserfatt#1021: it's art
 redve#6507: I mean, it's has nice gameplay etc
 redve#6507: I tried to compile some demo to web assembly, to run it in a browser.
It works as long, as the game is empty black rectangle XD
 redve#6507: I am fucked ig
 Peter#0007: Stealing your catchphrase
 Peter#0007: are you thinking of seedship by any chance?
I think I'm going to be making something along the lines of Epitaph or that one game about being a deep-space ship scanning for planets , or maybe A Dark Room - something _very_ simple to build in terms of visuals and UI, so I can spend my time working on the actual design.
Normally in jams I get very bogged down in the realities of the engine , so this time I want the shortest distance between my IDE and actual _design_
 Äml#2258: wdym text based website? sounds interesting
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: It's true! I'm making a tiny micro-game this year, am up for working with someone who has a cool vision that'd translate to a text-based website 😇
 Äml#2258: yeah but most people will work on their submission page directly after the submissions ended, which means there’s a bit of time before people start playing and rating your games. But of course it’s not the best idea not to plan the submission page beforehand
 Stopa#6148: That being said, there's a caveat: don't worry too much about the screenshots and thumbnail on Sunday evening. Last year the whole system was broken from the overload of people uploading images, so definitely don't waste your jam time trying to fight a nonresponsive server during the final hours of the jam.
 Stopa#6148: This is partly true. Iirc the rating starts as soon as the submissions close and even though technically it's not part of the game and should not affect the rating, the reality is that your submission page is a huge part of your presentation and will definitely have an impact on the player's experience and thus also the rating you receive. So if you care about the final rating of your game, you should make sure the submission page is in a decent state at the end of the jam.
 Peter#0007: oh cool the complete versions are on youtube now
 lilburlap#8480: It's on youtube
 Peter#0007: oh no it's not on netflix anymore rats
 Peter#0007: ok that's it i have to rewatch it now
 lilburlap#8480: ||The meta was such a good threat||
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Good times.
 lilburlap#8480: Yeah it was great
 Teslobo#8274: Ohhhh yeah, that's when the series acquires a plot
 lilburlap#8480: (Spoilers for rvb) ||It was when agent wash first appeared and it had the "dear chairman" and "Dear director" at the beginning of each episode||
 Teslobo#8274: Ngl I don't recall the hook of 6
 lilburlap#8480: Those are great but I definitely love the mysterious stuff happening in season 6
 Dragonite#5414: Of course the warmest weekend in the uk falls on the jam weekend
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I got me some Blood Gulch Blues
 Peter#0007: rvb’s soundtrack has some incredibly good and underappreciated tracks on it. After chorus it all kinda goes to hell from what I remember but what a run until then!
 Teslobo#8274: To my recollection seasons 8-10 is the best chunk of the show
 lilburlap#8480: Shadow I hope you feel remorse
 lilburlap#8480: I began yesterday
 Ibra#8468: *7 seasons in a day?*
 lilburlap#8480: Someone mentioned rvb yesterday and I would like to blame them for how I've binge watched up to season 7 since then
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: in practice people who should be working on their game are frequently also readily available in the help channels
 ESC#8775: I'm wondering, should I join a team?
 Teslobo#8274: In addition to participants there's often patrons that aren't participating but check in on the channels to answer queries
 Teslobo#8274: Historically the tech help channel has been active with helpers during the jam
 JuliusCube#8501: so when you upload the game, all you need to do is upload the game itself, publish and submit it, and only then should you actually edit the page to make it look good.
it saves a couple seconds for the game jam speedrunners and/or procrastinators out there.
 Ridley#0760: are people usually working on their own games and don't look at chat or can you usually get a question answered
 Ridley#0760: How responsive is it to ask for tech help during the jam, if I have no idea what I'm doing
 Teslobo#8274: The page should be fine yes, just not the file itself
 Seva Khusid#8784: Thumbnail, description, all that? Magnificent.
 JuliusCube#8501: yes, just you cant edit the game
 Lawn#1538: Yes.
 Seva Khusid#8784: Remind me, are we allowed to edit the game page after the deadline?
 Peter#0007: aight imma go sleep but can't wait for the jam on friday and i'll see ya all here! 🙂
 Peter#0007: ahh good to know, thank you!
 JuliusCube#8501: its ridiculously annoying to get tho
 Peter#0007: love the ||destroy spacetime|| speedrun
 JuliusCube#8501: its double ||, not single for spoilers
 JuliusCube#8501: and the guy who did it has the WR in every single category
ptminsker is crazy
 Peter#0007: huh, 7m57s
 JuliusCube#8501: as an outer wilds glitchhunter i can say that its crazy and you should go watch it
 Peter#0007: i wonder what the world record speedrun for outer wilds actually
 JuliusCube#8501: yes,nothing is stopping you from doing that particular series of events in your first loop
 Peter#0007: (from a perspective of new player; obviously if you know what you're doing you could do it faster)
 Peter#0007: you'd have to get *insanely* lucky with your timing to beat it in an hour
 JuliusCube#8501: if you take a look at outer wilds most of the puzzles there arent really puzzles
things there are hidden, and you often need a number of clues to find those things, but nothing is stopping you from brute forcing it and getting to a certain area accidentally, and nothing is stopping you from discovering everything you need to know in order to beat the game within an hour of starting.
 BadPiggy#5202: I remember the among us variant of that meme more than the actual one lol
 Peter#0007: ❤️  glad you appreciated, it works in so many scenarios
 Lawn#1538: I still screen them so it’s not all lost. Perfect GIF btw.
 Peter#0007: we could just round it up to "game"
 BadPiggy#5202: That might make things worse lol
Leaving it at " puzzle game " should do
 Peter#0007: v sad 😦 no gif embeds for me
 JuliusCube#8501: goddammit its not always about the puzzles
lots of times it isnt even about the puzzles
how about "open world puzzle game" then if you insist
 Lawn#1538: ~~Tedious walking puzzle games~~
 Peter#0007: strand-type game
 BadPiggy#5202: Puzzle game
 JuliusCube#8501: lets give it a new name then
 BadPiggy#5202: But then again .....
player progression is still progression
 BadPiggy#5202: People won't be smart enough to see things that way kek
 Peter#0007: you unlock knowledge (skills) using skill points (money to buy game) and experience (time spent staring at a line puzzle)
 JuliusCube#8501: i wasnt the guy who came up with the term, I agree.
 BadPiggy#5202: Oh Kay
But idk if I'd put the name metroid next to any of those games
I mean yes in Obra din, parts of the ship open up only after you figure things out, but you don't unlock more abilities or anything like that
If you put the name " metroid " in the genre, people will think you unlock abilities and there's combat and stuff, which would be misleading
 Peter#0007: 🤣
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: yeah, i just personally don't see the need for the term. like in the end i Cannot stop people from using it lmao, it's just that it feels a bit too close to metroidvanias themselves?
 Lawn#1538: Blocked off by puzzles. It’s a puzzle game.
 Catfish#2063: i found a software called wine that runs exe on linux
 theChief#0001: Tbh the itch app actually fixes a lot of issues with permissions iirc
 JuliusCube#8501: so you know how in a metroidvania certain things/areas are blocked off until you have a certain ability, power-up, etc? In metroidbrainias things are blocked off until you know something or figure something out.
 Peter#0007: ah but sure what's the difference between rock and classic rock, and rock and roll, and so on. genres are by their own nature very fuzzy and arbitrary
 Lawn#1538: It’s a puzzle game with walking lol.
 Lawn#1538: This is the best way to find out.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: for me to metroidbrania to be a valid term i think the structure these games takes would need to be radically different from metroidvanias as a whole
 BadPiggy#5202: Again, what da heck is a metroidbrainia now ? Lol
 JuliusCube#8501: have you seen any sorta metroidbrainia games and compared them to metroidvania games? the gameplay is entirely different.
look at one screenshot of the witness, outer wilds, return of the obra dinn, etc. and compare it to a screenshot of ori, hollow knight, metroid dread, etc.
You will see how radically different they are.
 DrNukeLear#2414: *downloads itch.io app for testing purposes*
 redve#6507: I hope it will work
 Peter#0007:   you should make a flowchart that's literally just two arrows and three blobs; does it run from the itch.io app? yes/no. and then link it every time
 dardasaba#9759: I guess just add a browser export in case these things happen (and it's good to have anyways)
 Lawn#1538: Mark runs the game from the itch.io app. If it doesn’t run from there, then you’re out of luck. I don’t know how to be clearer than I already have been.
 dardasaba#9759: Yes, I've encountered this before in some of my games, when windows marked them as possible viruses because they're "unsigned" executables
 redve#6507: Because when i tested some demo games like a week ago in virtual machine, it was detected as virus.
Defender even detects code written in windows as virus
 Lawn#1538: Double click the exe, game runs. That’s how simple it needs to be.
 Peter#0007: brb shipping a c++ compiler with my project so you can compile it yourself. "zero" effort
 DrNukeLear#2414: Why would you need to turn defender off?
 Lawn#1538: It needs to run with no extra effort. If Mark does play your game, make his life easier. Or he’s less likely to do so.
 Peter#0007: metroidcaneia: a genre which exclusively refers to metroid-esque games that feature walking sticks and canes
 redve#6507: I don't see nothing about windows defender. It has to run on windows, and it should, if you turn defender off
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: to me it's not a suuuuuuuuuper useful term then when you get to the very gritty of what makes a metroidvania a metroidvania - i think separating the two is going to hurt both kinds of games in the long run, honestly
 Lawn#1538: Please read the rules. 
 JuliusCube#8501: i think they accidentally replied to the wrong person yeah
 Lawn#1538: Wrong reply my bad
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: oh misclicked reply
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: ? what did i say?
 BadPiggy#5202: Also, " Dust an elysian tale " is basically this
 JuliusCube#8501: it separates the games i like from the games i like a lot
 JuliusCube#8501: its not microscopic and it does do things
 BadPiggy#5202: Even if I actually did a commercial beat-em-up, I'd do more of a linear beat-em-up.
Metroidvanias aren't my thing tbh
 DrNukeLear#2414: You should do a Metroidbeatemania.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i don't really like the term, honestly. it feels like this microscopic sub-categorization that doesn't really do anything but just separate games that are really very similar and just differ in small ways
 redve#6507: If i create a game, which will be blocked by windows defender, will i be disqualified?
 JuliusCube#8501: basically its a new term that was created because of the rise in diversity of the videogames that are being created
 BadPiggy#5202: Da heck is a metroidbania lol
 JuliusCube#8501: its a new-ish term that was created because of the rise in the number of games that are metroidbrainia-y
10 years ago there were very few games that could be considered metroidbrainias
 Peter#0007: is metroidbrainia a recognized used term now because holy moley i love it
 DrNukeLear#2414: Totally different pace, but similar structure
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: well yeah, because a metroidvania is kind of a nebulous term that is mostly defining the way a game is structured - it just so happens that a lot of the time metroidvanias are also action games with platformer elements, but they dont have to be those things
 JuliusCube#8501: in my experience, playing a metriodvania and playing a metriodbrainia are entirely different experiences
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: ok, but if you know how to get the thing to progress in metroid vania, then you can progress anyway. it just so happens that metroidvanias have a more circuitous way to go about it
 JuliusCube#8501: like I said, its not always puzzles. Its more about "if you *know* this thing then you can get to this area" instead of "if you *have* this thing you can get to this area"
 Lawn#1538: Then you have all the answers you need.
 JuliusCube#8501: I have and its great.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: "puzzle" and "boss" become basically the same thing if you look from a far enough distance
 JuliusCube#8501: its not usually a puzzle though, its more of like how if you know something, then you can get to those locked areas
 Lawn#1538: I strongly recommend you play The Looker. It’ll tell you everything thing you need to know.
 JuliusCube#8501: okay yeah i could see that.
not always like that though.
 Lawn#1538: Definitely not.
 DrNukeLear#2414: Swap boss with puzzle. Defeating puzzle gives the player the training and skill to access said areas.
 JuliusCube#8501: oh my god metroid***brain***ia not metriod***van***ia
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: that seems like kind of a very small minute categorization that doesn't seem super useful as a whole?
 redve#6507: Really good random numbers generator if you combine it with person which doesn't know how to exit it, and with keylogger ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
 Lawn#1538: ~~You’re in a server full of computer nerds.~~ vim is not that niche.
 DrNukeLear#2414: Certain areas require different skills to access which you gain by defeating bosses. But the game is laid out so that earlier sections have side sections accessed by later skills encouraging exploration and revisiting areas.
 JuliusCube#8501: youre probably one of the few people who do, i bet many people here dont know what vim is
 redve#6507: Out of curiosity, am i the only one who use vim / neovim?
 JuliusCube#8501: if youve played any of them, though, youd understand what they are
 JuliusCube#8501: its a difficult concept to explain easily
 JuliusCube#8501: i know about boss keys
 JuliusCube#8501: nah metroid*brainia* not metroidvania
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: oh wait is metroidbrania a different thing from metroidvania
 redve#6507: HiMARS adventures ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i think it's a whole series called boss keys?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: yes, i believe by mark himself!
 redve#6507: Can your game involve policy?
 JuliusCube#8501: Is there any sort of game design video on metroidBrainia games (the witness, return of the obra dinn, outer wilds, tunic, etc.) and how their game design works because those are generally my favorite games and also I just want to make them.
 Catfish#2063: yes plss
 Tyrix#6647: i could try to run it on a console, but i guess that was not the idea?
 Catfish#2063: can u do it with the cmd
 Tyrix#6647: it just asks me what program to open it with if i double klick it
 Catfish#2063: i am bad at having frnds
 Catfish#2063: just double click ig also check the Main.o
 Tyrix#6647: open with what? (sorry doing multiple things at the same time)
 redve#6507: I am trying to run game from 2006 on linux, for last 2 days.
 Catfish#2063: i hope tyrix is fine
 Lawn#1538: You may have to ask an IRL friend or borrow a computer 
 Catfish#2063: thx for the help anyway
 Catfish#2063: wait why not? i usually test my games hours before the deadline
 JuliusCube#8501: youd need to ask someone with more experience in this sorta field than me
 Lawn#1538: Although, if you’re opening non browser games from itch, you may as well live, laugh, love.
 Catfish#2063: my pc is only 2gb rams so i need something small that only tests the software
 JuliusCube#8501: i dont know of any online ones (or if they even exist), but you can just download virtualbox
 GodOfPro#7302: so what i understood from the rules you can create a itch.io game page with text and thumbnails ect placed before the jam but not any builds is it correct ?
 Catfish#2063: yes can u help me find one, that would be more efficient for me too
 Lawn#1538: Definitely.
 Catfish#2063: ❤️
 JuliusCube#8501: still a good idea to put it in virustotal and use it in a vm and that sorta stuff.
 Catfish#2063: just open the placeholder app inside the debug
 Catfish#2063: yee thx
 Tyrix#6647: i am already downloading, just a sec 😉
 Lawn#1538: Catfish is not that suss. They got help with this earlier.
 Catfish#2063: do u know an online windows virtual machine?
 BadPiggy#5202: There's a very underrated game called " Unto the end " which does the same lol
 Catfish#2063: i just want to make sure i compiled it correctly since am using linux
 Catfish#2063: it's just an sdl2 game
 theChief#0001: Immediately suspicious of that link
 JuliusCube#8501: I have almost won multiple game jams all by myself and I actually want to win one by myself before I actually start working in a team.
 Tyrix#6647: your name and this request seem sus
 Lawn#1538: ‘Journey’ springs to mind as exemplary in this category
 BadPiggy#5202: Doesn't really matter tbh kek
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: I’m more into books than games so i should get into making story based games tbh
 BadPiggy#5202: There are story based games which don't say a single word so yeah, narrative design is still important in a lot of ways kek
 theChief#0001: For sure! I just think it's a little spicy to say anything "isn't part of game dev" because you can always find a place for it. I don't often make story-based games because I suck at that sort of thing, but writing is absolutely part of game dev!
 JuliusCube#8501: i mean for getting art that is
stack overflow is still fine in my books because im not taking anything artisticly valuable from people
 JuliusCube#8501: I like making everything myself in game jams, so for me team finder and the internet are no-gos
 BadPiggy#5202: Guess I'm already raising the white flag then lol
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: oh absolutely i'm endlessly inspired by people like toby fox who enhance their game tenfold with their musical skills
 theChief#0001: No
 theChief#0001: Wait
 theChief#0001: Like you don't want twangy bluegrass in a sci fi game
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: oh yea the composer is great at that
 Lawn#1538: Sound makes or a breaks a game imo.
 theChief#0001: Good sound people use the art to influence the direction of the music 😉
 BadPiggy#5202: Making music and SFX is my kryptonite
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: i’m the artist so I’m the least involved with audio
 redve#6507: I've never created a game with sound 💀
 Lawn#1538: There’s plenty of stuff out there, Bandcamp and Soundcloud are ripe with amazing talent. Just get permissions from the artists. Also, team finder. But use the former if you can’t make it yourself or get an artist.
 theChief#0001: Yep! You won't be able to upload a new build, but everything else is fine
 theChief#0001: The best games use sound _really_ well
 Takir#4505: After submition deadline may we change the itch page if we fo not update the game
 GodOfPro#7302: the jam starts 9:30 so i will sleep 1/3 of the jam lol
 theChief#0001: Audio can _really_ improve a game - especially if there are some synced elements of gameplay. E.g. in my game "neon barrage", explosions always happen on beat. Stuff like that makes everything feel so much better
 JuliusCube#8501: the best parts of my favorite games basically need audio to function
if any of you guys have played Outer Wilds you'll know how well that game incorporates music into its game design
thats sorta the stuff I want to do well when making the game, the bad part is that i just have no idea how to make good music or audio.
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: just for mostly older games
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: oh don’t get me wrong, i love game OSTs
 theChief#0001: Nope ☺️
 Äml#2258: yeah same but on the other side I always see reviews of games praising their awesome ost and sound effects
 GodOfPro#7302: do you need to put the game in github for the jam ?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i dont see audio, aside from implementing audio sources and stuff, as part of game dev tbh. it's like part of making a game but to me gamedev is more like about the actual code and systems that make up the game physically
 Äml#2258: right? especially if you have to worry about art and code aswell
 MaryStrawberry#4672: the hard part is composing stuff
you can get away with a sfx generator
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: I play most games with audio off so I’m definitely not qualified to make it
 Bronsolo#4491: not for me. 😉
But yeah... it's legit a difficult thing to get into.
 Äml#2258: lmao
 Äml#2258: fr audio probably hardest part of development
 Bronsolo#4491: oh awesome! I didn't see that. I'll copy/paste this message over there.
 theChief#0001:  is the best place to find teammates! I'm sure there are loads of people looking for audio people 😁
 Bronsolo#4491: also did some monster sounds for Bethesda but idk if they ended up being used.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: hello!
 Bronsolo#4491: howdy, gang! I'm new here.
I made the medkit sfx for SCP Secret lab and the Micro HID for the same game.
I also compose music. 
I want to join a few developer projects in the next game jam for fun. 🙂
 Äml#2258: yo someone still looking for a team?
 JuliusCube#8501: ass...tronaut
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: dont talk about forks i'll think about my OS project and start crying
 M_Raven#4076: screw
 MaryStrawberry#4672: fudge
 JuliusCube#8501: fork
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: @ Mods kill this fool.
 M_Raven#4076: heck
 GodOfPro#7302: unfortunately i have no code i can snag from my projects because i got no other projects lol
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: eh i get that i wasn't either when i got here for the first time
 theChief#0001: Z, it's got arms and a floating head and is a little more upright ☺️ porygon 2 is a boring round duck who's only use is boring stall tactics 
 redve#6507: Ok, i wasn't entirely sure
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: you can fuckin swear, just don't be mean or call people slurs. just dont be a dick, basically
 redve#6507: I paid for entire cpu, SO I WILL USE ENTIRE [censored] CPU
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: porygon z. went under that bridge day one!
 wren#0640: gdscripts not that hard to get the hang of imo
 JuliusCube#8501: weird question, but is that a porygon z or a porygon 2 in your profile picture
i cant tell because i have no idea what the differences between them are.
 Ahat#0842: gonna try not to use it
 wren#0640: ive never tried godots visual scripting
 Deceleris#2307: Yeah clearly that's the borest thing ever, even if the first time is like... OMG THIS IMAGE IS FADING GOD I'M MAKING TRIPLE A NOW
 BadPiggy#5202: The chief got a fanbase kek
 theChief#0001: Ooo you know my stuff? 😁 That makes me happy!
 Ahat#0842: godot can code with blocks, but i kinda hate them
 HerrCron#5856: Apparently, we're using UE5 for this jam.
May god have mercy on our souls.
 BadPiggy#5202: My computer is dying on me again .......
God damn it.
No jam for me if this continues ig
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: WAIT YOU ARE WAYFRAYER?????
 JJfriends#3686: itchy io
 JuliusCube#8501: use godot, Its good
or just use unity its your choice.
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: hey question: what is your itch.io link to page?
thechief.itch.io?
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: Yeah, similar here: I don't want to faff with art or visual design, so I'm almost certainly going text-based.
I've decided on my tech stack, but anything more than that is waaaay to specific to 'prepping to build a game regardless of the theme', given the constraints I've settled on up to this point
 Ahat#0842: might use godot or unity now
 theChief#0001: I've made so many games now that I've just got a huge library of code for pretty much anything 😂 I don't tend to join jams if I can't use it at all, because like you said - I don't want to be doing everything again 😂
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: i'm heading out, take care everyone!
 redve#6507: I have 24 hours, to learn how to port c++ to webassembly 💀
 Ahat#0842: i was thinking of using gamemaker, but i cant export to itch unless i have a paid version, its so stupid
 BadPiggy#5202: Nothing wrong with prepping your own engine before the jam
 Deceleris#2307: Yeah go ahead, collisions is not part of the creativity process, as long it's not a specific and designed feature
 HerrCron#5856: A game/jam framework strikes me as being very much being ok. It's not a game and I don't want to have to write a manager for going between levels *again*
 Ahat#0842: hello
 redve#6507: Also i ask is it fair, not is it againt the rules
 JuliusCube#8501: as long as youre not making the game itself, do whatever
 redve#6507: Ok, now i am struggling a bit. If i am creating game from scratch with SDL2, is it fair to create some basic things like 2d rectangles collision resolving before the jam starts, as i am sure i will do something 2d ( i cannot do anything 3d )?
It is creating a code for a jam before it starts, but from the other hand, people which use ready engine will have it before the jam starts.
The simple answer is "just use unity" but i cannot learn it in 24 hours
 JuliusCube#8501: this is what I usually do as well.
 Deceleris#2307: I have personnaly a "Jam Template" project with only plungins and scripts extensions that I always use in any kind of project :3
That avoid me the boring stuff like writing a code to fade an image 
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: jam ranks ever
1st jam: 160-something/300
2nd jam: 7/8
3rd jam: 6/12
not good but not bad
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: True true.
 theChief#0001: I'm probably going to make a top down shooter, and it'll probably be something along the lines of a roguelike - but that's a broad "I like those things" kind of deal 😂 I'm not writing any code, I'm not making any art, I'm not designing a game, because if the theme is something that doesn't fit I'll do something else
 JuliusCube#8501: I would say there is some difference between "making generic scripts for the jam" and "starting developing a game before a jam"
if you start making generic scripts for basically every genre of game before the jam starts, I'd say that wouldnt be against the rules of the jam because you havent locked yourself into "im making a 3d parkour game where..." or "im making a 2d puzzle game where..." or something similar
when you start making assets that can only be used for a specific game, that is when you cross the line of being against the rules of the jam.
 Lawn#1538: The ambiguity and challenge of limitation are literally the whole point.
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: This is about how you set up your codebase, not any game functionality. If you're working solo and not publicising your codebase, you don't need to worry about this
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: well i mean yeah, but you're not building the game itself, like how i know i probably wont make a 3d game
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Well, I would make a story game regardless, since it's the only thing I can do. So in my case it's normal XD
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: spiderman pointing picture
 redve#6507: Ok, now it's clear. Thank you
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: you can, actually. people can make a game and in the preceeding time (the jam was announced a month ago) and just tweak it so that it fits the theme, even barely
 theChief#0001: Some people say "I'm making a puzzle game regardless, and I'll just shoehorn the theme in when we know what it is" 😂
 Redline#7370: then that's fine, I'm doing it like that too
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: but I put credits in game
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I just don't get why people are asking (sometimes) these specific questions. Isn't it just like, use some common sense, don't try to create a loophole for a gamejam. We just trying to have fun here.
 Redline#7370: credits? I think
 redve#6507: But this rule is written for a reason
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: what that means
Create a READ-ME with license info
 redve#6507: I mean, i get the concept, but if i don't know theme, i cannot derive concept of game, and start making important things earlier, so i don't think is there anything i can prepare before the jam starts
 Lawn#1538: Then make a shoot to move game.
 Redline#7370: hmm nvm then
 theChief#0001: Check the pins 😉 there's a post from mark explaining
 Redline#7370: we need that pinned clearly
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: I made my avatar and gamedev art not game art
 HerrCron#5856: I think as the rules, as written, can feel  bit fuzzy, so a rule of thumb is - if it feels like cheating, then it probably is.
If you have an existing controller in unity for 2D platforming, you could reuse that
if you went home tonight and made a 2D controller in unity because you know you're gonna make a 2D platformer no matter what the theme is.... that's a paddlin'
 theChief#0001: The rule is essentially "don't start making a specific game before the jam starts". That includes writing code or making art.
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: why hello! Wacha doin'
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: hello!
 Hannes#5054: Hi! :D
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: then look at my avatar. It's done
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i exagerated for the sake of the comedy, but i think this is probably fine. the idea is "you shouldn't write premade code yourself that will go in the end product of the game before the actual jam starts because it's outside the spirit of the competition"
 redve#6507: Rollercoaster tycoon vibes
 HerrCron#5856: Oh god, not ASM, not again....
 wren#0640: i mean it wasnt written specifically for the jam its free reign so long as you have the right to use it
 jonahhw#9743: If you don't write it from scratch in assembly, you're instantly disqualified
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: lmao
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: mark is not, in fact, going to dock you points for using the cos function from math.h
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: obviously premade libraries like a math library are fine
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: anything you use in the 48 hours is fine. You can't write code together ready to use it when the jam starts
 Mark Brown#6982: Why is it in the rules? Because "This is a race to make a game, and everyone starts running when the jam begins! As such, we expect you to make the vast majority of the game during this time. "
 redve#6507: I've read it, but still i don't entirely get it, at least if you mean first part of question
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Hope it does aswell.
 birdstone#3073: very helpful and non-corrupt moderators and helpers
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: check the pins, mark speaks about it himself
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I like all of them in the short period I got to know them.
 birdstone#3073: i hope it goes well
 redve#6507: ```
But we ask that you don’t write code specifically for this jam, ahead of time.
```
I am interested why is it in rules? And will it be judged if i will use thing like opengl math library, which is afaik on MiT license?
 wren#0640: ive never really seen a renpy game in a jam outside of specialised vn jams
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: It was, I was looking for a thing to use and stumbled on it on accident and man it works lovely for what I want, mainly having the player's choices mean something isn't that hard. (and I can go wild with the decision trees lol)
 Lawn#1538: Keep your pants on. I’m just a senior citizen quoting old movies 🍿
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: very powerful tool for very specialized stuff
 birdstone#3073: ~~theChief because he was nice enough to try my game from last year and give me some feedback~~
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: renpy is a strong framework, falls in the same category as rpg maker for me
 birdstone#3073: ooo renpy, i think doki doki literature club was made with that? all i know it's a visual novel python engine
 Peshoddd#9446: Who is your favourite mod helper?
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I can't wait for me to start getting it coded with renpy. We got a lot of story writing to still do but we both love doing it. Very excited to work on it and show it to our friends (they are awesome in supporting us!)
 birdstone#3073: WOOOOO now i can do very rude things without dealing with guilt afterwards
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: keep countdowns to the   channel please
 Peshoddd#9446: someone understands
 birdstone#3073: it's always fun to make something together
 Peshoddd#9446: Yes.
 Lawn#1538: That is when the world will end.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: that sure is the time missing to the jam starting
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Yea me and a friend always wanted to make a game (he has awesome ideas and artskills) and so we decided to make a story game and he finally got his drawing tablet working again. :D
 Peshoddd#9446: 1 day   22 hours   35 minutes   9seconds
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: if you play downloaded jam games you've long got over clicking 'run this anyway' lol
 birdstone#3073: ooo that sounds fun
 redve#6507: Damm it. If i will try crosscompile it, the ~~hecking~~ loved windows defender gonna block it, like it always did with my programs which i tried to crosscompile
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: that's the reality the rules are representing
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: This is what i'm trying to do with my storygame.
 birdstone#3073: you should feel like you're part of the story rather than spectating it
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: mark plays all the games on his windows game capture pc. it has to run on that, without him having to download anything else because he doesn't want to
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: is this a bad linux joke?
I like it
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: It's like trying to make your choices matter, mabye have a couple minigames (tho optional) for the player to not have the feeling like you just have to press space for an lifetime.
 redve#6507: I somehow missed that point
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i mean, it's pretty clear in the rules? you could also just make it a webgl or html5 or web game
 redve#6507: It's dark in my room, but i really had to remove windows
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: or birdin'rock
 birdstone#3073: i do somewhat enjoy story games and more specifically ones that feel like the game should serve to enhance the story and not like i'm reading through a digital novel
 redve#6507: WHAT?! IT HAS TO RUN ON WINDOWS?!
Screw it, it's not worth to start
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: Now how in the world do I make a rockin'bird
 jonahhw#9743: On the subject of Unity's merger with ironSource, I've been reading their blog post and their goal seems to be deeply integrating monetization/ads into games.
> What if [the game development] process was no longer "first create; then monetize?”  What if creators had an engine for live games that by default enabled them to gain early indicators of success for their games […]
I think this is just another symptom of Unity's slow decline, and it's probably time for 2d devs to jump ship to Godot and 3d devs to choose between Godot and Unreal.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: hmm, you do know that the game has to run either on web or on windows to be accepted as an entry, right?
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: then it is a thing!!!!
RockBirdStudio!!!!
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Heck yes *vibes* my friend, who is doing the art for our game, just messaged me saying his cable arrived and he can use his drawing tablet again. I'm so freaking happy rn
 redve#6507: I am gonna make game exclusively for google fuchsia and reactOs
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: Also it's only me that hates story games but likes pokemon?
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: I have made 0 puzzle games overal
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: that's why people won't download games and need web builds
 iceberglettuce#4394: I have only made a non-puzzle game for a jam once
 Peshoddd#9446: and mine is to make something that won't harm your computer (comp. virus)
 birdstone#3073: my discord username is birdstone and i approve of this
 Redline#7370: my challenge is actually streaming for 13 hours twice
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: Thought of a name!!!
RockBird Studios
With a bird holding a guitar
 iceberglettuce#4394: Yea puzzle games always seem to dominate short jams cause they’re faster to make and you can show off how smart you are by coming up with a cool mechanic
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: my challenge is to now make a platformer or something like square shooter (game I made)
 birdstone#3073: good and creative puzzle design is something i need to work on
 iceberglettuce#4394: my challenge for myself this time is to make anything other than a puzzle game
 birdstone#3073: it is indeed, and many impatient children have stepped into these lands
 Peter#0007: if it's taking you less than 15 seconds to compose your reply it's probably not very worthwhile for everybody
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: on monday, I was on a robotic-course-thing
we made a sumo lego bot
I programmed it so it will never go out of the sumo's black line and it will also spin to find where it's opponent is, then attack the opponent
when it was fight time, our robot saw the opponent, rushed forward, saw the black line, moved backwards, spinned and relocated it's opponent.
then it dashed and falled without thinking of the black line
it was the first battle
we lost
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i suppose that school time is over in america-land or something
 birdstone#3073: it's just a 15 second cooldown i don't get why that's a big deal
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: It is totally necessary in bigger servers lmao
 birdstone#3073: oh i think i saw that too
 Peshoddd#9446: i thinked 5k are alive in this server
 Redline#7370: I always say go-dot, bc hungary moment
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: fondly remembering the time someone today tried to say that the slow mode wasn't that necessary
 jonahhw#9743: Yeah, that's an even better way of putting it from what I understand
 birdstone#3073: ahhhh i see
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: god-oh
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: If only I could...
 jonahhw#9743: The second one, it's French
 SlingingPlant145#5532: Yeah. In that case though, what was crazy was that it just magically stopped working. Normally, I'll discover some bug that I just didn't notice the previous night, but it just stopped working period last year until I rewrote the whole script. :/
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I will. I'm glad I can do something even with my mental health being rockbottom.
 jonahhw#9743: Would recommend, it's awesome
 birdstone#3073: is it pronounced "go-dot" or "go-dough"?
 Peter#0007: if you're waiting for them to show up and teach you you'll be waiting a while
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: I need to learn how unity works now I know 10% of it
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: I have a solution
Scare them away
 iceberglettuce#4394: I need to learn godot 😭
 birdstone#3073: haha seems like you'll be having a fun weekend
 Peshoddd#9446: Have you been attacked by virus
 iceberglettuce#4394: yea, they recently moved to a subscription model for exporting to different things
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: wot
what happened
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Well luckily for me I'm playtesting so i'll be fine. Hope to sleep a bit better to be awake when people need me to playtest.
 jonahhw#9743: ~~Is this some sort of Gamemaker joke I'm too Godot to understand?~~
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: put copyright
siteSamAlexandrosused
 Peter#0007: html export license? that a game maker thing?
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: it is called board games
 birdstone#3073: thanks i'm stealing that
 iceberglettuce#4394: I'm probably gonna end up paying for the html export license just for this jam cause wayyy more people will give you ratings if you can play in browser
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: I once heard this joke:
-have a nice weekend!
-I hope your code works the same on monday as it did today
 birdstone#3073: unlucky, hopefully those'll go away soon and not interrupt your performance during the jam
 Peter#0007: ah, things no game dev has ever wanted to implement. yay. unity corp going downhill as always
 Peshoddd#9446: i am actually not coding games
 jonahhw#9743: Apparently they "develop technologies for app monetization and distribution", which doesn't explain much but doesn't sound good
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: the one and only godot
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Haven't slept well the last couple of nights, nightmares yay... So not doing that great.
 Hobusu#5033: Because by default replies ping the person you're replying to, unless you specifically disable that (like I've just done)
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: wot
I don't care I'm not gonna update it
 birdstone#3073: didn't get any sleep last night because of the heat but other than that not bad, hbu
 SlingingPlant145#5532: No joke, that actually happened to me last year when I was working on a simple door script. Everything worked fine on Friday, I woke up Saturday morning and the door was spinning at the speed of light. It took something like 2-3 hours just to fix a bug that didn't exist the previous night.
 redve#6507: Why?
 Peter#0007: i still don't know what they do, anyone know?
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: hru today Daniel?
 redve#6507: I will write my game for linux only, i hope all 3 people which will play it will like it
 jonahhw#9743: I heard Unity's merging with IronSource
 iceberglettuce#4394: GameMaker gang rise up
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: 🥽 ????????
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: it is my first year in gamedev and I use unity engine because my teacher said it's good and now I learnt it myself
 birdstone#3073: welcome back emi
 TheGameShePlays#7762: Unity (that one 2020 build I refuse to give up because I liked it best 😂)
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Hello everyone!
 addiment#3628: try getting UE4 to work on linux with intel integrated 💀
 redve#6507: But it's bloatware, and i will get over 800 packages i have ;_;
 jonahhw#9743: Godot, assuming I actually participate
 Peshoddd#9446: none just type the code and play it
 Selviam#7268: Unity! Because it’s all I know
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I read step 4 as "goggles" and was very confused
 birdstone#3073: ~~notepad++~~ unity
 Peter#0007: unity 2022.1 alpha because its the only build that runs decent frames on a m1 macbook's external monitor 🙂
 redve#6507: Everything from scratch, i am kind of masochist
 birdstone#3073: ***it just works***
 Hobusu#5033: On a different topic, what game engines are you all using this year?
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: Let me cover a gamedev's (mostly programmer's) day
step one: open engine
step two: everything lost must start from scratch
step three: starts writing code
step four: googles
Step five: copy-pastes after searching for an hour
step six: all working surprisingly good
step seven: sleep
the other day: *1000 errors from same code*
 birdstone#3073: it's mostly annoying for mods
 Hobusu#5033: The reason you were muted was because you were asked not to do something and your response was to say no, in a way that was deliberately as annoying for me to read as possible
 Selviam#7268: Ohhh
 birdstone#3073: spoiler bubbles, where there's a bunch of characters marked as spoilers and you click to reveal each one
 Peshoddd#9446: k
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: take the advice my dude
 Selviam#7268: What do bubbles mean? Like a picture of bubbles?
 Peshoddd#9446: it wasn't my point of that just i was lazy to move from alt to normal
 Selviam#7268: For my one person company name I’ll probably go with the one I made in 4th grade Scratch Paper Ink
 Peter#0007: common sense > rules lawyering
 birdstone#3073: well i mean it's more just use your common sense
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: yeah i'm going to take a guess that trying to circumvent mutes and bans isnt the wisest thing to do
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: its not smart to get muted as an alt then come back and talk about how you were on an alt that was muted, just a heads up
 birdstone#3073: **it just works**
 Peshoddd#9446: No one typed in the rules that bubbles will get you muted
 redve#6507: 3 reddit posts, every solution in google, and all i got is a stroke
 birdstone#3073: that isn't good lmao
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: I know somebody named Wayfrayer Studios and it's a nice one
 Peshoddd#9446: i think i got muted in 5-10 mins
 Pyronite#0267: m.
 SlingingPlant145#5532: Too true
 redve#6507: I am struggling to make hitman blood money work on recent proton for 2 days.
I get an error "Required Vulkan extension VK_KHR_surface not supported"
plot twist, I HAVE THIS DAMN EXTENSION
 Redline#7370: mine's Nitro-Gen Studios but that's like really long lol, try to think of something simple and short unlike mine
 Peter#0007: thanks, it's a pleasure to be here tonight
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: guys how should I name my 1-man-game studio (insert lol here)
I was called TacoSauceDev
But it's not good to like, release games...
 birdstone#3073: welcome to the internet
 Peter#0007: i didn't think it was possible to get muted this early but so far several people have proven me wrong
 Peshoddd#9446: normal reasons
 addiment#3628: that's why linux powers the world and nobody knows about it. if they did, the world wouldn't work
 jonahhw#9743: Schrödinger's bugs
 Peshoddd#9446: cuz i was lazy to close itch app and go to firefox
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: oh really :le-gasp:
 redve#6507: Linux has a magic ability to break, when anybody see, and work perfecly fine when you cannot show it
 birdstone#3073: ?? why do you need an alt on this server
 Peshoddd#9446: so i was on my alt
 redve#6507: Sometimes word or two
 addiment#3628: linux do what windon't
 redve#6507: It does, but directx don't
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: oh really
here->())
 birdstone#3073: lol dw it happened a few months back so i'm all good now, ty for the concern
 addiment#3628: video call me and cry about it (that is, if your graphics, audio, and webcam drivers function 🤘🤘)
 redve#6507: Ferb has never said "yes, yes i am"
 JohnLivingston#4642: Sorry to hear that Daniel! Hope you’re doing okay!
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: (phineas AND ferb or only...)
 birdstone#3073: i had to reread this a few times
 redve#6507: Yes, yes i am (insert phineas here)
 birdstone#3073: lol i don't either that was a rare occurrence for me
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: wait so you're an adult? Oh no.
 redve#6507: *angry opensource whispers*
 addiment#3628: I get no maidens 😔
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: oh hey mark
why you just spawn and jumpscare people?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: not the best joke to make tbh
 redve#6507: I need to choose between coding and breeding, unfortunetely it's hard to do both on the same time
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: this is sad and good at the same freakin time
 Mark Brown#6982: Blaziken! Use [Murder]!
 Tapu#9161: I have a whole channel of bubble wrap spoilers in my server, kinda fun to pop em all
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: oh yeah
 unityAccount#7810: Have there been any mutes/bans this year so far?
 addiment#3628: I just realized, you use SDL2 and have a tux profile picture. it all makes sense now
 Hobusu#5033: Making it into bubble-wrap is certainly one way to get yourself timed out
 redve#6507: My girl will come to me this friday.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: it's an interestingly foolish game to play with a mod like that
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: Sorry, but I hope you don't get kicked or something
 Peshoddd#2982: Ok fine
 birdstone#3073: i can sense impending doom
 Hobusu#5033: Yeah, the decision was made to not allow threads because it would split conversation into so many different places we would be unable to keep track of it all
 Peshoddd#2982: Well ||s||||o||||r||||r||||y|||| ||||b||||u||||t||||,|||| ||||n||||o||
 birdstone#3073: i don't think we needle that trouble
 birdstone#3073: plus with so many people here there'd be soo many threads at once
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: oh really? Sorry. We were just RUSH EEEEEEing
 addiment#3628: ig, they are *mods* after all
 birdstone#3073: but the mods and mod helpers would have to go in and check every single one
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: oh join. read everything in  and you will be fine
 addiment#3628: no way, it would be more organized
 DrNukeLear#2414: My team is 5 people who have never met before. Seems to be going ok.
 Hobusu#5033: Hey,  and , can you not chain spoiler tags like that? Mods have to check every single one to make sure there isn't any attempt to sneak stuff in that's against the rules
 birdstone#3073: that would be super chaotic
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: ~~don't~~check pins?
 addiment#3628: HEY MODS can we have threads
 Peshoddd#2982: no, Jmtk - Junior Minecraft Tank KId
 addiment#3628: I wish we had threads lol
 Reemus#7953: Any pointers on how to use team finder if I want to JOIN a team?
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: non patrons online: 5133
31
27
28
crap
 addiment#3628: That shouldn't be a problem
 birdstone#3073: there's like two separate conversations going on at once lmao
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: ||GMTK||
 addiment#3628: Windows and linux use different include statements though, so you should use this:
```cpp
#ifdef _WIN32
#include 
#else
#include 
#endif
```
 redve#6507: Yeah, test if it works
 Peshoddd#2982: ||Rush JMTK22||
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: Online patrons: 1100 (I will scroll all the way down till I find non-patrons)
 Catfish#2063: Can't I just specify windows to g++
 Catfish#2063: I can ask a friend but to compile the code they would need to download the libraries too
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: ||rush I (I don't have time I have to rush)||
 Peshoddd#2982: Ok Now
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: oh pancakes
 Peshoddd#2982: ||Rush GD-Greek Debt||
 addiment#3628:  The actual code you write with SDL is totally cross-platform, but you need to compile it for each platform individually
 unityAccount#7810: Well, this ended up being my main account😅
 Catfish#2063: But in code blocks I setted the target platforms to all 3
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: ||rush G - Greece (boom)||
 neilmakesgames#0452: You could use emscripten to make a web version of your SDL 2 game, right?
 birdstone#3073: hahahahaha
 Peshoddd#2982: ||POV: 1  year later: Rush B-Berlin||
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: Alt Accounts are mostly banned from servrers
 redve#6507: When i wanted run linux code on windows, i set up entire compiler on windows and recompiled it there. You can experiment with mingw compiler, but thats a rouletter if it will work
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: A good idea may be putting my friend to make the art hehe if he can
 birdstone#3073: whats up
 addiment#3628: C++ is platform specific
 Catfish#2063: Waaat, what if I want it to work on windows
 redve#6507: You can try cross compile...
and get blocked by windows defender because windows defender
 redve#6507: If you compile it on linux, it probably won't work on windows and osx
the same situation for other systems
 birdstone#3073: i'm teaming up with friends i've known for a long long time since i'm really familiar with their skills and how they work
for strangers i kind of avoid lol i'd need a few months to get familiar with working with them
 Catfish#2063: Lol btw thanks 😊😊
 Peshoddd#2982: ||E||
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: I mean how in the world do teaming up with random people online work?
 Peshoddd#2982: `E`
 Catfish#2063: I just need help when u guys compile sdl2 code does it work on all pcs or do they need to install the libraries too?   
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: guys is it a good idea to team up?
 Peshoddd#2982: Pro Tip: Don't be noob!
 Lawn#1538: ~~You’re going to have to either tag them or reply, your conversation will get lost in this chat real easy.~~ or trust in the suspiciously named unityAccount
 unityAccount#7810: The dlls should be enough afaik
 Catfish#2063: I just need help when u guys compile sdl2 code does it work on all pcs or do they need to install the libraries too?
 Lawn#1538: They must ascend.
 Catfish#2063: Back
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Great writing. Amazing acting.
 Lawn#1538: Gory at times but top tier entertainment.
 Peshoddd#2982: i am in discord from the itch.io app
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: But, what about all of the non-oranges?
 redve#6507: || spoiler ||
 JJfriends#3686: is it good?
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: This last season was good.
 Lawn#1538: Head to  there was a pretty lengthy conversation about it there the other day.
 Peshoddd#2982: What the heckin' is this?
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Yoooo. Anyone watch The Boys?
 Peshoddd#2982: bois
 redve#6507: Did you ask just for asking, or you need some help?
 CookiesRiot#2732: A game that you pay somebody else to play for you.
 Shimp#0064: Persona 5
 redve#6507: A game that plays itself
*displays stream from twitch, or youtube video with gameplay*
 Peshoddd#2982: uhhh yes
 birdstone#3073: didn't sam hogan basically make that?
 addiment#3628: if you want a memory-safe entity management system, HMU
 CookiesRiot#2732: A game that plays itself would've been a hilarious one for 2020's Out Of Control theme.
 Peshoddd#2982: sup
 addiment#3628: I just know how to use it pretty well
 Lawn#1538: Oh. My bad. I saw you mention it.
 redve#6507: Me a bit
 addiment#3628: sorry to disappoint but I am NOT using SDL during this jam
 Dokkae#6949: Btw why does the team-finder ignore newlines (formatting)?
 Lawn#1538: I found you a friend.
 redve#6507: I got pinged
 addiment#3628: i got pinged
 Lawn#1538: There are a couple of people here using sdl2, , , and 
And one using sdl12
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: did i miss anything?
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: We saw that, Mark. Lmao.
 birdstone#3073: thank you mark very cool
 Catfish#2063: Does anyone use sdl2
 Catfish#2063: Hi
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: 
 Lawn#1538: Whisk Grav away too 
 Developer Grav#4479: sure, let's do it
 Lawn#1538:  you may also want to join in if this is affecting you
 Dokkae#6949: ~~yeah~~ lets use dm
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: That _shouldn't_ be a concern, but it's worth checking - mind if we pick this up in DMs to declutter the channel?
 Dokkae#6949: But maybe it got blocked by my ad blocker
 Dokkae#6949: GMTK discord bot ?
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: Uh oh - when you submit the post, what message do you see in the pop-up?
 RedTeapot#1960: They don't replace sanity, quite the opposite in fact
 Reemus#7953: Include NFTs
 Dokkae#6949: Because the post doesn't show up
 Dokkae#6949: On the site
 Lawn#1538: What do you mean by accepted? Like on the site or by someone else?
 Developer Grav#4479: By the way, question for the mods. How long does it take for the teamfinder post to get accepted?
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Sanity is not included.
 RedTeapot#1960: Because oxygen is not included
 RedTeapot#1960: There was goo
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Was there oxygen in that atmosphere?
 RedTeapot#1960: Played it quite a while ago. Besides the puzzles, liked the atmosphere it had
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: oh god i was watching adam's video on unsolvable problems and got re minded of world of goo. i spent so many hours on this as a kid
 Developer Grav#4479: Beforing you're laying in your self-dug grave
 birdstone#3073: i remember someone ported doom to twitter lmao
 Redline#7370: twitch chat controls the game
 Kep#8511: therefore just blow into the microphone like in super mario 3d world (to move the platforms?)
 Lawn#1538: You could use live data from something like tides, the stock market, tweets, etc.
 Dokkae#6949: You can...
For 30 seconds
 Developer Grav#4479: And you can't play games at midnight screaming into your microphone
 StormyMay#4100: No it was a smaller platformer with actual voice input mechnics
 Developer Grav#4479: I would already know how frustrated I would be just voice controlling video games
 Dokkae#6949: Just dance?
 BlenderStudent#4251: BRILLIANT GENIUS
 birdstone#3073: i can't even move individual toes except for the first ones
 StormyMay#4100: Whats the game that makes you sing to move
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: feet
 Redline#7370: voice, motion tracking
 Dokkae#6949: vr?
 birdstone#3073: WHAT
 Lawn#1538: Kinect maybe? Bob your head to move.
 BlenderStudent#4251: a game that PLAYS ITSELF
 birdstone#3073: feet
 Dokkae#6949: Or make his teammates work for him some extra hours 💀
 Developer Grav#4479: But for real. What is the best way to play a game without hands...
 BlenderStudent#4251: in that case use something like gamemaker studio to make your game
 Lawn#1538: iirc one of the Zelda games explored mic input in one of their puzzles.
 Developer Grav#4479: and frustrating
 BlenderStudent#4251: 😂
 Dokkae#6949: Just tell people that you can win alot of money so you want to participate
 Developer Grav#4479: "Move to the right... MOVE to the RIGHT... MOVE TO THE RIGHT!!!"
 dardasaba#9759: Oof
I also won't be home Friday evening  and will only get home late (so I'll head straight to bed)
Meaning I'll miss the first 12+ hours of the jam :(
 Lawn#1538: This is the way. Motion controls could work.
 Developer Grav#4479: I'll have 7 hours to finish my game.
 Dokkae#6949: Oh no
 RedTeapot#1960: Still more than a day to go
 BlenderStudent#4251: good luck
 Developer Grav#4479: I'm not home for friday and half of saturday 💀
 Reemus#7953: 2 days
 BlenderStudent#4251: lol (confused at the last min) no offense
 RedTeapot#1960: 48 hours
 dardasaba#9759: No, 2 days (48 hours jam)
 Developer Grav#4479: Wait but the game jam is a week right?
 dardasaba#9759: Ah yes, an open ended theme that can be interpreted in many different ways xD
 BlenderStudent#4251: imagine time travel
 Lawn#1538: No one wants to buy your crypto or NFTs in this space.
 Lawn#1538: Bro
 Reemus#7953: But an ex-colleague of mine is investigating crypto crimes, so he asked me for help.
 Developer Grav#4479: Just voice recognition
I am totally not making money off an NFT MMO development
 Lawn#1538: You guys can do better than that surely.
 Developer Grav#4479: Make a game without keybinds
 Reemus#7953: Yeah I totally hate it as well
 birdstone#3073: Make a game without making a game
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: make a game without interaction
 Reemus#7953: Sadge.
 Lawn#1538: Make a game without buttons.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: fuckin uhhhhhhhhh dunno. press button to win
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Zelda
 BlenderStudent#4251: Guys What do you think the game jam theme will be?
 Lawn#1538: Tangent, but these Links are top tier:
 Lawn#1538: She has done no wrong, yet.
 Space_Farmer#9620: looks like GM TIK
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Ban ana.
 Lawn#1538: On this note, I am yet to bring out the banana hammer. Jam day might be my time.
 Scolon#4218: Yes
 JuliusCube#8501: 48 hours
 Ghost.#0310: gmtk
 ConstantDerivative#6302: 2 days before the jam
 Lawn#1538: Good game. 10/5 bananas 🍌
 Hobusu#5033: I recommend playing it! *After* the Jam, if it hooks you it'll hook you *hard*
 Lawn#1538: There’s a mower joke opp missed too.
 Hobusu#5033: (In case it wasn't obvious, that was a Slay the Spire joke)
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Lawn, the Wrather
 Hobusu#5033: ~~don't make Lawn go into Wrath Stance~~
 Lawn#1538: Just be cool. That’s all I ask.
 RedTeapot#1960: That's my default setting for all servers hehe
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Lawn, The Watcher.
 randall#2501: Notifications> "@ only"
 Hobusu#5033: That's true, I actually can wait
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Sounds like you can indeed wait.
 Hobusu#5033: Yeah, I ""can't wait"" either
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Game Jam Conspiracy Mk II.
 RedTeapot#1960: What?
 randall#2501: well at least itd be an excuse to make a shit game
 AEIOU#0652: And the silence while jam ongoing
 Scolon#4218: Can't wait to see this channel explode when the theme is announced
 randall#2501: 🔥
 MaryStrawberry#4672: yo red teapot, game jam conspiracy electric boogaloo?
 RedTeapot#1960: More like ban coin
 MaryStrawberry#4672: based
 Murten#0001: Who would like to buy my byteCoin?
 R2D2Vader#0693: 😎
 Peter#0007: brutal but deserved
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: AHA! THE LEGENDARY MARK BROWN BURNS THE PATRONS AND MODS WERE TALKING ABOUT
 Fraserfatt#1021: 😂
 Mark Brown#6982: Because we’re actually cool 😎
 Mark Brown#6982: You can, but, bruh, I doubt you’re gonna find anyone too interested in crypto here
 Reemus#7953: Hey guys can I ask unrelated questions here? I need some crypto help,
does anyone know about CFT trading?
 Murten#0001: Jam starts: 
 MistTree#0001: 48 hours left!
 Scolon#4218: Itch.io should already show it in your timezone
 Sonicpixelation#1068: 1pm
 birdstone#3073: the pressure is building
 Kyikii#6354: Anyone know when the jam will be in est time?
 Scolon#4218: At the very least make sure you can compile and play something
Don't want to deal with submission issues during the jam and lose precious development time
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: knowing how to work with vectors is so useful in gamedev
 neilmakesgames#0452: found it: 3,313 entrants in 2018
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: the one prep i'm missing is going over the entire vector2 docs in godot
 Space_Farmer#9620: i was born for this jam
 Scolon#4218: I think I finished all my preparations
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: just enough time for a practice jam
 Space_Farmer#9620: 2 days
 Lawn#1538: Going off last year, I think embeds worked in the progress pic and stream rooms.
 Space_Farmer#9620: guys i found the game jam Theame
 RedTeapot#1960: I hope they are
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: as far as I know
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: Yeah embeds are enabled there
 Lawn#1538: Gotta pay the bills somehow.
 Space_Farmer#9620: english is not my main language
 Shimp#0064: And post it on itch io
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: Or at least, they will be for the locked ones
 RedTeapot#1960: Ah, I meant, the embeds and whatnot
 Shimp#0064: If i won't be able to make a good game, i will make a slideshow with memes relating to the theme of the jam
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: All channels you can see are open to non-patrons
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: *you're
 Lawn#1538: All gravy baby.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Ah, right. My bad.
 Space_Farmer#9620: Wow your smart
 L3mmy♡#2307: Nah
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: No
 RedTeapot#1960: Will  be only for patrons too?
 Lawn#1538: The rooms will open up for that on the jam day. Be patient.
 JuliusCube#8501: just post a link to it
 Space_Farmer#9620: i got a funny meme and i need to pay to post it lol
 Shimp#0064: I am unsure, but i am sure it was more than 5
 L3mmy♡#2307: a lot, you're welcome neil /j
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I mean... being able to post pics of your game in progress *could* attract more attention. Idk.
 neilmakesgames#0452: i'm crunching some numbers, does anyone know how many participants the jam had in 2018?
 Shimp#0064: Its not a server just for jam
 JuliusCube#8501: because this server is pay to win or something
except it isnt because becoming a patron will not help you win
 RedTeapot#1960: Capitalism yay
 Space_Farmer#9620: oh
 JuliusCube#8501: get patreon?
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: you can be a patron!
 RedTeapot#1960: Become a patron
 Space_Farmer#9620:  sorry for taging is any way that i can post an image on this server?
 JuliusCube#8501: its *very* ~~un~~funny
 Space_Farmer#9620: yea
 JuliusCube#8501: and each of the followers is given one game and has to rate it.
 RedTeapot#1960: Too late
 Space_Farmer#9620: o the boss is typing lol
 Mark Brown#6982: As the person who made that joke I am going to reliably inform you that it’s not actually funny
 Tapu#9161: Best theme ever
 JuliusCube#8501: hopefully i turned off the ping there
 JuliusCube#8501: pants are for losers
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: the theme will be across
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: I can predict it
 Scolon#4218: No one has ever correctly predicted the theme I don't think, so
 wren#0640: i dont see it being based on untitled magnet game bc last years theme is wayyy too close to what a theme related to magnets would be
 MaryStrawberry#4672: ~~what if the theme is related to magnetism so Mark can "borrow" gimmicks and ideas for his game~~
 RocketCow#5210: Reverse jam: Mark makes 15.000 games for his followers.
 Scolon#4218: Easy, just become intentionally ignorant of the games that are out there :D
In all seriousness I do that to some extent and take a lot more inspiration from real life and really *really* random things
 neilmakesgames#0452: "make mark's game for him" 😄
 MaryStrawberry#4672: ok is it magnet related
 RocketCow#5210: clonk clonk clonk
*What a thrill...*
No, wait.
 Samarjan#1383: i dont really think anyone is complaining, i think people are just finding the similarities and grouping them together as people do. its a good way to find new games to play lol
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: hey, they gained you a possible future new patron
 MaryStrawberry#4672: _You're gonna carry that weight._
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: make a strand-type game
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: that last one is something i have gripes on because there is real criticism to make of how many new earthbound inspired game have been made that don't really actually get what made earthbound, like, good
 Scolon#4218: Technically every game genre is "overused"
 wren#0640: there arent even that many! and most of the time theyre good! why are you complaining!
 wren#0640: god i hate that meme so much
 Shimp#0064: I've seen so many memes on that, on par with "another earthbound inspired rpg" meme
 theChief#0001: Really? I don't think I've noticed that myself
 Shimp#0064: It is good, but its so overused, that i notice how people try to avoid playing those sometimes
 Samarjan#1383: omg its bark
 theChief#0001: Tbh roguelikes are a good candidate for jam games anyway - don't have to bother with save state!
 RedTeapot#1960: You (probably) read our dumb jokes so please let us read yours
 Shimp#0064: Oh no, so many rouge likes would be made
 theChief#0001: Yeah this is full DALLE-2 - I've been pleasantly surprised
 unityAccount#7810: *Ugly Sonic*
 wren#0640: i put this into open ai playground
`What is the GMTK 2022 Game Jam theme?`
`The theme for the GMTK 2022 Game Jam is "Endless".`
 RocketCow#5210: What's that subreddit called again that mangles the text on advertisements?
 RedTeapot#1960: Daym Sonic looks kinda good on these
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: oh god sohes looks like he's about to bloody unhinge his jaw and DEVOUR ME
 theChief#0001: It's my favourite text by a LONG way
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: SOOLECS
 Hobusu#5033: True!
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: GAM GUNKOM is my favorite by far
 theChief#0001: That is a key part of the game maker's tool kit
 RedTeapot#1960: I mean, at least it's letters
 RedTeapot#1960: So the theme is Moken GΔK Gamk
 theChief#0001: To be honest I really love the style of the top middle pic
 unityAccount#7810: Love the USB-screwdriver
 Hobusu#5033: For some value of better, yes
 RedTeapot#1960: Oh, it got better at drawing text apparently
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Moken Gak gamk
 Redline#7370: game'nt gam
 unityAccount#7810: Look up GMTK Jam Theme
 Lawn#1538: ~~The Chief used AI to decipher the theme. It is “Thakiingb time”~~
 MaryStrawberry#4672: _I saw you there Mark_ 👀
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: shoot to pants
 MaryStrawberry#4672: sounds about right
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Pants are for losers.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I approve. Remember to practice exporting and uploading to itch
 MaryStrawberry#4672: so, what do you guys think the theme will be?
 Zoro5168#0115: Yo
 BadPiggy#5202: I still find it funny that the origin of this meme is from a child's birthday cake
 unityAccount#7810:
 RedTeapot#1960: And I'm watching some Godot shader videos because I'm procrastinating
 BadPiggy#5202: My workout includes not using my computer much these days in preparation for overworking it during the weekend lol
figured I'd start my gamejam prep warmup exercises early lol
good ol jumpy box always a good one
 Lawn#1538: It’ll depend how rowdy it gets in here.
 Lawn#1538: Need you to bring the fire 🔥
 Lawn#1538: Definitely.
 Lawn#1538: Everyone is waking up or about to finish school/work.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i'd rather it be calm honestly!
 Lawn#1538: It will pick up soon.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: The calm before the storm?
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Jam channels pretty calm today, eh?
 Merus#7019: mod senpai wasn't lying
 Merus#7019: I screenshotted this to come post it in the jam general chat and what do I find
 Triggered#6897: S4 makes the earlier seasons worth it IMO
 wren#0640: it consistently has really strong characters but then the plot falls flat imo
 wren#0640: i have really mixed opinions on it
 BisectedBrioche#6824: I think I've watch the first three episodes of S1, and never got around to the rest
 BisectedBrioche#6824: I haven't seen it yet either.
 TheGerkuman#0091: Oh
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: ~~Yes.~~ No.
 TheGerkuman#0091: Will I be ostracised for admitting that I haven't watched any
 TheGerkuman#0091: I'm confused now
 wren#0640: do we have any evidence of the (spoilers) ||other super power kids|| needing to go to the toilet because if not then it might not be vecna specific
 Stopa#6148: Wait... what were the slimy tubes he always attached himself to for if not for that?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: what are we, on some mtg rule stuff?
 birdstone#3073: thanks i'm gonna become a patron now
 wren#0640: hes still human hes just a Creature as well
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Nah. You only need one person to form a company. Lol.
Source: I have my own company.
 wren#0640: i dont see why not
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: the perfect advertisement
 RedTeapot#1960: Guess that's worth $1/mo kek
 TheGerkuman#0091: Mark Brown there with the hottest takes
 TheGerkuman#0091: My fears were realised. Time to see if theres any spaces left on the team finder
 RedTeapot#1960: Hi
 TheGerkuman#0091: Hello
 RedTeapot#1960: For me 20+ people in a team is already kinda too many. Although there are no hoodies for winners, no reason to worry
 birdstone#3073: you're just forming a company at that point lmao
 DrNukeLear#2414: Limit of 1 hoody per team. Gonna have to share.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I think once teams start hitting the triple digits, mark is gonna implement a team cap. Lol.
 RedTeapot#1960: We might then assemble a giant 1000 person team to get moar free hoodies
 joshe woshe#6343: wow, nobody has said anything for 10 minutes
 Jeker#3389: Regular show for the win <3.
 birdstone#3073: think of it like something you'd see on adult swim
 birdstone#3073: helluva boss, you can watch it on youtube
there's a lot of dark humor and sexual themes if you're fine with that
 unityAccount#7810: What is it called?
 AquaduckStudio#0780: eggs, sausage, potatoes
 birdstone#3073: lmao yup i love that show
 AquaduckStudio#0780: im eating a nice plate of american breakfast this morning
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: "i ate a nice plate of spaghetti today"
 unityAccount#7810:  Your banner or whatevee that's called seems like it is from the same show as Slam's avatar
 birdstone#3073: "the psychology of rewards"
 Triggered#6897: Ok I guess I can understand
Its the best that there are no prizes
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: if you optimize to win better grades you're not optimizing to make a good game
 Merus#7019: the ol' intrinsic vs extrinsic rewards trick
 Merus#7019: also adding prizes means people try to win the prizes instead of trying to make a cool game in the jam
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: well first of all consider variable team size, people coming from different places, working with different local shipping laws, the cost of fees, etc. i don't actually know what happened, mark just said "we tried, it was a logistical nightmare, i'd love to actually do it but the logistics just don't allow it"
 Triggered#6897: What happened?
 SeanSS#0892: Bro you can buy like 2 copies of hollow knight with that wtf
 Murten#0001: Colour*
 randall#2501: Damn a hoodie under 50$ color me impressed
 BadPiggy#5202: GMTK merch, noice
 Murten#0001: Usually it's the other way around.
 Lawn#1538: If you’re in Europe sure.
 Murten#0001: not bad.
 Murten#0001: ```
Shipping          €3.49 EUR
Handling Fee      €0.77 EUR
Order total       €26.24 EUR
```
 Lawn#1538: Shipping though..
 Murten#0001: Damn, those are actually good prices.
 SeanSS#0892: Aw Sadge
 birdstone#3073: oh hey i bought that last month
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: sadly mark tried this already in the first editions and it was a logistical nightmare
 SeanSS#0892: Petition to give free hoodies for the winners
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: maybe next year's!
 SeanSS#0892: Shipping doe...
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: oh i'd love the hoodie... can't afford it tho t~t
 Nobody6502#8971: Ye
 Nobody6502#8971: Eee the jam merch looks so cool why is the only link to it in like one gmtk video and not somewhere in this discord
 caibi#2508: How many editors you have. I have 5(IDEA, PyCharm, Atom, VSC and VS)
 darlingS#1797: I guess. I haven't dived into Undertale lore lately
 darlingS#1797: Something something beware the man who speaks in hands
 darlingS#1797: Purely off of theory fodder
 darlingS#1797: In the future, we all speak wingdings and scare the crap out of MatPat
 BadPiggy#5202: ( oinks in angry chainsaw noises from DOOM )
 darlingS#1797: Beep Boop skadoop
 Gallow#3741: The future is speaking dial up
 darlingS#1797: I'm gonna speak like boyfriend from Friday night funkin without the massive fanbase
 caibi#2508: beep beep beep beep, beep beep. Beep beep? beep beep beep beep, beep. beebee: ~~beep beep beep beep~~
 DrNukeLear#2414: Or worse.... simlish
 darlingS#1797: What if we all just spoke video game voice beeps
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: truly, it would be awful for the economy
 DrNukeLear#2414: Hopefully cockney rhyming slang.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: and a *lot* of linguists would lose a job
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: What we'd gain in universal understanding, we'd lose in cool features that not every language has
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: あ、そうです。
 caibi#2508: well, coding time is over, I wrote 326 line C++ in 1h! Let play some *CS:GO*
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: Life isn't worth living if you're not constantly one spicy せんぱい ('senpai') message away from Slam banhammering you
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i'm going to be honest... the fact that slam is the second in command in this ship, from what little i saw of him, is somewhat worrying for reasons i cant fully articulate
 lilburlap#8480: Ehhh not really into gambling tbh
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: yes but i can't confirm if that will be specially good or specially bad
 lilburlap#8480: Will it get me special teatment?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i may be a lowly jam partecipant but i do still retain my pride
 Merus#7019: he's the longest-serving mod, so the other mods look up to him
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i am not goint to do that!
 Merus#7019: going back to find where Slam posted that meme before reminded me that I need to tell you all: Slam loves it when you call him mod sempai
 caibi#2508: coding some potato program......(Learning C++)
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: this isn't a jam this is just a safari to catch Mark Brown in his natural habitat
 lilburlap#8480: Welp I need to stick around now
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: it's 3 hours of sleep semi-delirious mark
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: "oh sorry i gave you only 10 minutes. meant to give you one hour like i did with your mate. there you go"
 caibi#2508: everyone will mad about this, I think?
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: there's the post jam livestreams but that's not really normal mark
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i saw one of those yesterday with two kids being somewhat annoying with pings @ him
 unityAccount#7810: You should check his livestreams if you haven't already.
 SlamBamActionman#7160: More sick burns most of the time
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i do imagine that mark is like probably Quite different from his more calm, documentary-esque persona he puts up for the channel
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: so when the jam starts the number of actual active users goes up by dozens of times
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: it's just, most of the 'patron users' in the sidebar are people who signed up to mark's patreon and had discord linked but have never posted and in many cases probably don't even know they're here
 SlamBamActionman#7160: All I'm saying is you're missing out on some great Mark Brown content
 darlingS#1797: Welp, I'm leaving after this disturbing revelation
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: mark truly explores the limits of game design i guess!
 SlamBamActionman#7160: urine ruminations
 caibi#2508: this server is always telling me that ***"You are poor, get some money dumpy dumpy!"***
 SlamBamActionman#7160: piss ponderings
 Murten#0001: 🤨
 Merus#7019: two days ago Slam was like "I better not post this in the public channels" and I was all "I dare you"
 SlamBamActionman#7160: weewee thoughts
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Nope it's meant to be there
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: THAT LINE BREAK IS VERY VERY VERY UNFORTUNATE THERE
 lilburlap#8480: no...
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: constant ridicule
 lilburlap#8480: Is it constant ridicule or do they actually talk about their own things? /j
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: awesome. I am but a little lab rat to the patrons now
 Merus#7019: but otherwise yes
 Merus#7019: it's not secret
 Merus#7019: no
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: yes
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i hope the patrons have a channel where they're secretly making fun of us all
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: the paywall only keeps out *most* of the dumdums
 darlingS#1797: Rip merus' giblets
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: we'd ban them probably
 caibi#2508: what if after the jam, Patrons did something *illegal*, what will mods do?
 lilburlap#8480: Oh no
 darlingS#1797: The circle of life
 Merus#7019: I CAN'T FIND MY GIBLETS
 SlamBamActionman#7160: and also i smack them out of the air
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: they're like mayflies - the mod helpers live brief beautiful lives of complete chaos before dying off and going into stasis until next year
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: not entirely unconvinced that slam bam isn't mr beast...
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Cut from the same cloth
 SlamBamActionman#7160: We're were much the same, you and I
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Hey! I have like *checks notes* 163 youtube subs!
 lilburlap#8480: Darn I got excited for a moment (No offense to slambam I'm not planning to pay for patreon)
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: No just me! (as far as I'm aware) I was here before I started doing youtube though so mark couldn't kick me out for my crimes against youtube
 SlamBamActionman#7160: I create really good jokes in the Patreon chats
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: thankfully, i'll be focused on making a game! funny how things work out!
 caibi#2508: mod helper will disappear from the world when the jam ends
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: expect it to get dramatically worse when the floodgates open
 lilburlap#8480: Wait are the other mods content creators?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: there have been quite a few in just the 3 days ive been here
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: normally the server is so chill that we really don't need 3 regular mods - but there are thousands of people piling in here over the jam and there's a lot of idiots to deal with
 darlingS#1797: Makes sense with the influx of jammers
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: ahh, i see. makes sense
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Mod helpers are only for the jam
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: actually i'm kind of curious - are mod helpers a thing only for the game jam, or are they a feature of the server as a whole? do they actually have any powers or do they just report to mods?
 caibi#2508: oh, make sense
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: nope
 caibi#2508: can mod helper mute mods?
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: indeed we can
 darlingS#1797: I didn't realise because, knowing I'm a temporary server member due to being too poor to patreon anyone, I just follow the coloured names and didn't look through the actual list of mods
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: been meaning to watch the nostalgia video, it popped in my homepage thanks to the algorithm but havent had the time to watch it because college is actual, literal hell
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: they get instantly banned for poor taste
 Merus#7019: it is always very funny
 Merus#7019: we occasionally get people linking to Adam's videos in the patron channels without realising that he's here and a mod
 caibi#2508: I think I know why will this happened, unity is doing all the initialize and I'm deleting default asset, that cause a lots of damage to my big boy
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: last video i watched abt game design i thiiiink was mark's video on the different kinds of randomness
 darlingS#1797: It just sorta clicked and brain go AAAA
 darlingS#1797: I just wasn't expecting it I'm literally mid binge watching his videos
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: two content makers... IN THE SAME PLACE? Unimaginable.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: ha
 Triggered#6897: Cool maybe windows was updating in bg
 darlingS#1797: Infinity war is no longer the most ambitious crossover
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: that is indeed me
 darlingS#1797: Sorry to be a pain but is that THE architect of games I see or am I confusing icons
 caibi#2508: well, let's get out that things in mind, it's suddenly only take me 2gb RAM and 6% of SSD now
 randall#2501: trying to do more than 1 seems overwhelming
 randall#2501: especially when other people are putting 8+ hours into a project a day.
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: you don't want to be in a position where you sign up for more work than you can reasonably do in 48 hours and end up letting people down
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i could see someone overseeing multiple projects as a manager
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: not forbidden, but doing one jam entry is hard enough work already!
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: you're fully allowed to. not really recommended though
 caibi#2508: Ok
 SpencerChamp#7627: Is it forbidden / bad taste to join multiple projects?
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: intel driver stuff is kind of a mess right now. there might be a more recent beta driver
 Triggered#6897: I am not trying to be a mod just I was thinking if we should chat about it at 
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: i just had a unity project that would crash the editor when loaded until i updated my gpu driver - though that was nvidia, not intel
 Ash Badas#2999: Hey all, sup today!
 caibi#2508: and discord is using 3% of my GPU what the ||heck||??
 Redline#7370: well then I guess there's something with your unity project then
 caibi#2508: GPU RAM is 7.9(Total 8.0)gb
 Redline#7370: hmm
 Triggered#6897: The only sol. I can think of other then updating/degrading driver version is to re-install unity
 Triggered#6897: Since when?
 Redline#7370: hmm then update drivers I guess
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: have you tried downloading the gpu driver directly from intel
 caibi#2508: yes, always
 caibi#2508: full RAM is 15.7g
 Triggered#6897: Is it happening on ither projects ss well
 caibi#2508: available RAM without any other application such as Windows System
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: from the screenshot it looked like this person's computer has 16 gb of ram avialable? so its probably not that
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: even if it is running out of ram it shouldn't just crash. run very slowly, sure
 Redline#7370: is that your full computer's RAM or just the dedicated RAM for your igpu
 Triggered#6897: I have used unity in 4gb ram so yeah eating up 8 gigs indeed strange
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: a few years ago i could run it (with difficulty) on a 4gb potato tower
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: it's probably a driver thing
 Redline#7370: I've seen over 11gb
 caibi#2508: 8g
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: 8 gigabytes occupied by unity at once does seem rather strange
 Redline#7370: the question is how much RAM it has to work with
 Redline#7370: yea so it's an iGPU
 caibi#2508: I don't know the name of GPU, it's ***in*** the CPU
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: no, it's the higher power cpus usually used in gaming laptops with dgpus. the gpu is frequently smaller than on a u-series part
 Redline#7370: H is high performance graphics
 Triggered#6897: Not to say Unity is bad but it can be tedious sometimes
Why dont you try creating a new project and then transferring your files over to that see if it works
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: it's quite odd to have a H series cpu and no dedicated gpu
 Redline#7370: that should be fine maybe
 caibi#2508: 11th Gen Intel Core i5-11300H 3.10GHz
 caibi#2508: intel iRIS
 Triggered#6897: I also ran into an issues with unity the error said
Something due to an **UNKNOWN ERROR**
I ways wanted to try godot and have been using it since
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: also do you actually have a graphics driver. because i have seen it happen where people just. don't. somehow
 Redline#7370: that's not a thing
 caibi#2508: Core graphics card
 Redline#7370: what hardware you trying to run that thing on?
 caibi#2508: hmm, unity editor always crash when using URP or HDRP
 Triggered#6897: But honestly whats the problem if you dont mind telling?
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: ^
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: pour monster energy on your computer's ram it makes it faster (< please. please don't actually do this)
 Triggered#6897: ~~or goodbye~~
 SeanSS#0892: Tuck it into bed
 SeanSS#0892: Kiss it goodnight
 caibi#2508: ~~slap the monitor~~ give him some energy snack
 Triggered#6897: IDK your boy you know better
 caibi#2508: How to give it love
 SeanSS#0892: Give it some snackies
 Triggered#6897: Give it some love and it will behave like a good kid.
 caibi#2508: I hate my poor computer
 caibi#2508: very cool, unity crashed
 Jeker#3389: .
 caibi#2508: Oh no, my *Tencent QQ* crashed
 SeanSS#0892: Theyre just trying to be assholes at this point
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: that's not even something done for monetary gain that's like... just outright malicious
 Merus#7019: absolutely diabolical
 Merus#7019: and so naturally you log in and they have your credentials
 Merus#7019: the worst I've heard of is using a hacked account to send someone an accusation that you said something extremely inappropriate to someone else, and there are pictures on this Discord called Hall of Shame, and they're blocking you as a cautionary measure
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Noted
 caibi#2508: ha, I finally deleted the default assets! I swear to god **I WILL NEVER USE UNREAL UNTIL I GET RTX Graphics Card Series**
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: also just dont trust people who send you links or anything like that over DMs unprovoked. report spam and move on
 SeanSS#0892: Embed fail
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: it wasn't a discord attachment, it was a link to a page that contained two things: a broken image and a redirect link that sent you to the page where you would log in. the person would ask you if the image would load for you, and some would fall for it by clicking open original, because when the phishers sent the link the embedding process discord uses would see the image and try to embed *that*, but since it was broken, it would not load
 Pixstatic#3464: that was a good video
 Jeker#3389: check out linux mint
 SeanSS#0892: Yea thats why
 Jeker#3389: if these people dedicated their time to doing something useful we would be living in 2199
 JuliusCube#8501: but discord attachments dont need your login credentials, right?
 caibi#2508: windows is so bad, computer is dying so quickly, but linux is hard to *install*, I don't have the image file of MacOS
 Jeker#3389: its so evil, but so genius
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: on one hand i'm fascinated by the inventiveness on the other, jesus christ that is an evil method to get people's credentials
 SeanSS#0892: Yeah I saw that too
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i saw a video recently of something phishers made abusign the embed system, where they sent people an image that wouldn't load (on purpose) that was a link to a page which if you opened, would redirect you to a phishing page mimicking discord's log in page to get your log in credentials
 Tapu#9161: Right one reminds me of 👽
 Murten#0001: I just click it and hope for the best. :D
 JuliusCube#8501: cool but that last one will stay in my nightmares for 30 years bc that face is terrifying
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: thanks!
 Triggered#6897: Expectation Imagination Reality
Looks cute between
 SeanSS#0892: Love the far right one looks goofy
 Merus#7019: I'm also using a link scanner to check a link before I click it
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: nice
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: (The left one is just Pokémon)
 JuliusCube#8501: i dont think you even need to sign up for imgur
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i know there's a lot of like young people here who might not know this stuff, so
 Merus#7019: doesn't do anything not being used, and most OSes can instantly release memory for application use
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: this is meant to be directed at everyone btw
 Merus#7019: Windows, like most operating systems, will use as much memory as is available
 Jeker#3389: doesent windows 10 like use a lot by default?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: btw if you ever click a link someone sends you that redirects to ANY log in page NEVER input anything. reminder from a cybersec-aware friend
 caibi#2508: you guys only know imgur? I can't sign up on that, it need phone number, and I don't have a stupid SIM card
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: yeah the image is fine but don't post sketchy looking links with really vague "hey I'm totally a phishing bot hijacking someone's account" descriptions
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: There should be more games for pets IMO
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: like 8 gigs. that is... A lot
 Enginak#4100: ok thanks bro
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: clicked that link yeah it's just a picture of unity occupying a LOT of memory
 SeanSS#0892: We'll see Im still hopeful
 Pixstatic#3464: ibb.co is safe, it's an image site
 caibi#2508: trust me, I don't touch the rule, trust trust
 JuliusCube#8501: im going to *not* click on that but okay
 Jeker#3389: i doubt valve will do shit tbh
 Pixstatic#3464: I just meant like, the concept of a 'slur' is not a slur in and of itself, just a boring conversation topic
 SeanSS#0892: Im not too sure about this link lol
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: that is all
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: talk about videogames not slurs
 SeanSS#0892: #savetf2
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: yeah, but the discussion can slide into unfortunate territories
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: I'm not even sure what you're trying to say here but let's move on
 Jeker#3389: TF2 HIGHLANDER. ENOUGH SAID.
 Pixstatic#3464: I mean I'm not necessarily arguing with you but the concept of a slur is not exactly hurting anyone unless boredom can manifest as physical agony
 JuliusCube#8501: thats a better idea
 BadPiggy#5202: Pigs
 Jeker#3389: how about we talk about cats?
 JuliusCube#8501: agree
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: I'll actually  for that as an FYI, let's nix the casual chat about slurs please
 Stopa#6148: Try competitive ladder in Starcraft 2 then.
 Pixstatic#3464: @ mods ban this user
 SeanSS#0892: Ngl last years jam was the most stressed ive ever been in my life
 JuliusCube#8501: so if i just say: 🇭 , you would assume that's a slur?
 Pixstatic#3464: but the problem was that the game kinda sucked
 Pixstatic#3464: I mean my game did have a "control" resource
 Stopa#6148: I like punnable themes that can be interpreted in multiple ways
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: stanley's parable ultra deluxe moment
 MaxwellTheApe#6698: out of control was cool
 Pixstatic#3464: "out of control" had so many pun opportunities that I understood when I participated but missed out on in gameplay
 BadPiggy#5202: " only one " and " dual purpose mechanics " are honestly the only old themes I liked.
 Jeker#3389: I just realised how immature i am
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i might personally practice thinking of ideas for the previous jam themes. stuff like joined together seems interesting
 Merus#7019: absolutely life changing
 JuliusCube#8501: never actually knew that but i have been doing it for the past year like that anyway
 Stopa#6148: so no theme then?
 Jeker#3389: i wont submit anything then
 SeanSS#0892: What if the theme is the friends we made along the way
 Pixstatic#3464: man if you can look at 60 pixel matrix configurations in a second and tell me there's story you must have great imagination
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: btw, quick tip if you dont feel like toggling the ping thing when you reply - if you old shift while you click on the button to reply you get while hovering a message, it sets the notification tooltip to off automatically
 Jeker#3389: this sounded a lot better in my head to be honest
 SeanSS#0892: Woah thats some meta stuff right there
 JuliusCube#8501: possible themes:
- pants are for losers
- shoot to move
- something else idk
 Jeker#3389: well the story at least i guess
 BadPiggy#5202: Every game is a figment of our imagination ?
 Jeker#3389: isnt that, technically every game?
 Pixstatic#3464: ah
 JuliusCube#8501: the incident was last year so new year new me i guess.
 Pixstatic#3464: uninstall unity and submit the log file from the uninstaller
 SeanSS#0892: What if the theme is just a figment of our imagination
 Triggered#6897: Then I'll make a game about black hole
 Jeker#3389: i am suprissed he wasent mailed to brazil or something
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: it'd be a bad jam?
 SeanSS#0892: Guys what if the theme is nothing at all 🤯
 Pixstatic#3464: > "I'm  new here, say hi!"
> pinging mark 47 times in 2 days in replies
 Redline#7370: I'm already preparing my stream stuff
 JuliusCube#8501: it was actually probably less than 47 but it was above 20
 BadPiggy#5202: 2 days until the jam argh
 SeanSS#0892: The grind never stops
 JuliusCube#8501: no idea
 Stopa#6148: how are you still here?
 JuliusCube#8501: agreed
 Jeker#3389: holy shit
 SeanSS#0892: Yeye ofc ofc
 Pixstatic#3464: ah yes that would be an incident
 dardasaba#9759: Sounds like many incidents, not one :P
 JuliusCube#8501: pinging mark 47 times in 2 days in replies
 Merus#7019: like it's important to us that people feel welcome and included here, and that (and wanting to reduce the mod burden that comes from that) is where a lot of the rules come from
 SeanSS#0892: ten men died that night
 Jeker#3389: oh damn whats *the incident*?
 JuliusCube#8501: i just dont ping people when i reply usually after *the incident*
i dont mind when others do it
 Pixstatic#3464: no please ping me if you reply to me it helps a lot
 SeanSS#0892: I dont mind
 Jeker#3389: btw, you guys mind pings when replying?
 Merus#7019: I mean, can they tell?
 Jeker#3389: my guy offended at least 20 minority groups in one sentnce 👍
 Pixstatic#3464: I don't know what you said but I'm offended anyway
 JuliusCube#8501: weuioyaf awepugi fudsapf
 Pixstatic#3464: I will now assume every letter you type is an encoded slur
 JuliusCube#8501: *proceeds to create their own conlang and starts cursing in it that way nobody would know that they're cursing*
 Princent Vice#4280: That’s it, cancelling BadPiggy
 SeanSS#0892: How dare you say that to my mother
 BadPiggy#5202: Oink
 Jeker#3389: how can we know you didnt oink slurs?
 Pixstatic#3464: his idea of a universe is so much more cozy than this dumb one I live in, I'm in
 BadPiggy#5202: ( oinks in profanities )
 Lawn#1538: He’s planning to simulate a new universe. I hope he takes some of us with him.
 Jeker#3389: ok, fuck yes, fucking thank you, it was about fucking time
 SeanSS#0892: Oh fuck yeah
 Merus#7019: go fuckin' nuts
 Pixstatic#3464: imagine the feeling of your face rearranging itself to be attractive, must be excruciating
 Lawn#1538: I associate curse with the occult.
Swearing is the more common term here. My bad, curse away .
 SeanSS#0892: Shakala *you are now cursed with good looks and immense knowledge*
 JuliusCube#8501: *proceeds to put a curse of binding dragon head on everyone with a dispenser*
 Pixstatic#3464: man just casually learns some complicated programming topic because he feels like it and then proceeds to become a fuckin god at it and inspire the internet with his humbly holy mp4s
 Jeker#3389: I will now proceed to read out every curse on the english dictionary (jk, obviously)
 BadPiggy#5202: The curse of the pig shall frown upon you all
Jk
But fr
 Tapu#9161: *Proceeds to put curse of binding on everyone's pants*
 Jeker#3389: oh nice
 Lawn#1538: Oh right, that kind of curse. Haha
 Teslobo#8274: 
 Teslobo#8274: Yeah this has always been fine
 Teslobo#8274: Oh you were joking
 Teslobo#8274: We've historically had no problems with -
 Lawn#1538: I don’t want no curse.
 Jeker#3389: but, a simple "fuck" and "shit" is allowed right?
 Teslobo#8274: Really?
 BadPiggy#5202: Brief rounds ?
We doing this Rocky Balboa style
Going 12 rounds
 Teslobo#8274: Yes, just don't go into slur territory
 Lawn#1538: No. Thanks.
 JuliusCube#8501: those are great
however, he hasnt made anything regarding his Outer Wilds-inspired game which is very sebastian lague of him to do but I wanna know if he's still continuing it or not.
 SeanSS#0892: Can I curse in this server?
 Princent Vice#4280: Putting that in my back pocket for later
 Lawn#1538: He’s a damn savant.
 Pixstatic#3464: as is he
 Lawn#1538: See link above. However, Sebastian’s bezier tool is awesome!
 Jeker#3389: Like, trying to make something without a tutorial or something
 Pixstatic#3464: if it isn't a boxing game with brief rounds I will execute you right here and right now
 Jeker#3389: Something I really like doing is just messing around an engine
 Tapu#9161: His videos are meditating
 Lawn#1538: Great resource for budding tech artists.
 BadPiggy#5202: I'ma make a fighting game about boxers vs briefs
The loser wears pants
 Pixstatic#3464: I have no idea what you're talking about but mention of bezier curves makes me want to watch all of Sebastian Lague's videos a 17th time
 Lawn#1538: Yep.
 JuliusCube#8501: yeah i have then
 SeanSS#0892: But theyre for losers
 poggerat#6311: Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh
 Pixstatic#3464: poor mark, just let the man wear pants
 Tapu#9161: I like her bezier curves video
 Jeker#3389: yeah it is
 Lawn#1538: Shaders, math, all sorts.
 poggerat#6311: is the theme pants are for losers tho
 Jeker#3389: oh wait thats the girl that did the explaining shaders stuff right?
 Wokarol#0940: Fair
 Tapu#9161: There can always be undies
 JuliusCube#8501: yeah i have
theyre the one who made beauty of bezier curves right?
 BadPiggy#5202: Lol.
True
 Wokarol#0940: What, but it was supposed to be a SFW jam... right?
 Venno9#2775: anyone looking for a designer for this jam?
 poggerat#6311: is it pants are for losers?
 SeanSS#0892: You see, I love this too until it stops working then I hate everything
 Lawn#1538: I’d be surprised if you haven’t, given how much you dig math.
 Lawn#1538: Freya is boss. Have you watched her stuff on YouTube?
 Jeker#3389: Do you get a lot of stuff like this? lol
 BadPiggy#5202: I love designing enemy AI and combat encounters
 SeanSS#0892: I'm mario maker brain rotted 😎
 Tapu#9161: It's "pants are for losers"
 Pixstatic#3464: sigh
 poggerat#6311:  as a joke can u tell me wat theme is pls it will be funny trust
 Pixstatic#3464: the best part is making your terrible game look pretty, that's what I spend all day doing
 SeanSS#0892: Level design is the most fun part for me lol
 Jeker#3389: uh oh i think i started a war
 BadPiggy#5202: I might try love2d at some point
But the problem with going 2.5D is that it's hard to go back to 2D afterwards lol
 Jeker#3389: now level design...that can burn in hell
 Jeker#3389: fair, but i think the biggest part i enjoy is either, game design or programming
 Pixstatic#3464: you can @ me when you reply lol it helps readability a lot (you don't have to but I won't mind)
 BadPiggy#5202: I would rather get down and dirty with game design rather than game engine Dev lol
 Pixstatic#3464: I like monogame
 Tapu#9161: Lots of if else statements just to manage the different screens
 Jeker#3389: i just patched that in, no big deal really
 Jeker#3389: MonoGame had no "getPixel" function...yeah that was shit
 Pixstatic#3464: I was trying to make a game using only webgl and python at one point but then I realised how much stuff unity does for me and decided that I'm a lazy, boring little man
 Jeker#3389: I use: Unity, Rider and aseprite some times
 BadPiggy#5202: Rip
Monogame can be a real pain lol
But love2d should be fine.
 Jeker#3389: on top of monogame or love2d or something
 SeanSS#0892: Gl with that soldier o7
 BadPiggy#5202: Unity, vscode and Photoshop. The only tools I use for gamedev kek
 Jeker#3389: i am thinking of making my own engine lol
 Pixstatic#3464: I like making my own tools but god damn do I hate switching between programs
 Jeker#3389: like, not as a job, thats what i had the most expirience with
 JuliusCube#8501: it does look cool tho
 SeanSS#0892: Ooo naice
 Jeker#3389: i mean, i am a software developer soooo yeah
 SeanSS#0892: Making your own stuff is also cool and kinda would evolve with your project as it goes
 Pixstatic#3464: there's always advantages to highly specific tooling
 Jeker#3389: oops, i forgot tiled existed
 JuliusCube#8501: im not spending $90 on basic shapes
at least i hope im not.
 SeanSS#0892: There are also other apps like tiled that export directly to the built in tilemap feature afaik so I prefer to use those instead
 Pixstatic#3464: this server really makes me wish discord had a "dynamic slowmode" option so the delay could be turned down during slow chat periods... I like to space what I'm saying across multiple messages
 Jeker#3389: And I dont get the problem with making your own stuff lol
 Pixstatic#3464: I mean it isn't exactly all-purpose
 Jeker#3389: it does, but i dont like it
 Lawn#1538: If you can afford it, there’s Shapes by Freya Holmer.
 SeanSS#0892: Doesnt unity already have a tilemap editor doe?
 JuliusCube#8501: *hexagon
 Pixstatic#3464: it's personal taste tho
 Murten#0001: JuliusSquare.
 Pixstatic#3464: no I mean the actual tools for tile based level creation
 Jeker#3389: i mean, its like 2 for loops
 JuliusCube#8501: listen i never actually draw anything the only thing i make with photoshop is basic shapes like circles with outlines, triangles (because unity doesnt have primitive n-gons anymore), etc
 Pixstatic#3464: but that functionality is also entirely doable by adding some clickable widgets to unity which is much more condusive to iteration imo
 Jeker#3389: for my level editor, i just export everything to a json, and itterate through that to add tiles to the scene
 Redline#7370: photoshop gang 😎
 Pixstatic#3464: you use *photoshop* for *art*???
 Pixstatic#3464: jams for me look like a lot of prefab dragging
 JuliusCube#8501: im using the latest photoshop version because 2D>3D
 Jeker#3389: I am honestly kinda sad i stack with unity lol
 Redline#7370: I'm pretty sure that's not a version but I'm using 3.0.0
 Jeker#3389: mine has the absoloute basic functionality
 SeanSS#0892: for my workflow I prefer to make tools in the beginning so that I can have an easier time iterating
 caibi#2508: Which *Blender* version are you guys using, mine is 3.93.7
 Jeker#3389: I mean, a level editor isnt that hard
 JuliusCube#8501: i have made a level editor in 2 days before
cant say it was good or anything because it wasnt
 Pixstatic#3464: god no lol
 Jeker#3389: i mean, i have made one for another project
 SeanSS#0892: But idk if its worth it to make a level editor during the jam doe
 Murten#0001: ty ty.
 JuliusCube#8501: ok ill give you 1/16th credit
 SeanSS#0892: I mean if you can do it, then I dont see why not
 Pixstatic#3464: you can add quite a lot of functionality to unity itself but I do agree that there is some benefit to writing external tools to do things if that's what you mean
 Murten#0001: But it was fast.
 JuliusCube#8501: 1. thats not an infinite sum/product
2. thats not a representation of sin)
 Jeker#3389: I am not talking about customizing it, i am more so talking about adding your own functionality
 Pixstatic#3464: no but I wouldn't really call that "customising the editor"
 Murten#0001: 12
 Jeker#3389: What if you want to make something like a level editor? Is it worth to do it in-unity?
 JuliusCube#8501: time for daily math question #4:
Write an infinite series and/or product representation of sin)
the hard part here isnt actually doing it. its writing the answer out in discord.
 Pixstatic#3464: I like having control but I don't like it enough to stop being lazy :)
 Jeker#3389: Eh, i guess, i personally preefer having absolute control tho
 Pixstatic#3464: you don't have to do too much fancy stuff to start customising the editor to your liking
 Pixstatic#3464: unity's editor scripting tools are pretty great either way
 Jeker#3389: You can use something like WPF, and make applications in C#
 Jeker#3389: i dont want to scare anyone with this btw
 dardasaba#9759: Good night
 Jeker#3389: Have a nice sleep mate
 Snage#1337: Alr ima try to fix my sleep schedule, have a good day y’all will probably see u later
 Jeker#3389: You can technically do that with packages, but I had a much easier time just making it a seperate applicaiton in something like C++
 Snage#1337: Darn thx tho this is good knowledge
 Pixstatic#3464: unity is so good, shame it's so bad tho
 Jeker#3389: yeah, but its possible
 dardasaba#9759: Idk how hard is it to do in unity so I can't answer that
 Pixstatic#3464: well "turing complete" does not mean "practical" or "accomplishable in any reasonable timeframe"
 Snage#1337: Easier than people who do it in unity?
 dardasaba#9759: And if it's "professional" enough, maybe it will even get added to the source code
 Jeker#3389: i made my own tools, but as a seperate application
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: isn't pico8 kind of like this too?
 dardasaba#9759: Indeed, and people do that
 Jeker#3389: Anything that is turing complete
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: but it does mean that once you get comfortable using the engine you can also make custom tools and plug ins as if they were part of a game
 Pixstatic#3464: I'm pretty sure this can be done in scratch lol
 Jeker#3389: There is i dont remember what its called tho
 Snage#1337: Turing complete or something??
 dardasaba#9759: Godot inside Godot 👀
 Snage#1337: Isn’t there a term for that??
 SeanSS#0892: Double the Godot, double the power
 Jeker#3389: thats not that impressive, its a techinque commonly used in programming languages
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: Godot feels like the exact opposite end of UE to me
 dardasaba#9759: Which means, technically you can replicate all of Godot's features inside your own Godot project
~~although why would you do that lol~~
 SeanSS#0892: Woah
 dardasaba#9759: Yeah, Godot is made in Godot ;)
 Snage#1337: Surely you jest?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: the entire engine is also built as a Godot project itself i think
 dardasaba#9759: And games made with it are also (usually) lightweight (looking at you, unreal :P)
 dardasaba#9759: The entire engine is less than 40 mb
 Pixstatic#3464: I feel good right now knowing that I can solve my problem of intense shivering by wearing my gmtk game jam hoodie that I only just remembered actually arrived yesterday
 Snage#1337: What do you guys mean by lightweight btw? Like small file size?
 Jeker#3389: Just, "Godot isnt responding"
 Jeker#3389: nope
 dardasaba#9759: That's really weird
Do you get any error?
 Pixstatic#3464: until it crashes and it takes a whole day to fix whatever caused it lolll
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: well now *you* are scary to me
 dardasaba#9759: I've heard that to add export to a different platform in Unity you gotta reformat your game or something which can take a lot of time for bigger projects xD
Pfft smh
 Jeker#3389: Oh, alright! Thanks mate
 Redline#7370: based
 Pixstatic#3464: I am not scared I just never ever close unity
 Jeker#3389: why the hell do you all get such smooth expiriences with godot? for me it crashes just as i open it
 dardasaba#9759: xD
 Snage#1337: 💀
 Pixstatic#3464: but for general unity advice basically anything after 2018 is *fine* if it's got the features you want. There are ups and downs to newer versions
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: scaring unity users by opening Godot and clicking a project name and itt just loading in like a few seconds (< joking)
 Tornado#0975: Right
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: You're fine to use it. My team is using 2021.3.5f1 for this one.
 Jeker#3389: yo btw, when your game is done, can you ping me? Cause I really want to see what game you guys will make
 Pixstatic#3464: you can use whatever you want for the jam so long as it can export to a platform people can play
 Snage#1337: Oh ok 👍
 Tornado#0975: ahh is it i think its from the start of 2021
 Jeker#3389: its from like, 2020
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: My GMTK Game Jam team. I'm actually the leader, but... yeah.
 Redline#7370: nothing is too old
 dardasaba#9759: Super lightweight + everything is instant (loading the engine, running a project, exporting, etc etc)... No such thing as waiting in godot ;)
 Snage#1337: Can I ask what you r the 11th teammate of?
 Pixstatic#3464: I mean you could argue that you *aren't* biased seeing as you must've chosen godot as the engine you use for a reason
 Tornado#0975: guys is 2020.3.26f1 fine to use or is it old
 caibi#2508: jesus, BIY is 76HKD on steam, what is the diffrent between steam and itch.io?
 Pixstatic#3464: not even once
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: Godots awesome - it takes some time to get used to but the hierarchy system for the nodes allows it for a great deal of modularity. plus it's super light weight!
 Redline#7370: we would **never** spam...
 Snage#1337: Yea didn’t mean to reply just meant to send generally but thx
 Murten#0001: 2 stickers were send....
 PURE [YAMIU 保護者]#3112: haha thanks ! it was a super fun one for sure !
 theChief#0001: don't spam the stickers, I have no qualms with handing out mutes 😉
 dardasaba#9759: I assume wrong reply, anyway I say yes but I'm kinda biased as a godot user :P
 theChief#0001: I think that was genuinely one of the best jam games I've done, the music was on fire too - especially with the adaptive soundtrack 😁
 Pixstatic#3464:
 Murten#0001: I broke the system.
 Redline#7370: omg a gif
 Snage#1337: Lol
 Murten#0001:
 Pixstatic#3464: ahem it's actually 22:06 get it right
 Snage#1337: Is godo worth learning to switch or nah
 Redline#7370: I'm using the abbsolute latest 2022.1.idk
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Time is relative!
 PURE [YAMIU 保護者]#3112: yup !
 dardasaba#9759: Timezones are a thing ;)
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: 
 PURE [YAMIU 保護者]#3112: no we actually did one together lmao
 theChief#0001: wait no we did rhythm jam! Gustavo go 
 Pixstatic#3464: I'm just using the current LTS which has been quite a jarring upgrade from... 2019.1.19f1
 Murten#0001: But good morning.
 DrNukeLear#2414: What do you have installed?
 Snage#1337: 5am where I am
 Tornado#0975: should i upgrade or no hmm
 Murten#0001: It's 2:05PM.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Yooooooooo!!
 **GOOD MORNING!** 
 DrNukeLear#2414: Latest version of 2021
 Snage#1337: I mean it’s good to update every now and then
 PURE [YAMIU 保護者]#3112: 😏
 Pixstatic#3464: I mean most cities here are like this but yeah that's what I was going for
 Snage#1337: ^
 Tornado#0975: i am thinking if i should use the one i have installed atm or install a new one
 Murten#0001: That one that I happen to have installed atm.
 Hellsnake#9670: haha
 theChief#0001: hey look pure is here too!
 Snage#1337: I’m out in AriZona with that 43.3C(110F) dry heat
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: being smack middle in the Mediterranean is awesome honestly. the other day I saw a dolphin right next to me while I was on a walk on the beach side
 theChief#0001: yep, everyone always says that 😂
 PURE [YAMIU 保護者]#3112: oh hi mark
 Tornado#0975: what verson of unity yall gonna use
 Lawn#1538: So… Brisbane.
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Welp time to go outside and read. Perfcet sunny weather atm.
 Yollie#2239: i still remember that time when my family and i went on a 3 day holiday somewhere on the great ocean road and when we arrived a bushfire literally started the same day on a nearby hill
 Hellsnake#9670: surprised to see you there x)
 DrNukeLear#2414: Bloody feels like it in Wales.
 Pixstatic#3464: basically 
 Hellsnake#9670: oh hello Chief
 theChief#0001: planet's on fire I guess
 caibi#2508: have you guys joined the GameOff jam?
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I'm not that far from Britain. In Belgium atm it's okay, yesterday it was 27 I belief but today it is like a nice 24-25 so it isn't that bad. (Luckily!)
 DrNukeLear#2414: WHY IS IT SO HOT!
 Yollie#2239: basically melbourne
 Pixstatic#3464: we get to 40 degrees in summer a lot of years it's very cold here too. my body thermometer is made for a different country tbh
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: I'm near the sea so you can imagine how humid it gets
 Murten#0001: In Celsius you can just say anything above 30 is to hot.
 theChief#0001: see 27 in britain is like 50 elsewhere, it's so humid and also british people are good at complaining
 Snage#1337: How humid is it?
 dardasaba#9759: ...
18°C is considered very cold here xD
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: It's a nice relaxing summer here. It's like 27C.
 Yollie#2239: if theres anything talking to people from different places has told me is that damn australia is really hot compared to other places
 Snage#1337: *sad american calculator noises*
 Murten#0001: 😐
 Pixstatic#3464: I miss a week ago when it was 7 degrees
 Pixstatic#3464: I'm boiling to death it's 18 degrees and the dead middle of winter here
 Murten#0001: And if people are loud and obnoxious you can just mute them.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: I'm in italy actually
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Damn. Sun to be burning there.
 theChief#0001: ah a fellow brit melting in the heat. It's going to get up to 35C in sheffield on tuesday 😭
 Murten#0001: I usually like to watch people stream the game dev process. You can learn a lot from watching other people work. Its especially fun when everyone is working on games with the same theme; but I get that it is not for everyone.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: someone with embeds repost this. Please.
 Pixstatic#3464: I feel bad for Marks just because of this quote and its variations. Nearly as bad as "Jude"
 Yollie#2239: yeah join the jam wanting to win but dont join it with the expectation to win, the odds are very very very low
 caibi#2508: ~~very popular scam, if you scam the server you get money~~
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I love July, tho I get sun can be annoying.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: oh hey Mark
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: It isnt and most of the time the vc wont even be used.
 dardasaba#9759: Yeah I saw
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: cursing the sun. hate July its the worst month of the year
 Pixstatic#3464: it isn't :)
 Mark Brown#6982: I can’t imagine joining a public VC on a big server. How is that fun
 Pixstatic#3464: "learn unity for FREE *today*, just follow this url and complete a short survey to win FREE unity tutorial videos that will make you a MASTER in ONLY ONE WEEK"
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Has been done before
 SlamBamActionman#7160: We have had public VCs before but they have been notoriously difficult to moderate.
Better to avoid it altogether, but if you wanna team up with people and chat outside the server then that's a-ok
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: How's everyone doing?
 dardasaba#9759: ~~yeah, because they're gonna make you a moderator there too~~
 theChief#0001: I can't tell you how much I don't want to join a server with almost 100,000 members
 dardasaba#9759: It's a very popular scam
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: hi
 theChief#0001: hey emi!
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Heyo
 Merus#7019: we have a channel for this when the jam starts
 theChief#0001: and if it was a scam server it wouldn't have 92k members xD
 Pixstatic#3464: the impression that I got is that nobody is going to punish you too harshly if it's all in the spirit of things
 Merus#7019: it's fine to link to other discords if you want to meet up elsewhere
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: plus I'm not sure why the mod team here would tell you anything about linking a well know gamedev discord server
 caibi#2508: I can search it on youtube dude..
 Pixstatic#3464: I mean the url is literally "brackeys"
 Redline#7370: technically there isn't a rule against it
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: you can send links
 Murten#0001: I'm probably not allowed to send it here since almost nothing seems to be allowed here.
 Murten#0001: And they have a public vc and you can use custom emojis.
 caibi#2508: Let me check the server link, I’ma join it
 Snage#1337: That’s cool
 Murten#0001: Nope, but the discord server is usually active when big game jams happen.
 Pixstatic#3464: so sad
 caibi#2508: no, never, he quited a long time ago
 Snage#1337: Does brackets still upload?
 Pixstatic#3464: I mean winning a game jam (or ranking highly) looks good on you as a developer
 caibi#2508: Mack will make a video to share your game, it can increase your *“reputation”* I think
 Pixstatic#3464: sorry if that sounded rude, you're still totally welcome to participate... just wanted to clear that up 😅
 Pixstatic#3464: they get some free merch but if you're doing this to win stuff then you're missing the point
 Murten#0001: Brackeys server it is then.
 caibi#2508: hope it can back
 Snage#1337: Rip
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: We have had public VC chats before but the moderation was a nightmare
 Murten#0001: 😐
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: The only thing you sign off on by joining the jam is giving mark permission to feature it in videos, it's in the rules on itch
 caibi#2508: get Patron, and then you can see it
 Murten#0001: Will there be a vc channel in this server when the jam starts?
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: The game is yours do whatever you like with it
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: no, the only "prize" is that top 20 may be featured in a video by mark
 caibi#2508: no, you come here just for the prize?
 caibi#2508: can I release the game on steam(make a full version) after I upload the game(demo) as jam project?
 Enginak#4100: Is there any prize for the winner?
 Pixstatic#3464: yeah awesome
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: I have a coding notebook for that
 Pixstatic#3464: I use concepts on my ipad and draw big nonsensical diagrams with little doodles and random scribbles of text everywhere to form a mental picture of what I'm making
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: I'm making a project planner tool in python for programmers, but it's not finished enough to use that
 Pixstatic#3464: I should probably plan things out like that I usually just kinda wing it and then make a trello when winging it stops working
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: it's always, always always ALWAYS a good idea to write down the problems you want to solve to try to find a solution. don't let your ideas fester inside your head! write them down so you won't forget stuff
 Pixstatic#3464: that is in fact a flowchart that you made
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: you mean milanote?
 caibi#2508: layersss!
 Pixstatic#3464: man you're using the application design practices they teach in programming class I'm impressed because I'm too lazy to make flowcharts lol
 JuliusCube#8501: ^^
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: yea
 Jeker#3389: ^
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: never forget layers... when dealing with collisions they're your best friend
 caibi#2508: whatever, I will try my best, the theme isn’t that *restrictive*, so maybe I can try my ***spacy*** idea.
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: oh god I forgot about layers 😂
 Jeker#3389: ok so, tags are so good, i made a "subTag" script for my game
 Pixstatic#3464: it's literally the whole point of layers lol
 Murten#0001: I try to avoid try catch at all cost.
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: yea
 Pixstatic#3464: layersssss
 Murten#0001: Layers go brrrrr.
 Jeker#3389: yeah its generally a cleaner way to do stuff
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: I guess I could use tags maybe
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Oh I think its becuse it could detect non-building colliders
 Yollie#2239: i want to write a blog but im not sure what to put in there
 Pixstatic#3464: I've had some good ones, like the one I was (and still am) working on where you play a cat descending into hell who drinks kombucha and is trying to collect pieces to build a cat cafe space station
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i'm working on a review for neonwhite for that blog actually. writing all of the problems i have with the writing and the repetitiveness of the gameplay and what i think the game should've done to improve
 caibi#2508: ofc, it just my idea
 Jeker#3389: why do you have a try-catch in your code with no exepctions?
 BadPiggy#5202: F
 BadPiggy#5202: When I look back at all my games , there's like only 1 original concept lol
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: personally i keep a blog where i put my thoughts on other games and record my progress making games... it's empty right now because i got embarassed about my previous posts lmao
 Yollie#2239: yeah..... probably
 Pixstatic#3464: well you do know there's a theme right?
 Yollie#2239: aside from the originality issue your games are pretty good
 Pixstatic#3464: mine got prettier and less buggy but I still never finish them lol
 caibi#2508: maybe it’s too difficult to make it in the jam
 Pixstatic#3464: devlogs are a very good motivator to keep yourself accountable, highly recommend even if you don't really want people to watch/read them
 BadPiggy#5202: Everyone's first game sucks lol.
My current games suck as well, so don't worry
 Yollie#2239: nah you still cant beat a skilled pyro unfortunately, or maybe im not good enough at demoknight
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: 👍
 Pixstatic#3464: so was my first you gotta start somewhere
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Oki, but its terrible jsut saying ._.
 Jeker#3389: i am pretty sure max head demo can counter anything
 caibi#2508: The main idea of my game is a airship crashed into a random generated planet, player need to collect and craft things, gameplay is like *Subnautica*
 Yollie#2239: i mean i dont think you should post it in any of the gmtk jam channels but feel free to post them in the patron channels
 Pixstatic#3464: I'll watch it if you put it here, I'm intrigued already and I know literally nothing about it
 Pixstatic#3464: I mean I doubt anyone is going to stop you
 Yollie#2239: also that 5 heads on eyelander 👌
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Someone here gave me the idea on it
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: a different game lmao
 Jeker#3389: you have a point
 Yollie#2239: uhhh the jam hasnt started yet are you a time traveller
 Jeker#3389: trueeee
 Jeker#3389: oh, yeah lol
 Pixstatic#3464: ||when zero used the gun to kill that dude it felt so cool and not at all like a joke||
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Guys I made a short devlog on my game, can I put it here to get feedback? Its my first time trying this
 Pixstatic#3464: kz spoilers but ||you get a gun in katana zero, don't you remember?||
 Yollie#2239: yeah true, but still cmon nobody in the world doesnt want to cosplay as a drunk scottish warrior with a haunted axe
 Jeker#3389: Oh, nice I would describe my game as: Katana Zero, but guns lol
 Jeker#3389: demoknight is kinda situational tho, and can be heavy countered by pyro
 Pixstatic#3464: funnily enough I am also making a game that draws inspiration from elements of katana zero, moreso in story tho
 Yollie#2239: *that i remember and i also have talked to on that server before
 Yollie#2239: more games should really embrace the high risk high reward payoff of demoknight tf2, like straight up charging into an enemy's face and whacking them with a golf club just feels 👌
 DrNukeLear#2414: Aren't you on the Wayfarer Games discord?
 JuliusCube#8501: just get not a vibing cat to join or something
 Jeker#3389: nah the game's not for the jam
 Pixstatic#3464: I do not mean to discredit victims of the ukraine war, but have you heard of the cromag war? that stuff's sick
 Murten#0001: Katana one
 Yollie#2239: if i can find someone i know from somewhere else
 BadPiggy#5202: I mean the focus of combat in these games isn't like DOOM where in-your-face combat is the norm
 DrNukeLear#2414: Lets hope the theme isn't: "The opposite of katana zero"
 Yollie#2239: ive never played or seen any valorant before but im betting it also has pretty decent melee mechanics considering how much it looks like overwatch
 Jeker#3389: I am actually making a game heavily inspired by katana zero and hotline miami lol
 Yollie#2239: i seriously cant think of competitive fps games which get melee feeling good aside from tf2 and like overwatch i guess
 JuliusCube#8501: yollie when are you gonna remove that o in your name
 Jeker#3389: Ok, look I know i am meant not to be political, but FACTS
 GodOfPro#7302: i mean using a melee in a fps game is a easy to get destroyed
 BadPiggy#5202: I get ya.
You want some weight behind the blows
 Pixstatic#3464: man if there's one reason I hate putin it's because he delayed the katana zero dlc /s /srs /j
 Yollie#2239: but just a tiny knife and a dumb slow stab in like csgo or something doesnt feel nice at all
 BadPiggy#5202: Ah yes. Ghost runner too lol
 Yollie#2239: Im not talking about focusing on the melee mechanics, just the option of stabbing things releases dopamine and also makes me motion sick which isnt cool but ehhhh
 Joe Mcdermott#9590: Ghostrunner, also.
 Jeker#3389: fuck yes it does, still waitting for the dlc lol
 Pixstatic#3464: I've been programming for nearly a decade it was a joke lolll (I had "Programmer" in my nickname but removed it in favour of pronouns and then forgot)
also katana zero *RULES* and I *WILL* talk about it
 BadPiggy#5202: But fr though, there really aren't too many games that focus on FPS melee mechanics now-a-days
The only recent games I can think of are Shady knight and the dying light series lol
Oh wait, chivalry as well
 Jeker#3389: First of all, Katana zero fan? Second of all, its not as hard as you may think
 DrNukeLear#2414: If only I could send images 😉
 Murten#0001: When you react to the wrong message. 😢
 Astral#7476: Oh, thats lovley to hear 🙂
 Pixstatic#3464: so relatable
 theChief#0001: oops, wrong reply 😂
 Yollie#2239: saying hello in the superhot style
nah jk but yes superhot style
 DrNukeLear#2414: Pretty good ta!
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: hours of mindnumbing practice until you have a pavlovian response to your console telling you that you missed a semicolon or a curly bracket
 Enginak#4100: Is there any prize for the winner?
 Astral#7476: I am good, thank you for asking! You?
 DrNukeLear#2414: Hello! How are you?
 Yollie#2239: Ok guys you know what i absolutely love? good melee mechanics in fps games
what i love more? if you can throw that melee weapon and do some cool stuff with it being a projectile
 Pixstatic#3464: programming rules I wish I knew how to do that stuff man
 Astral#7476: Hi!
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: right, as i was saying, i'm watching a freecodecamp.org video on dynamic programming, this is awesome. i love programming so much
 BadPiggy#5202: Now then
Back to video gaems
 Merus#7019: but anyway, move on
 Merus#7019: like they could have least gone for the pun
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Alright, let's - for the second time - try to move on
 Yollie#2239: man with an entire excavator
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i love the mispelling of the word "masculanity" btw it's so fucking funny
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Move on, its been dealt with
 Murten#0001: I think its the " 💪 Stop acting gay. Embrace masculanity" (which is spelled masculinity btw).
 BadPiggy#5202: Oof
 Phallo#3476: this guy be dual wielding shovels
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: You can have any pronouns you want. You can't tell people to "stop acting gay" in this channel. You have a full hour to read the rules and try again Bye
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: your bio is quite literally "stop being gay, embrace muscalinity"
 theChief#0001: it's your status text, not your nickname, that there is an issue with.
 BadPiggy#5202: Digging your own grave be like .......
 Frog Musk#4593: but I am not homophobic who said that I just precised my own pronouns wich is normal
 DrNukeLear#2414: Too many "O"'s in "prove"?
 Murten#0001: prove*
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: well, for one, you conflated homophobic remarks with the entire grammatical concept of pronouns, so,
 Frog Musk#4593: could you proove it you don't even know me
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I wasn't complaining about your pronouns, I was asking you to respect the rules of the channel
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Ain't about pronouns buddy - I think we've made it clear - the status is fairly obviously homophobic, change it or you don't have to stick around if you don't want to follow the rules
 BadPiggy#5202: Hahaha lol
That prototype was something else
I haven't thought of it in a long time
 Murten#0001: +1
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: awesome, can we ban this clown?
 Yollie#2239: You should revisit that baseball bat fps game you made, that was pretty cool
 Frog Musk#4593: bruh I have the right to choose my pronouns as yours so yeah..........(and I respect them)
 Murten#0001: Putting roads underground will fix traffic. 👍
 BadPiggy#5202: Yo Adam.
I only now recognised your logo and just wanted to say that your videos are pog
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: in other news, i'm learning about memoization. awesome programming concept. loving dynamic programming so far
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Yeah for the record whilst we can't and won't (for a variety of reasons) check *everyone's* bios, if you've got stuff that's blatantly not cool in there and it's making people uncomfortable, you gotta change that shit
 DrNukeLear#2414: Very true
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: When mods address something its not smart to linger on it
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: alright its been dealt with, we;re all good. Move on
 DrNukeLear#2414: Oh Elon Musk is smart alright... I just don't agree with his world views 😉
 Murten#0001: He likes Elon Musk. He's probably not very smart.
 BadPiggy#5202: Oof.
 DrNukeLear#2414: Well spotted
 BadPiggy#5202: Yeah lol
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Can you change your homophobic status please
 Yollie#2239: red handed?
 Yollie#2239: hes pretty cool
 Pixstatic#3464: love that game
 Pixstatic#3464: I got up at 3 in the morning for will you snail and it was 100% worth it
 BadPiggy#5202: My most played game was from the last wowie jam. Time to make a sequel kek
 Frog Musk#4593: oh cool thx man appreciate it
 Pixstatic#3464: jonas my beloved and beworshipped
 Yollie#2239: oof. I will recommend you wowie jam which is in a few months as a replacement
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: mods, should this be allowed?
 Frog Musk#4593: yea but like in the period of the gamejam I'll have to go visit like someone in the countryside
where there is no internet nor electrecity ;-;
 Pixstatic#3464: it’s both, suckers!!
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: uh... cool status
 Pixstatic#3464: rick catsley
 Yollie#2239: Schrodinger's cat_hug ; is it an actual cute emote of a cat or is it a rickroll
 Yollie#2239: cant you just use a downloadable engine?
 Pixstatic#3464: you kept this power from me all this time, you better be ready for :cat_hug:!!!
 Frog Musk#4593: bruh I am sad cuz i wanted to compete but because of internet problems I can't
and good luck to all participants 😉 i hope to you the best experience
 Phallo#3476: i barely know how to communicate in here... reactions are 90% of all of my communication skills
 Yollie#2239: passively aggressively respond with custom emojis everywhere without spamming
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: once i get a game out and have Some income i'll probably pledge to the patron just to have a place to discuss game design concepts
 SlamBamActionman#7160: People have managed with just plain IRC text chat for years, I think you can live with having just our *excellent* selection of Link emojis available
 theChief#0001: suffice to say the server is set up this way for a reason, and complaining about it isn't going to change it 😉
 theChief#0001: yep! For this reason 😛 also what slam said - it gets annoying to have a bunch of "meme" reacts to every post
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: doesn't stop people from, say, spelling out slurs with letter emojis
 Yollie#2239: I want to pet that
 Murten#0001: It's disabled.
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Turns out having a monetary investment makes people behave better
 Pixstatic#3464: yeah they have more to lose so it’s pretty safe I suppose
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: ? if you don't have nitro?
 Murten#0001: You can't use emotes from outside this server though.
 Pixstatic#3464: yeah, no slow mode on that stuff and it’s super easy to bot
 theChief#0001: yep!
 Yollie#2239: wait so do patrons get reaction perms?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: And what chief says above
 theChief#0001: reaction spam is a thing, you can self bot to add swastikas to every single post - which becomes a NIGHTMARE to remove. This __does__ happen, I've had to deal with this specifically in the past.
 SlamBamActionman#7160:  We limit them because it becomes very common for people to add unnecessary reactions as jokes to messages. Like 🇧 🇮 🇬 🇲 🇴 🇩 🇪 and stuff
 Pixstatic#3464: I admit it’s pretty annoying not to have reactions, but it’s on too large of a scale to risk ig
 Yollie#2239: Ooooo my god how did i never know about this
 Murten#0001: How?
 theChief#0001: cool, but they do 😛
 Phallo#3476: i was already thinking of muting the discord during the rush hour because of just how many notifications it is 😛
 Murten#0001: I don't think reaction perms will cause problems. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 Pixstatic#3464: 3700 people who are not patrons currently online, running a self-bot is not exactly hard stuff and there are lots of bad actors on the internet
 theChief#0001: yes 
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: this is just the calm before the storm really
 Yollie#2239: is that a thing in urp?
 theChief#0001: we're also still 3 days away from the jam
 theChief#0001: ahahahahaha just you wait 😂 currently it's the middle of the UK work day, and all of america is still asleep
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: oh it gets very active. just wait for later in the day
 Murten#0001: This chat is not that active though...
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: already today someone was doing react unreact spam
 Pixstatic#3464: this is why I wanted a deferred renderer so bad
 theChief#0001: switch to deferred rendering lol
 Yollie#2239: the only super annoying thing i find with urp is that they only allow 8 lights per object 😭
 Pixstatic#3464: maybe I will switch
 theChief#0001: when you put almost 25,000 people in one place, things get real bad real quick. These simple preventative measures don't really affect you all that much, and immediately ruin any nazi spambot's chances of causing problems
 Pixstatic#3464: I will probably still stick with standard renderer but honestly I write all my own lighting for shaders most of the time and unlit shaders port entirely fine to SRP so it is still entirely stubbornness that keeps me in the default render pipeline
 Murten#0001: Idk why they felt the need to lock this server down this much. It's actually annoying.
 theChief#0001: there you go 😉
 Yollie#2239: I would react to that with a laughing emoji except i dont have reaction perms
 theChief#0001: I... can't say I've ever used deferred rendering with URP - knowing Unity it could be "production ready" in the sense that it's ready to break any game you have in production
 Pixstatic#3464: you awful person you’ve just ruined my entire week… this is what I’m doing for the next 3 days
 Pixstatic#3464: oh man
 theChief#0001: On the master node, you can right click and select "Show Generated Code" and save the output to a regular shader file 🙂
 Pixstatic#3464: wait before I abruptly switch over all my assets to URP… have they got a deferred renderer yet?
 Pixstatic#3464: WHAT
 theChief#0001: you can get the actual underlying code of your shader graph now!
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: heh. pp
 Pixstatic#3464: I use custom PP effects all the time and URP makes that way more annoying
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: there could be a happy middle in the future maybe, creating a shader with shader graph that also gives you access to the underlying code or something that you can jump from to make your specialized shader
 Pixstatic#3464: the main reason I don’t use it is the post processing
 theChief#0001: yeah xD
 Murten#0001: You can still write normal shaders though...
 theChief#0001: ah that's fair
 Pixstatic#3464: you literally don’t have access to the entire shader with shader graph… I may be entirely too obsessed with writing cel shaders tho
 Yollie#2239: urp not only allows you to speedrun cool graphics but it also allows you to make cooler graphics easily
 theChief#0001: or is it shader graph where you sacrifice control? Because you can still write custom functions with SG 😂
 theChief#0001: wait how does URP sacrifice control?
 Yollie#2239: What? why
 theChief#0001: yep, both of them xD
 Pixstatic#3464: I refuse to sacrifice control for convenience
 Yollie#2239: Oh right that one game jam where your teammate ditched you
 Pixstatic#3464: shader graph makes my bones hurt because I hate URP so much
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: woah! this looks awesome!
 Pixstatic#3464: I’m too much of a nerd to accept that it’s even possible to make a videogame without custom post processing effects
 caibi#2508: who created these cute emojis
 theChief#0001: this is what google is for 😉
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i understand that it's just that i never really had the motivation to get into the real nitty-gritty of shaders to like... get an idea of something i want to make happen in my head and translate it into shader code
 Yollie#2239: if you cant do shaders use shader graph (if you use unity)
 theChief#0001: from there you can do a bunch of excellent stuff
 theChief#0001: nah shaders are fine, it's just maths 😁 all you have to remember is that you can treat a colour like a Vector4
 Pixstatic#3464: If my rankings continue on the same trend I’ll be in the top 100 this year lol - went from somewhere in the 2000s to somewhere in the 300s last year
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: shaders are still so scary to me lmao
 caibi#2508: horror game is my second idea now
 Pixstatic#3464: same here, but with game dev you’d be hard pressed not finding new toys to play with anyway. I’ve been writing shaders for years and years and only recently learned how to actually *implement* geometry shaders.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i was the best in class for programming in highschool and people kept asking me how i could like know all of these keywords and stuff while everytime i code i pretty much always have the docs opened at the side for whatever i'm doing
 Clive Dev#0446: he plays the top 100 games I think
 caibi#2508: that means if I get top votes and I made a horror game, I can scared Mark?
 theChief#0001: I've used Unity full time for about 7-8 years and I still jump into a tutorial every now and then when I'm too lazy to figure something out for myself (which is pretty damn often)
 Pixstatic#3464: yeah people confuse the skills of knowing what to tell the computer and knowing how to solve the problem at all
 Pixstatic#3464: I’m sure he plays a handful throughout the review time but he plays all of the top games at the end
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: a good programmer's not someone who can memorize docs it's someonw who can come up with algorithms for most situations and know how to navigate the docs to realize those algorithms
 caibi#2508: will Mark play the game again by heself?
 Pixstatic#3464: I’d like to say I’m past the point of needing tutorials at all but I would be kidding myself if I said I knew the names of all of unity’s stupid bloody namespaces off by heart
 darlingS#1797: Music sensory processing brain go brrrrr
 Pixstatic#3464: it’s also just nice sometimes to skip straight to a really well-commented chunk of code and learn by deciphering that and figuring out how to implement it into my own frankenstein project
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: power of modularity - you can do something like creating a generic hurtbox object and hitbox object that sends a signal whenever it overlaps with a hurtbox/hitbox and then listeners can deal with the result of an overlap
 darlingS#1797: Imagine learning coding by actually coding. I just downloaded a few engines and have failed to maintain constant focus
 Pixstatic#3464: I find tutorial videos insufferable but programming tutorial blogs (*when done well*) are awesome learning tools
 BadPiggy#5202: Me when I first learnt Unity kek
 Pixstatic#3464: video tutorials are overrated, people should write more blogs
 Pixstatic#3464: I am too proud and have too short of an attention span for tutorials at this point but for whatever reason I couldn’t learn godot through documentation alone
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: I have a little sunk cost in unity because i’ve been using it for years
 BadPiggy#5202: I'ma switch only if I'll be able to do my usual 2.5D approach in Godot. I can't go back to 2D now lol
 Pixstatic#3464: godot’s 3D support is pretty awesome (*for specific things), but I found godot’s programming language very jarring
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I enjoy godot
 BadPiggy#5202: Lol
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: i’m thinking of switching to godot after seeing our programmer make a roguelike in 48 hours
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: the 3d is fine, but it still needs some work to be fully realized i feel. look forward to godot 4, i'm hearing a LOT of good things
 BadPiggy#5202: Or rather, how's Godots' 3D support looking now ?
 Pixstatic#3464: unity is objectively super bloated imo, it’s why I lament the issues with gamemaker
 BadPiggy#5202: How's Godot for 2.5D ?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: personally godot was that for me - unity still felt a bit bloated, and godot is a very modular and light weight engine, the hierarchical paradigm it uses for everything is very very very powerful too
 Pixstatic#3464: I mean I used it for like 2 straight years but it has some serious bottlenecks and for a lot of that I felt trapped because of my initial bad experience with unity
 BadPiggy#5202: I think I once tried the OG version of gamemaker lol.
I was much younger and didn't even know what I was doing
 Pixstatic#3464: I feel like I outgrew it way quicker than I should have tho
 Pixstatic#3464: yeah unity was a big jump for me from much less bloated programming environments so I kinda learned the basics of interfacing with a game engine in gamemaker
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: a good mid place between a beefier engine and learning engines, allowing people just starting out to actually make fully realized games
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: it's also a great learning tool!
 Pixstatic#3464: yeah exactly. gamemaker is a great prototyping tool because for a lot of things it is like ridiculously fast to work in, but in large projects you end up kinda held back by the limited editor and a lack of good built in tools for specific tasks. The room editor itself is so lacking in features it hurts.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I enjoyed the open chats a few years ago they were good fun but they were super difficult There won't be any public voice chats. You will see people making discord servers to offer feedbacka nd stuff though
 Pixstatic#3464: opening up a vc or two with a limited number of slots during the jam period and review time would be nice
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: and when you're working in the long run, you need to create the structures needed to make development easy to deal with over the long term - can't just place prefabs from the file manager over and over to make levels
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: vc is very hard to moderate and it actually loses usablity at a certain point if too many people are in it so they made it patron only
 Pixstatic#3464: … I’m coping by using a game engine that has the features I want…
It just makes me sad because gamemaker is an excellent little program with giant gaping drawbacks for not much reason
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: learning what is appropriate in what scale is a skill in game dev too - when you prototype you can't spend too much time with advanced optimized techniques and stuff, you just gotta get a playable concept out
 Pixstatic#3464: I have a horrific habit of going unnecessarily over the top on tiny things tho so maybe it isn’t a big deal
 caibi#2508: why can’t have a vc that include rules to make it not that **chaos**
 null_ham#2050: cope
 Pixstatic#3464: unity lets you write scripts to customise the way that the unity editor works… gamemaker’s editor is convoluted and restrictive and people like me like to add features to games that are totally impractical to work with without being able to customise the engine to an extent
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: no, look at what I just said
 caibi#2508: is there a vc for everyone?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: they had one a few years ago and it was chaos so now its patreon only
 caibi#2508: so sad
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: me + voice chat + dslr with monitor output over usb + fancy lenses + some very good cats
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: dear god i cannot imagine a voice call open to everyone
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: so yes
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: its in the vc
 caibi#2508: I guess it’s Patrons only, right?
 null_ham#2050: wdym
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: do you see the picture of a cat? Its that, but live
 Pixstatic#3464: camera with cat visible
 caibi#2508: what is CatCam?
 Pixstatic#3464: I’ll go back to gamemaker when they add some proper ways to customise the tools a little honestly
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: disclaimer; catcam may descend into chaos as i now attempt to eat a sandwich
 Pixstatic#3464: ah well I’m not totally up to date.. still not happy about switching to a subscription model but whateverrr
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: giving the patrons an unfair psychological advantage... the tyranny of not giving cat cam to the people!!
 null_ham#2050: they literally stopped that
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: cat cam happens while the jam is on so basically then next couple fo weeks
 null_ham#2050: no
 Pixstatic#3464: no I know I’ve just seen how they’re trickling in tiny little features only available to subscribers and I know that the way they’ll probably proceed is by adding bigger and bigger features until everyone is paying them a monthly fee
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i mean i was sold when i realized this could be a place where i could discuss interesting design concepts but now that i know there's a cat cam...
 Pixstatic#3464: this is the single best ad for the gmtk patreon I’ve ever seen
 null_ham#2050: you dont have to buy a subscription if you already bought it before
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: cat cam in on in the vc if any patrons are around
 Pixstatic#3464: I’m kidding I left gamemaker behind a while before they were acquired…
still makes me a little sad that they’re essentially pushing people to make crappy browser games
 GameSkull#4559: same
 null_ham#2050: what?
 Pixstatic#3464: that looks really cool, shame they’re slowly screwing over their old userbase who paid full price upfront for their software
 HFK#9999: hello
 HFK#9999: Also ive never been in a game jame so this'll be my first one pog ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯
 Redline#7370: hello
 HFK#9999: Hey im new here :)
 GameSkull#4559: yo yo yo
 R2D2Vader#0693: I activated a free trial of the mid tier to export to web for this game jam... gotta remember to cancel the subscription next year when the trial runs out 👀
 DrNukeLear#2414: I agree 100%
 R2D2Vader#0693: XD fair
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: well i bought it to but i'll still complain cause subscription models are vile
 R2D2Vader#0693: i paid for the perpetual desktop export license when that was a thing so i can't really complain about the subscription model lol ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 R2D2Vader#0693: also, it'd be cool if they let you web export for free, rather than locking it to gx.games
 R2D2Vader#0693: yeah wish the cool stuff would come out for everyone 😔
 BadPiggy#5202: Oink
 ihapiece#4673: weow
 null_ham#2050: yeah theyve become a whole lot more open about what theyre doing next and want feedback from users
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: one thing i really like about how yoyo is operating now is that they're having fully realized videos about the roadmap discussing what to do next with the engine. i'm a godot gal but i have a lot of respect for my game maker friends
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: it's definitely a step in the right direction
 null_ham#2050: theres still all the low level networking stuff that makes me cry but rollback is only for opera gx since they do all the networking with their servers
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: ahh
 null_ham#2050: but its only for opera gx
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: YO??? catch me making a fighting game in game maker next, for REAL
 BadPiggy#5202: Well I may end up switching to Godot one fine day, but until then, Unity serves me well
 null_ham#2050: yeah they added rollback networking in the latest beta
 Zoro5168#0115: Yo
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: oh yeah opera bought yoyo and they're doing game maker a lot of good. they're making the engine a lot less archaic imo
 BadPiggy#5202: I was wondering why that operagx jam demanded only gamemaker lol
 null_ham#2050: yeah you use gamemaker to publish to opera gx
 BadPiggy#5202: Wait they bought yoyo ? Damn
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i don't think undertale was studio 2, studio 2 released around 2017 i believe, and undertale released in 2014
 null_ham#2050: gamemaker is also getting a lot of new features now that opera bought out yoyogames
 BadPiggy#5202: Oh. Cool then
 null_ham#2050: undertale was studio 2
 BadPiggy#5202: I remember Disc room was with 1.4
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: nah, i don't think so - hotline miami 2 i Think was studio 2?
 null_ham#2050: no
 BadPiggy#5202: I think almost all commercial game maker games were made with 1.4 ? XD
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: sometimes the logo shows in big triple A titles (hello, Atlus)
 theChief#0001: it's because the logo is displayed when you _don't_ pay, and isn't displayed when you do
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: hyperlight was made in *game maker*, and not even studio 2 - i think it was studio 1.4.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yeah unity gained a bad rep for asset flips for a long time
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: engine's just an engine
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Hahahaha
 BadPiggy#5202: I even remember one of the steam reviews for FURi being
" I'm not allowed to make fun of the Unity engine ever again after this "
 BadPiggy#5202: The trailer where they show the fight with the burst is art lol
I think it was a playstation trailer
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: there's an art to making good trailers. honestly i can't wait to have my hand at it
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Expertly cut, I just love it
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Good ass trailer
 BadPiggy#5202: Word of warning though, it is a very hardcore action game lol
You'll either learn the combat and it's nuances and end up loving the game....
Or you'll drop it hard lol
 theChief#0001: yeah I really should play furi huh
 BadPiggy#5202: FURi is basically top 10 anime fights the game
And I'm all for it
 SlamBamActionman#7160: It makes you *feel* like when you play FURI
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: yeah, sekiro doesn't give you a choice but to play with what in other fromsoft games was a dex toolkit with added bonuses
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Most accurate trailer of a game I have seen
 SlamBamActionman#7160: FURI is bae
 BadPiggy#5202: They design everything around those tools
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: right, so what do you think sekiro and FURI do to achieve that?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: what does undertale do with its conflict? it establishes that choices you take have permanent consequences. what does dark souls do with its conflict? push you to get better, either with better tools, or mastering your current tools
 BadPiggy#5202: Ah got ya.
I myself kinda prefer the style of something like Sekiro or FURi i.e the actual conflict is designed around mastering the tools you're given from beginning to end
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: basically it's about establishing a set of implied rules for the conflicts through the mechanics and systems that the game is made out of, yeah. after the toriel fight, you (spoiling because even though it's 2022, there might still be people who haven't played undertale) ||realize that you should be more careful with what you do, and that violence perhaps isn't the answer, which may lead you to want to try again - reloading the save and stuff, leading you to learn there's meta stuff going on||. and for dark souls, you establish a dynamic where you have your players learn that to make progress (get through the conflict) they have 2 ways to go about it: master their current tools, which can be difficult, or find new appropriate tools for the situation you're in. for example if you're in the catacombs and you've been using an occult weapon so far, you could either > get better so that the fact you're not using an ideal weapon doesn't matter, or > go back to firelink and to andre, and get a weapon with a divine upgrade to deal with skeletons without having to focus so much on the necromancers
 BadPiggy#5202: So you're referring to establishing a conflict through the workings of the mechanics and structures themselves ?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: ultimately this is one of many frameworks you can use to design your game and probably not the sole one you should use, because it does have its problems
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: if you're making a game like dark souls, you probably make your design be focused on giving very little tools for the player to actually make progress easily, because the conflict is being in a world that's geared towards making your life hell, which makes the design tuned towards having the player really work to progress. if you're making a game like undertale, where the design itself is made to obfuscated the right choice at least early on, you're not going to give the players too many hints on what's right and maybe employ unreliable tutorials to have the "toriel effect"
 BadPiggy#5202: Not talking about strategy games. I'm all for having peaceful solutions there.
Referring to real-time action games
 BadPiggy#5202: Isn't that something which most action games establish at the start of a fight ?
 ICE_ZERO#4271: My first game jams \]
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: it's useful to define what the central conflict itself is also, because having a clear idea of what the conflict you're designing *for* can help you tune your design decisions towards that
 BadPiggy#5202: Idk if it's just me, but I'm more of an action fan and don't really like it when dialogue becomes part of combat tbh lol
If it's something like a stealth game then okay. But in action game, nah
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: A big element of the discussion is "what is conflict?" - does struggling against the rules of a survival game count as conflict?
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: It's not far off the concept of 'narratives require drama' (which obviously isn't always true, but many many stories will require some form of conflict to drive the story and characters)
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: that's also interesting because in a way, that's *still* conflict! the only thing that changes is the way you resolve it - which is itself an interesting idea
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: A couple of my favourite 'combat' games are such because they've found a way to make non-violent (read: dialogue) combat a thing
 Tornado#0975: Back
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: there's actually some interesting discussion on the concept that something games "inherently" have is a conflict of some kind, which i think applies to a lot of games but not *every* game. in minecraft creative mode there's no real conflict. in farming sim games there's no conflict. but the idea of designing things while avoiding conflict i think can be an interesting way to go about things
 Phallo#3476: "a good game must have fight" I will fight you on that
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: So frustrating
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: My fiancee's laptop has that issue, I absolutely hate it
 Phallo#3476: biggest issue i have with the keyboard is the smaller shift on the right... i constantly hit the up arrow instead of the shift key
 Phallo#3476: haha no worries, the link i sent is my exact variant 🙂
 caibi#2508: make a game that called press button, press button 500,000,000 times and win
 Phallo#3476: default that came with it... ones in the pic
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: Ooh nice, what keycaps do you have with it?
 Phallo#3476: smaller keyboard
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: Mac, smaller keyboard, or secret third option?
 Phallo#3476: step one failed... keyboard does not have a right alt key 😛
 dsb#2296: With your right hand: place your thumb on right-alt, then pretend you are using 'wasd' with your 3 middle fingers. Assuming your pinkie can rest on any nearby key: which is comfier 1 or 2?
w  a  s  d
1) p   l   ;   '
2) [   ;   '   \
*if  \  is above your enter key, use enter instead.
 BadPiggy#5202: Same.
Mostly cus my computer can't take more lol
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: I'm of the less is best philosophy personally
 BadPiggy#5202: Hue changes, camera positioning and angles, screenshake
Can make any game beautiful
 Redline#7370: just saying HDRIs are skyboxes or cubemaps
 BadPiggy#5202: Which is why I just focus on the camera for visuals kek
 caibi#2508: me 2
 BadPiggy#5202: I can't even run the editor for Unity using a post processing render pipeline lol
Sans post processing ftw
 caibi#2508: hmm, HDRI is good too(
 Redline#7370: I'm a HDRP enjoyer, destroyer of graphics cards
 caibi#2508: lmao(
 Redline#7370: *HDRP*
 caibi#2508: URP or ~~HDRI~~ *HDRI*
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: I think Sam meant more talking with their team about what genres everyone is comfortable working with
 caibi#2508: oh yes Trello
 caibi#2508: ||and then when the theme release you realise that these ideas is totally not useful||
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: but that was a seven day jam, and producing content was a drop in the bucket compared to making mechanics and enemies and stuff
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: my old game jam game stretched to maybe 10-20 minutes
 unityAccount#7810: It's very helpful and doesn't take too long to check
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: I still need to check platformers toolkit myself though, I've been meaning to for a long time
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: oh yeah duh I'm. in the place of the community that made a useful tool to study these things lmao
 caibi#2508: bruh
 caibi#2508: stop pressing the reaction button
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: these are small things that'll make your platformer a lot better than the very basic idea for a platformer
 theChief#0001: after around 2-3 mins of play time, people drop out pretty quickly. I might actually add some analytics to this jam game so I can see how long people are playing for, so I can put hard numbers to the general vibe I get from having done so many jams 😂
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: this is a cue for anyone who doesn't know these things to research input buffers, coyote time, and considering whether using rounded collision boxes is a good idea btw!
 Redline#7370: my friends were destroying their tables, but they kept coming back to the game so I guess it's fine
 Redline#7370: *5 minutes if speedrunning it, otherwise it takes over an hour to beat due to sheer difficulty and lack of playtesting*
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: making a platformers gonna require a bunch of refining and knowledge of tricks to. make the game feel good from the get go
 theChief#0001: 5 minutes is pretty much the perfect length for a jam game! But yes that sounds like quite a lot, probably don't do that 😉
 Basky#7894: ok thanks
 Redline#7370: hmm yeah, but in my last jam I made a story based game, with undertale battle system, and it was a platformer, and it's like 5 minutes long, but the platforming sucked and I made it **in 3 days**
 unityAccount#7810: Friday
 Murten#0001: And then after 1 hour of development my monkey brain takes over and starts adding anything shiny that comes to mind.
 Basky#7894: mine at 8 pm from what ik but idk what day
 GodOfPro#7302: just check the itch page it will tell you when it is with your pc timezone
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: check the itch page, it's going to have a timer and several timezones listed with a time
 Basky#7894: like the day
 GodOfPro#7302: mine starts in 9:30 pm
 Basky#7894: GMT + 3
 GodOfPro#7302: idk your timezone
 Basky#7894: ok so on 15?
 Basky#7894: sure
 Phallo#3476: my default sleep is like 3 hours 4 times a day... send help
 GodOfPro#7302: 2 days and 8 hours and 25 minutes
 caibi#2508: no funny joke: ~~jam is like only fast food challenge lmao~~
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: mornin' 👋
 Murten#0001: Next week.
 Basky#7894: when is the game jam starting?
 GodOfPro#7302: my default sleep time is 8 - 10 hours lol
 Redline#7370: I'll try to not overscope like what I've done on my last jam, but the 13-14 hours does include eating and drinking, with around 7-8 hours of sleep, that I'm fine with
 Dave_BBX#4939: Same
 Oderix#4468: so, that's how it works... Okay, at least I know it before it started) Thanks)
 Murten#0001: My brain doesn't function to begin with so why bother sleeping.
 caibi#2508: I still need to do my homework at Saturday
 theChief#0001: ah that'll be the end of the voting period! Itch is weird with embeds
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: I think I'll end up doing 24 hours total as usual because I like sleep
 Oderix#4468: don't know why, but my saved link in Telegram still shows it like *A game jam from 2022-07-15 to 2022-07-22 hosted by Game Maker's Toolkit.*
 caibi#2508: I may only have 12h on it, sigh.
 theChief#0001: you'll make a better game for scoping small, sleeping lots, going outside and eating/drinking well!
 Redline#7370: I'm doing the casual 13-14 hours a day, like I usually do at jams
 theChief#0001: scope to however much time you have available, I'm going to be spending 8-10 hours both days on it, so maybe 20h total at a push
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: Can confirm did that for a expo once do not recommend
 theChief#0001: do not work for 48 hours straight _please_ 
 caibi#2508: Mark always scared me when he suddenly send a message
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: Should it be treated as a 48 hour jam or a 24 hour jam with lots of breaks
 Redline#7370: I'm doing it solo? never said I'm in a team
 theChief#0001: ... damn, it has been six years already?
 ADEEL#5105:  hows your team?
 Mark Brown#6982: For six years 😂
 theChief#0001: no, it's a 2 day jam and always has been 🙂
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: No it's always been two days
 Murten#0001: Yeah, you joined the VC right after I said they were alone.
 caibi#2508: where is the VC channel????
 Oderix#4468: ayo, wasn't jam supposed to last 7 days? I can see that it only lasts 2 days...
 Redline#7370: I can confirm that I can't see it
 Merus#7019: look again, kid
 theChief#0001: it's visible to everyone but not join-able to everyone I think
 Murten#0001: I ate my carrots. I have good eyes.
 caibi#2508: voice chat
 Merus#7019: how can you see it....
 ADEEL#5105: Vice city?
 Murten#0001: The VC that you can't see.
 DrNukeLear#2414: Sounds a bit extreme for running out of a sandwich filling.
 unityAccount#7810: VC where?
 MrBen#0001: man_breaking_a_neck
 Murten#0001: Walrusware chilling in vc all by their lonesome. :(
 MrBen#0001: 💆
 theChief#0001: but then, most of my game art is simple shapes so you might not be able to do that with code - e.g. pixel art would struggle with procedural animation
 theChief#0001: for idles I just jiggle things about a bit, it works best if you've got at least two separate things you can jiggle at different times
 caibi#2508: mod helpers will disappear from the world after the jam — Mark Brown
 ConstantDerivative#6302: hello everyone
 Oderix#4468: do you know how to make random idle animations without relying on variables?
 Merus#7019: and why it's described as a "novelty clock" on the customs statement
 Merus#7019: was wondering why I was suddenly getting physical "Patreon" rewards
 Murten#0001: Based.
 theChief#0001: 
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: Mark rn:
 Mark Brown#6982: Demoted!! Demoted
 AEIOU#0652: mod helper -1
 Mark Brown#6982: The mod helpers will be killed when the jam is over
 theChief#0001: mod helpers are the most helpful people in the world, we outrank mods and even outrank mark himself. We own this server, and everyone in it ❤️
for real though, the mod helpers are just here to help with the server while it's public - we're here to make sure things don't get terrible. The mods actually _run_ the server
 DrNukeLear#2414: One helps the other?
 theChief#0001: not _omnipresent_, just terminally online 😉
 theChief#0001: when I say I get the computer to do it I mean I mostly use DOTween and procedural animation 😅 I don't have any actual animation files
 caibi#2508: nono, i haven’t watch it, how can i spoiler
 DrNukeLear#2414: Not yet, spoiler tags pls.
 caibi#2508: did you guys watched *Thor: Love and Thunder*?
 DrNukeLear#2414: I can recommend using the Unity Animator for more complex animations and then using an animation action to trigger code.
 MrBen#0001: hey how you doing
 theChief#0001: I noticed both of them and appreciate them
 DrNukeLear#2414: ... bold claim. Got it. I’ll see myself out.
 DrNukeLear#2414: Oh come on, it was a font pun.
 tykenn#8548: yeah, calling him that was a bold claim
 Merus#7019: he's just really good
 Merus#7019: theChief's not omniscent
 DrNukeLear#2414: I thought you were the font of all knowledge.
 theChief#0001: I'm lazy and only really know maths and code, so if I can get the computer to do it for me I will
 Tornado#0975: right
 Tornado#0975: also how do yall make animations like frame based or code
 theChief#0001: damn there are a lot of good typography puns huh?
 theChief#0001: okay that's incredible
 tykenn#8548: Good idea. I'll try to play with that too. But like for example, if I'm calling angels "serifim", I can't *not* give them a serif font
 theChief#0001: character spacing would also be good, you could do a really chilled out character with  w i d e  c h a r a c t e r  s p a c i n g  to make it feel like what they're saying is taking longer
 theChief#0001: ah that's fair. Personally, I'd inject personality with colour, font weight, and animation rather than different fonts entirely - but I can see how that could work
 Oderix#4468: thanks a lot!
 theChief#0001: mark might do something similar, or he might have something a little different up his sleeve. Nobody but mark knows 🙂
 caibi#2508: game theme release on Friday, it’s simple and alot space to work on
 tykenn#8548: I was thinking more about special fonts for certain characters (like in Undertale). So rules are a little different, but I probably shouldn't go overboard and give *every* character their own font.
 theChief#0001: we can only go on past themes!
**2017**
Theme: Dual Purpose Design
**2018**
Theme: Genre without Mechanic
**2019**
Theme: Only One
**2020**
Theme: Out of Control
**2021**
Theme: Joined Together
 Oderix#4468: hi everyone! This is my first GMTK jam. Could someone explain how restrictive jam theme is? I thought maybe I should prepare something if it is possible to not spend time on them.
 theChief#0001: there will be a few people who haven't set one up yet I guess - but you **__will__** need one to submit your game to the jam
 theChief#0001: yeah this is reasonable. I might do a second pass at it shortly 🙂
 Phallo#3476: the game reminds me of beat hazard and that game has A LOT of "oh no my eyes!!"
 caibi#2508: ~ hmmm, is someone here don’t have a itch.io account? ~[deleted stupid question]
 theChief#0001: you want two - one headline font and one body font. I will also allow one subtitle font if necessary 😉
 tykenn#8548: Since I'm making a game that uses typography puns for worldbuilding, I should probably look into more fonts. But then at the same time, too many fonts is generally a bad idea.
 Phallo#3476: personally text should always be left aligned... the text containing box itself is allowed to be center aligned though
 SquidGeneral10#4090: It might just be that third gif, but i'm fairly certain your game would give me a headache. 😆
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: That is beautiful omg
 BadPiggy#5202: Ah yes. One of the best games of the prev jams
 SquidGeneral10#4090: Geegaz had like 2 years to make this look fancier but it's gorgeous
 GodOfPro#7302: Does anyone have some good itch pages for the previous jams i can use for reference for my page
 theChief#0001: you're wrong, the best font is Lemon Milk
 Zayn#4390: Segoe UI Variable is The best font tbh
 SquidGeneral10#4090: agreed
 Phallo#3476: the font read me like a book
 theChief#0001: and all the default itch pixel font says is "I couldn't be bothered to find a good font, and my game uses pixel art"
 BadPiggy#5202: Hmm.... Alright, I'll take your word for it
 Merus#7019: hey theChief, these are all on itch
 theChief#0001: look at how much _variety_ is there!
 Merus#7019: oh there they are
 theChief#0001: this is not a subjective opinion 😉 it's objective truth
 Merus#7019: someone made a bunch of really nice pixel fonts and I've seen them linked a few times
 BadPiggy#5202: Same
 Phallo#3476: sounds just like me... no wonder i like it
 BadPiggy#5202: You saying pixel art doesn't have personality 👀
Jk
 theChief#0001: there are SO MANY better fonts out there
 theChief#0001: it's a really really bad font. It's unreadable and has literally zero personality
 BadPiggy#5202: Really ? I love that font lol
 theChief#0001: you shouldn't, it's bad 😉
 Tornado#0975: Is Having A Good Name For The Game Will Help?
 theChief#0001: oh and a font - don't use the itch pixel font 
 BadPiggy#5202: But hey I mean, if you can get creative and you have time then go ahead lol
 BadPiggy#5202: Just use a colour scheme which matches your game for the page. That's more than enough
 theChief#0001: the cover image and short description are much more important 🙂
 Phallo#3476: personally for my itch page i will prolly just throw something quick together that looks decent using the assets the artist created
 GodOfPro#7302: Idk i will have the time to do a theme unless i can do it before
 BadPiggy#5202: No but it definitely affects first impressions
 GodOfPro#7302: Also is having a pretty theme for the itch page going to effect how many people will play?
 Phallo#3476: lululul
 BadPiggy#5202: Flex
 theChief#0001: don't worry about it being a native build. You can get plenty of players with a download! I've been in the top 5 "most rated" for a jam with a download-only build 😁
 Phallo#3476: local server, unity has one built in... otherwise you can run your own pretty easily
 theChief#0001: in Unity if you "build and run" it spins up a local server for you 🙂 you can also test on itch with a private page
 BadPiggy#5202: A lot of hit Indies may have started from jams,
But keep in mind
Apart from hollow knight, all of those games went viral when they were in the stages of the jam.
That itself was reason enough for the Devs to continue
 Phallo#3476: understandable! im currently make a practice game to see if there will be any major issues with a few of the rough ideas i have and im currently running into one that may make whatever game that is we make for the jam need to be a native build
 Zayn#4390: u dont
 GodOfPro#7302: How do you test the web build before uploading ? when i open the index.html it doesn’t work an d i need to upload it to see if it woks
 Zayn#4390: ye
 Tornado#0975: yup Baba Is You aswell
 Zayn#4390: hmmm u know Hollow Knight, and a few other hit titles were started with a game jam right 😄
 theChief#0001: also if I'm using VFX graph or compute shaders, they aren't supported by WebGL so I can't do it at all xD
 Tornado#0975: I MADE A GAME THEN UNITY WAS DOING STUPID STUFF SO I COULDNT BUILD IT AND THE TIME RAN OUT
 CM69Time#0494:  Thanks!
 Tornado#0975: i remember on my first jam
 theChief#0001:  🙂
 theChief#0001: I press "build", and if I can't find any bugs then I upload it 😛 as soon as I find one, I scrap the web build because they can be a nightmare to find and fix
 CM69Time#0494: What do you guys think?
 Tornado#0975: ofc its easier but ppl wont like it as much i think
 Tornado#0975: i mean. the gam jam games no one will like but if i make a big game it will be polished so ppl will like it more
 Zayn#4390: nope Making smaller games is easier in my opinion
 Phallo#3476: i see that about half of your games are playable in the browser... what makes you decide to choose webgl or native games?
 BadPiggy#5202: I find making smaller games is more fun lol
 Zayn#4390: don't, trust me man it's ***PAIN***
 Tornado#0975: i just make smaller games which arent as fun as making a big game
 BadPiggy#5202: I can't work on a game for more than a week yeesh
 theChief#0001: that's kinda the point of the jam, you have to design around the theme and you don't know it til it starts!
 Zayn#4390: nice nice
 CM69Time#0494: Hey guys. Is there anyway I can join a team? I am a experienced musician and have done national tours in my area. I would love to be able to help out.
 Tornado#0975: i should make a long time game aswell
 BadPiggy#5202: Oof
 Zayn#4390: same bro, my game was meant to be a 2 month project and it ended up being 2 years XD
 theChief#0001: mark chooses the theme and announces it when the jam starts
 Zayn#4390: anyone know what the theme will be ? or how the theme is chosen lmao?
 theChief#0001: honestly, same 😂 it was supposed to be a 3-4 month project, and here I am 18 months later
 Tornado#0975: Friday Night for me
 Zayn#4390: Im dying to make a new game lol, im sick of my main project atp
 Zayn#4390: same bro
 BadPiggy#5202: Just waiting for Friday
 Zayn#4390: how's it going ?
 Zayn#4390: hi
 BadPiggy#5202: Lol. It was at the very end and was locked so I didn't even see XD
 Tornado#0975: nice names!
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: no one can answer that for you. You can always put a post on team finder up and decide not to use it but if you don't put it up then you kind of have less of a choice
 Tornado#0975: can u send the link to youre itch. i wanna see the games you made
 Tornado#0975: yup
 theChief#0001: depends how you want to work. I just use simple shapes and do all the animation through code, so I rarely team up with an artist
 Phallo#3476: i mean... good art usually makes a game feel way better!
 theChief#0001: however, keep in mind that everyone else is also working to a really tight deadline - so you might not be able to get a ton of feedback in _this_ server
 Tornado#0975: should i get a teammate with good art skills or solo
 theChief#0001: of course!
 Tornado#0975: are we allowed to get feedback from other jam members that arent on our team
 Tornado#0975: There should be i wish
 Redline#7370:  I asked the same question btw
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yep
 BadPiggy#5202: Oh btw, question for the mods
Will there be a channel to showcase GIFs or images of the progress in our jam games during the jam period ?
 Tornado#0975: 60000 PKR IS LIKE Even more than house rent of most houses
 Tornado#0975: Yes It Is But 61623 Is SOOO MUCH
 theChief#0001: super worth it IMO, it's one of the few 3D assets that I automatically include in any 3D game I make
 Tornado#0975: 61623 PKR
 Tornado#0975: Oh Well Thats Expensive Lol
 Tornado#0975: ill probably go with 2D this time
 BadPiggy#5202: Probably not
 Tornado#0975: is polyquest free?
 theChief#0001: you can make simple shapes look amazing with a good enough art direction
 Tornado#0975: yeah
 theChief#0001: low poly doesn't look good by default, no - but nothing does 😂
 Tornado#0975: Rightttt
 BadPiggy#5202: Ah crap. I forgot about Ashen lol
 Tornado#0975: Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh
 theChief#0001: it's not a game, it's an asset called "polyquest worlds" on the Unity Asset Store 😛 but it's a good showcase of how low poly can actually look _amazing_
 samcox08#6606: gm.
 caibi#2508: I think that I probably will use 3D URP
 BadPiggy#5202: Nvmd what I meant, I mean that low poly games do look amazing when done right
 Tornado#0975: what is that game? it looks nice its made in URP?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: you don't think Tunic looks good? Fr?
 Tornado#0975: wdym
 BadPiggy#5202: Them's fightin words !!!!
 theChief#0001: they take more time to start with, but once you've got a base you can make a lot of variety very quickly
 cosmicfox#9193: Also it does really depend on your team's comfort zone. Last jam, our artist specialised in 3D but I could not level design with that so we compromised on 2.5D
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I wouldn't make 3D models from scratch for a 2 day jam
 Tornado#0975: + lowpoly 3d doesnt look that nice ngl
 Tornado#0975: 3d Models are a harder to make
 theChief#0001: (so if you're not comfortable with it, it's probably not a great idea for a 48h jam)
 Tornado#0975: 2D I MEANT
 Tornado#0975: Actually I Am Bad At All Arts But A Bit Better At 2D
 cosmicfox#9193: 2D is what I auto go to if I'm having to level design the thing but that's because I also struggle with the spacial navigation. If someone else does 3D I don't care
 theChief#0001: the 3D pipeline _tends_ to frontload a lot of the work, so it takes longer to get started but once you're up and running you can churn out a LOT of stuff very quickly
 Selviam#7268: 2D i believe is easier but it depends on which art form you prefer
 Tornado#0975: Yes. You Are Right!
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: that depends whet you have more experience in and also what tools you are using.
 Tapu#9161: 1D 🥴
 Mark Brown#6982: Whatever you are most comfortable with, and can make in a short time period!
 BadPiggy#5202: 2.5D
 Tornado#0975: What do You Guys Say 2D or 3D? 2D is Quicker To Make So More Polished. 3D Is Well Umm 3D
 cosmicfox#9193: Wholesome!
 Tapu#9161: Is the theme "pants are for losers"?
 Phallo#3476: but ya, for me i wasnt originally going to join the jam but one of my friends told me that it was a dream of his to write music for a video game... and here we are! now im all excited and trying my best to make his music really stand out
 PepperBoi#4544: Yep I meant to say that video is set to premiere
 caibi#2508: …….ok
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: That;s what sets the time limit
 Tapu#9161: Wrong reply 🤦‍♂️
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: The theme is announced when the jam starts, that's the point
 cosmicfox#9193: By conditioning babies with milk
 Tapu#9161: console.println("Agoo gaga")
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: there's some resources you might find useful in the pinned posts if you are new to stuff
 Tornado#0975: because making it 3D will be a bit harder than 2d
 caibi#2508: can anyone send the link of the theme? I can’t find it out
 Phallo#3476: genetic code
 Tornado#0975: hmm i am thinking if i should make the game 2D or 3D when it starts
 RedTeapot#1960: How do you program babies?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: different people have different goals for the jam, but generally speaking if you're learning new things then you're getting somewhere
 caibi#2508: what
 cosmicfox#9193: I am baby programmer so I am whirring with excitement to get back to C# and learn even if I can't accomplish all my tasks. I hope I do but the time limit is extra spicy
 PepperBoi#4544: Yeah I just got exited when I saw it
 cosmicfox#9193: I think my big thing is it doesn't even matter if you finish the jam or not because it's one of those where you need to be proud of what you've done
 hehe boi#3720: Woah everyone is rambling on about the silliest things
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: That's unsurprising, Mark sets it up ready in advance every year
 PepperBoi#4544: I'm dumb lol sorry
 PepperBoi#4544: Yeah thats what I meant
 Tapu#9161: He's mistaken waiting thing
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: good  morning chat
 PepperBoi#4544: I mean its set to be premeired
 Redline#7370: no
 caibi#2508: what?
 Tapu#9161: Wait what
 PepperBoi#4544: There are 46 people watching now lol
 PepperBoi#4544: OMG the theme release video has been premiered
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Alright, enough now. Stop asking if you can use X or Y now.
You have the rules and the faq, that is the same information that we have. It specifically says the mods can't give rulings on edge cases.
Stop asking now thank you. move the conversation on
 Tornado#0975: right
 theChief#0001: Look as mark said in the pinned post, don't make anything specifically for this jam before the jam starts. It's pretty straightforward
 caibi#2508: I think, no, that cheating, auto copilot is fine, but this…. hmm
 Tornado#0975: yes probably
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Read the rules. It tells you all the information. We have the same info as you.
Remember that you don't KNOW what you're going to need until you design the game
 Tapu#9161: Is GitHub copilot allowed? ( AI code writing extension)
 theChief#0001: I think I can say, though, that I have some old character controller code that I haven't changed for the last oh, 50 games I've made that I'll probably be using 😂
 Tornado#0975: right sry
 DrNukeLear#2414: Dear google, can you build me a minecraft clone with stealth elements.
 theChief#0001: We can't give specific advice on whether or not that's breaking the rules
 Tornado#0975: So does this mean i have a character controller script that i use on every project mostly change it up a bit can i use that
 Redline#7370: about the blank unity project, does importing packages count as a blank project?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: when the jam starts, after you know what your game is gong to be you can use the internet to help you
 caibi#2508: stackoverflow, lmao
 Tapu#9161: And stackoverflow?
 Teslobo#8274: Yeah you can reuse generic code like movement no problem
 caibi#2508: that means I can use some basic stuff like movement, thanks.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Using code you have from previous games and projects you made is fine.
If you make models and code  for the jam game before the game starts that is straight up cheating
 DrNukeLear#2414: Runs against the idea of building your game in 48 hours
 caibi#2508: ahhh, sad
 DrNukeLear#2414: Not really if it’s specifically for the jam.
 caibi#2508: I’m coding the simple building system now, prepare models and codes is allowed right?
 caibi#2508: yes, I’m planning for it, I’m writing it on my notebook. It hard to balance, that true. Sometimes you can make a item with less materials and the perfect RNG system is hard to make too.
 Teslobo#8274: Scope creep scope creep
 DrNukeLear#2414: Careful there good collection/crafting games are tricky to balance and time consuming to make.
 caibi#2508: ah, I hate event system, but I have to learn it, it painful to me. I/O is also.
 caibi#2508: I wanna make a game that is high degree of freedom, include buiding system, random generating. you can collect materials and do crafting. If it match the theme
 cosmicfox#9193: With the general game I can understand that, but that was also the first time I'd ever encountered a game that had an accessibility feature I'd needed so I have a soft spot for it. And I haven't even played it.
Essentially we need games to be more accessible for all sorts of learning difficulties and sometimes those accessibility features can directly oppose other people's accessibility features
it'd be neat if when you loaded a game there was a turn on accessibility menu that guided people to their specific needs
 Teslobo#8274: Yeah the wind in that is a neat mechanic. I remember hearing some criticism of it from an accessibility standpoint but I don't remember the specifics
 cosmicfox#9193: It made the game so much more playable whereas with Dark Souls, my partner has to give me all the directions haha
 cosmicfox#9193: Yesssss!
 Teslobo#8274: Ghost of Tsushima?
 cosmicfox#9193: Also I can't remember the PS4 game my partner played but you're a spy in a samurai setting and they have a lovely mechanic where you can get told which direction to head via the spirits giving you guidance, shown by wind blowing in a certain direction.
I love that mechanic. It just clicks for my awful dyspraxic brain that is bad at directions and mapping and feels like an accessibility feature
 cosmicfox#9193: Like literally they have more accessible features built in
 cosmicfox#9193: Elden Ring is way more accessible than the rest of the Dark Souls genre
 Coffe#5594: tho sekiro is probably harder than ER
 Coffe#5594: agree
 voithos#0258: BTW, I would totally recommend Sekiro, even over Elden Ring. It doesn't have the same scope or grandeur as ER, or variety in play style, but the battle system is super unique and fun. It's definitely the "coolest feeling" of their games IMO
 StormyMay#4100: I'm boutta be playing bloodrayne revamped on switch bois no cap
 voithos#0258: It actually runs well AFAIK!
 BadPiggy#5202: Oof
 voithos#0258: Didn't they release DOOM on the Switch? Now that's some impressive optimization
 BadPiggy#5202: I want to get a better computer soon so that I can finally play the recent DOOM games though.
Last time I tried DOOM 2016. It almost killed my computer
 voithos#0258: (Although the article seems to be down now)
 voithos#0258: They are actually pretty badly optimized, lol. I was reading this the other day: http://www.mamoniem.com/behind-the-pretty-frames-elden-ring/
 StormyMay#4100: I have a laptop that I hand picked the specs for to get me through art school comfortably and dark souls 3 really chugs on it so
 Merus#7019: duct tape and hope
 BadPiggy#5202: I have played Bloodborne PSX though. That was amazing
 Merus#7019: it's okay, they barely work on high-powered machines either
 voithos#0258: Aw 😢
 BadPiggy#5202: None of Fromsoftware's games work on my potato lol
 voithos#0258: Incidentally, I beat Elden Ring the other day (it's a _huuuuge_ game... I've been playing since launch). Would highly recommend 🙂
 StormyMay#4100: Just checked my stats, at 30 runs, 48 max chambers cleared, elysium boss fight attempted multiple times but not yet beaten
 voithos#0258: And yeah, there is _some_ level of "maybe I should go get stronger first" but at some point you start realizing that it's 90% just mastering the boss, and 10% your build (which you start seeing patterns in too - e.g. X class of enemy is strong against Y type of damage, so don't use that one)
 Merus#7019: but also you meet a maiden like an hour in, it seems like
 voithos#0258: It is, but it's not quite the meme's meaning
 Merus#7019: it is
 BadPiggy#5202: Also was the whole " maindenless " thing actually part of the lore ? Or was it just a meme ?
 Merus#7019: I am a high-functioning perfectionist but sometimes it breaks through and destroys me
 Merus#7019: anyway you understand why I'm not participating in the game jam
 voithos#0258: I've heard a lot of folks praise Elden Ring for that, actually - the not-having-brick-walls thing. Of course, it still does at times, but not as often
 BadPiggy#5202: I haven't played elden ring, but isn't the entire point of the open world that you can just go somewhere else if you find some place too challenging ?
 Merus#7019: like, I have a huge list of justifications why I should try again at a hard boss, but there is still the thing in the back of my mind that says that dying to a hard boss means you should never have attempted it
 voithos#0258: Meaning, why not just pack up and go somewhere else?
 Merus#7019: why should I fight a hard boss, ever?
 BadPiggy#5202: I want to play Sekiro so badly
 Merus#7019: I find Elden Ring pretty rough going as a result
 Merus#7019: FromSoft games are definitely on that _edge_ for me, but they don't trip the same feeling, and the way they're arranged where certain bosses are just blockers does make it a bit easier for me to tough it out
 BadPiggy#5202: FURi made me love player progression more to the point that I don't really like rpg-esque upgrades in games anymore lol
 voithos#0258: I really like Souls games for that reason, because even though the _primary_ progress is mostly player skill (i.e. it's hard to cheese your way out of late game bosses if you never really learned how to play well), there is still the aspect of character progression and moving / exploring the world as you move from checkpoint to checkpoint
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I finished Medusa's storyline before I reached the surface for the first time, which is also unusual in the opposite direction 😄
 BadPiggy#5202: I had 40 I think lol
 Merus#7019: lot of deaths on the Duo
 StormyMay#4100: I think i'm on ~25 iirc
 Hobusu#5033: Yeah, I think I had like 20 deaths before my first clear?
 BadPiggy#5202: This might be a hot take, but either way ....
Player progression > Character progression
 StormyMay#4100: you did what
 Merus#7019: I cleared Hades with like 9 deaths, which I understand is unusual
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: it’s very unreasonable to beat spelunky on your first try lol
 Merus#7019: and I get a little something something so that the next attempt is different and possibly smoother
 Merus#7019: whereas Hades, it's unreasonable for me to know how to kill the bosses first time, so I don't feel bad dying to them
 voithos#0258: I think my main beef with roguelikes is simply that progress tends to be opaque. Sure, I'm improving at the game, but it's a nondeterministic process, and I could easily completely botch a run even if my last one wasn't so bad. And when restarting from 0, it's hard to remind oneself that progress is actually being made
 Merus#7019: it's the same feeling I had with Toki Tori 2, funnily enough
 Merus#7019: Spelunky trips this thing I have where, if it's _possible_ to clear something first time, I feel duty-bound to do so, and if I don't I stop having fun
 BadPiggy#5202: Maybe the final boss of downwell is a big difficulty spike, but apart from that, I'd say it's a gradual and good difficulty curve
 Merus#7019: but I've never been able to get into Spelunky
 StormyMay#4100: I feel like thats what sells hades for me though. like I am mediocre at games at best so if I can never get further I get frustrated and put it down and my skill is the only factor there
 BadPiggy#5202: Bah. It's not that hard
 Merus#7019: I really liked Downwell - never finished it, did see the final boss though
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: hades actually has a great difficulty curve with the heat system imo
 Hobusu#5033: Downwell is also great! Though even its own creator has said that when playtesting it for bug fixes he's like "why did I make this so hard??"
 BadPiggy#5202: Downwell ftw
 Merus#7019: you know how Mark had to redo the roguelike video because his conclusion was that roguelikes with run progression are strictly worse than games that don't have it?
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: and spelunky 2! love da spelunky
 M_Raven#4076: In all seriousness, yeah I agree with Piggy
 Hobusu#5033: Yeah, Mark tends to prefer the style of roguelike that doesn't have permanent upgrades between runs
 BadPiggy#5202: Frankly I can understand if someone doesn't like it. For all its' charm, it can get repetitive ( like most rogue-ey games )
 M_Raven#4076: Mark doesn’t like **what**
 StormyMay#4100: roguelikes usually arent my flavor but hades just has a certain charm to it for me
 Lawn#1538: He didn't *get* it
 Merus#7019: protip: Mark doesn't like Hades, and we all rag on him for it
 StormyMay#4100: asterius is a dirty cheater
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: I played a bunch of hades and even more Slay the Spire and Isaac
 StormyMay#4100: yeah those guys
 BadPiggy#5202: The Bois ?
Oh wait. Asterius and Theseus lol
 Hobusu#5033: Hades is fantastic
 StormyMay#4100: I got all the way to elysium and fighting The Bois before I got sidetracked from hades I was getting rlly far. probs out of practice now oof
 Scolon#4218: Shadow is typing in their sleep, whoa
 BadPiggy#5202: And I haven't made it through much of rogue legacy.
But I did finish Hades lol
 BadPiggy#5202: I still can't get past the 3rd floor in gungeon lol
 BadPiggy#5202: I'll admit this lol
 StormyMay#4100: got sidetracked from it finishing horizon forbidden west
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Same!
 voithos#0258: One of the only roguelikes I actually finished
 StormyMay#4100: you just reminded me I gotta play hades bro
 BadPiggy#5202: In some aspects, yes
 voithos#0258: I loved Hades!
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Hades > Dead Cells
 BadPiggy#5202: Crap. Just mentioning dead cells makes me want to play again. Maybe after work
 voithos#0258: Oh yeah, for sure. It's kinda the main modus operandi of lots of metroidvanias
 voithos#0258: Yep, the classic enemy-that's-actually-just-an-obstacle
 BadPiggy#5202: I mean even Dead cells does it kek
 Hobusu#5033: Just copy NES games and have them do simple things like "walk forward until you bump into a wall, then turn around and repeat", heh
 BadPiggy#5202: ***scope/feature creep***
 voithos#0258: I guess I was trying to be too fancy (the RTS game has some notion of "swarm strength" where you have to time your advances or else you'll get overwhelmed, and the AI had to understand that)
 voithos#0258: Heh true
 BadPiggy#5202: If all else, use a navmesh and just say move towards some point kek
 voithos#0258: Good point good point. I also wonder if I subconsciously want to avoid making enemy AI? I made an RTS game at one point, and the AI by itself took like 10 hours to make  😅
 tykenn#8548: I've done one jam with "combat", except nothing fights back. And one where you sabotage a stage play by dropping a piano on someone. Other than that, not really anything that could be considered combat.
 Sandra#4621: so many games have it, its not that unique. in a game jam, go for something else unless you get an idea that fits it combat
 SlingingPlant145#5532: I wish 80% of the team finder posts weren't asking for only Unity...
 voithos#0258: It's definitely not a rational decision though... it's just a weird gut instinct I get
 Sandra#4621: combat is complicated and also kinda boring
 Scolon#4218: Nah i love my combat
 BadPiggy#5202: Action games require a heavy amount of tightening in terms of design, so I don't blame you at all
Can definitely feel a bit much for a jam
 tykenn#8548: yeah, combat feels to "normal" for my jam ideas
 voithos#0258: Random question, since someone mentioned combat: for whatever reason, during game jams, I get this weird desire to _not_ make a game with any kind of combat system... does anyone else feel that? It's odd, because some of my favorite games are combat heavy (metroidvanias, soulslikes, etc)
 BadPiggy#5202: Aye, let's see what it ends up being lol
 Scolon#4218: That said I want to strictly adhere to it
 Scolon#4218: The theme is very open to interpretation and is usually quite broad so
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: 48 hours
 JJfriends#3686: How longs the jam btw?
 BadPiggy#5202: I have an idea for a combat system which basically just focusses on aggressive play above all else and I did try a small prototype a while back, though if the theme allows it, I'd love to try something different with it here lol
 StormyMay#4100: bro genshin just got an update today I got gaming to do
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: A lot of people take their jam games and give themselves a week or a month to just take out the bugs and add a bit of polish to kind of get it where they were hoping for it to be for the jam, then then upload that new version and leave it as-is. That's super common
 JJfriends#3686: Day 4 of no teamate or bitches
 Fraserfatt#1021: need more for that portfolio.  Job searching is going... slowly.
 Fraserfatt#1021: I just need a kick in the butt to *do* something, honestly. That's why I'm doin this 😂
 BadPiggy#5202: I sometimes do that lol
 Scolon#4218: I usually use game jams as a way to experiment with new ideas for another project im working on
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I have work in the morning. I'm gonna get ready to.... **SLEEP.**
 BadPiggy#5202: I revisited one of my old games, but even that was just to try out new mechanics lol
 voithos#0258: Plus, it'll always be there as an idea/prototype if you ever want to take it to the next level 🙂
 StormyMay#4100: reminds me of a pottery study I read about. half a class was graded on the amount of pottery they produced and half were graded on the quality, and the quantity students actually showed significantly more improvement
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Often we see words or subjects coming up in conversation and we just getin with a quick warning just to catch it before it might start. Just because a mod says "lets not start a conversation about X" doesn't mean that anyone has done anything wrong, it might just be preventative
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I have yet to revisit a game Jam game I made.
 BadPiggy#5202: Yup
 Fraserfatt#1021: yeeee exactly
 voithos#0258: Yep exactly. I actually _really_ like it when I feel like my game is "good enough" after the jam and I can just walk away. It feels good to be able to build something small but satisfying in a short period of time, and then just move on
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: And if your game Jam isnt fun, then the game wont be fun.
 Selviam#7268: Ooooo that sounds amazing!
 BadPiggy#5202: Basically if you don't sleep, then you won't be fun
And if you're not fun, then your game jam game won't be fun
 StormyMay#4100: yep! concentration on concepting for games
 Fraserfatt#1021: That is also true. It's important to know when to set your stuff aside and have it be "finished" enough. You gotta let your babies *go*.  Something I heard from my 3d modelling courses
 Selviam#7268: it says you go to SCAD in your bio do you major in illustration?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: No that's ok, we don't mind conversation, I slept for 4 hours last night, it happens. Its more about the jokes of "this is just how game jams are" etc. you've done nothing wrong
 Scolon#4218: Yeah I  might touch my project post-jam depending on the reception and how I feel about it. I have no intent of turning it into a large-scale project though
 Fraserfatt#1021: it's brutal, from what I hear. Animation was biiig at our college
 voithos#0258: Beware of the polish trap, though! The olde "this'll only take like another week or two just to shine it up..." and then you wake up 10 months later
 BadPiggy#5202: Most people will most likely drop their games after the jam though.
That's just how it is kek
 StormyMay#4100: one of my roommates this year was anim, got very used to random hugs bc she needed the emotional support
 Fraserfatt#1021: **You can also polish your games after the jam for your portfolio**. No rule that you gotta *drop* it once it's done
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: It's absolutely your choice what you do with your own body, if you make the decision to not sleep etc that is your choice, but we won't entertain anyone either bragging about it or saying things such as "if you sleep you're not dedicated enough". That is not what this jam is about
 darlingS#1797: I sorta joke about my bad sleep schedule in general coz highschool sorry
 Scolon#4218: But yeah, I don't think people really go around saying their game made in under 48 hours isn't polished enough. That wouldn't make much sense
 Fraserfatt#1021: I feel bad for the animation students
 StormyMay#4100: its worse from my perspective I go to art school and they're not jokes ppl really just arent sleeping so can confirm
 darlingS#1797: Oops sorry
 Fraserfatt#1021: too many people in my capstone made jokes about "not sleeping" and "grinding". So uncomfortable to hear 😓
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Please remember not to make jokes about not eating/sleeping/etc for the game jam. These "jokes" aren't really funny when you consider how badly the games industry has a worker crunch problem and this jam is meant to be a fun challenge, it is not meant to be practice for putting up with bad work environments
 BadPiggy#5202: Go to sleep shadow
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637:  **BROOKLYN!!** 
 darlingS#1797: (I say, getting average amounts of sleep and never having coffee)
 Sandra#4621: yeah I'm... well aware of the nature of game dev and as such I really don't judge a game in 48 hours for not being polished, and would much rather the game be *interesting*
 Fraserfatt#1021: last jam I did, the team was such a mess 😭. I got buuuurned out
 Lawn#1538: Is there such a thing as less sleep than 12 hours?
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637:  **NO SLEEP TIL** 
 BadPiggy#5202: This lol.
After doing gamedev, it'll take a game to be really bad for me to dislike it
 voithos#0258: I mean, unless you plan on sleeping 12 hours a night...
 darlingS#1797: I don't need sleep I need caffeine
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: naa you only get 24, new rules
 SlingingPlant145#5532: It seems like by this point, most teams are already full or have too many members.
 Scolon#4218: Don't destroy your life for the jam lmao
 Lawn#1538: You were once a supporter of that, you’ve changed man.
 Lawn#1538: Sleep.
 Lawn#1538: Sleep shadow.
 Sandra#4621: ^^^^^^
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I  think once most people see what they managed to make in the 48 hours it tempers their expectations for something AAA polished. The people most likely to say that they understand the rough edges and the bugs etc are the people who have done jams or game dev themselves because they know how hard the 48 hours was and how much effort that buggy prototype looked
 Nobody6502#8971: oh I have an engine I just dislike adobe after effects minspecs
 Sandra#4621: one that I've certainly had to live with 😛
 voithos#0258: And I think certain game ideas actually only start to shine when layered with sufficient variety / supporting mechanics (which is just more scope, so harder for solo dev)
 Sandra#4621: yeah, its a limitation
 Lawn#1538: Might have to use an engine that supports your computer’s specs if that’s the case.
 voithos#0258: Yes of course, I didn't mean to imply otherwise. The larger a team, the more coordination overhead, so there are definitely lots of benefits to avoiding that. That being said, larger teams can take on more scope, so given similarly-interesting game ideas and similar levels of skills, a larger team may be able to make a more fleshed out / detailed game
 Scolon#4218: I can heavily relate to that
 BadPiggy#5202: Apologies. I've gotten so used to making GIFs that I could cook one up quickly lol.
I'm forgetting that not everyone is accustomed to it
 Merus#7019: so, uh, good luck to that team
 Nobody6502#8971: 
sometimes having a bad computer can be a limitation

 Merus#7019: this can be _difficult_ to achieve with 24 people in the group
 Merus#7019: definitely try and join a group where your sensibilities are going to mesh with each other, so you're all excited by what each other is working on
 SlingingPlant145#5532: I am starting to question whether working in a group will be worth it this time. I wanted to do it because working solo was tough last time, but when the original group's team lead had to drop out, and the backup group I joined seems to have a bunch of drama, I wonder if going solo again would really be the best option. :/
 RedTeapot#1960: It wasn't action-packed really and doing stuff to specifically make a thumbnail gif takes me quite a while. A static image like that takes maybe 10-20 minutes to make
 voithos#0258: Yeah, I think part of that probably just has to do with how humans are wired to notice shiny things. Personally, I like seeing polished jam games, because I think it flexes useful skills (including scope management!), and it results in a really neat final product (even if it is just a jam game)
 Selviam#7268: ive had too many experiences where i carry group projects so joining a group for a jam is worrying for me
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: for sure do because it's really important for people to know what the team expectations are and what it's try to achieve
 M_Raven#4076: This is something I will relay to the coordinator
 RedTeapot#1960: It does but it's still possible to win solo if you come up with an interesting idea and execute it _well enough_
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I really think you need to check in and see how many people are actually taking it seriously and want to produce a game vs how many people aren;t worried about it and just wanted the lols of joining a bog group because if there's some people actually excited and dedicated it could be ruined for them if the team doesn't know if its a joke or not. Hope that makes sense
 BadPiggy#5202: Actually I think I still remember your entry lol.
Would have made for a nice gif tbh
But aight
 Sandra#4621: tbh I think its unfortunate how so many people do judge the production value, personally I would give a lot of leniency to someone who made a game in 48 hours, like, I'd rather you spent that time on more interesting game rather than production value but that's just my own opinion, (I have no input on judging more than anyone else in the world)
 BadPiggy#5202: More like a decent balance between both
 RedTeapot#1960: Well, a static thumbnail generated quite a number of clicks for me last year
 voithos#0258: Eh, I think production value certainly plays a part. Even the best ideas won't really be compelling if poorly executed
 BadPiggy#5202: Frankly it's better to have a catchy gif as a thumbnail rather than a static art piece
No offense to anyone who draws them cus they're awesome, but you want to give people every reason possible to click on your game, and in this case, showing the game itself in a gif works wonders
 RedTeapot#1960: I believe some of the winners were indeed solo. It's more about the concept rather than the production value
 voithos#0258: It'd be neat if the jam eventually had like a special "solo" category 🙂 Just to give some context at least, when being compared to a game built by a 12-person team...
 M_Raven#4076: We have a Trello board and a dream
 RedTeapot#1960: Like having a dedicated thumbnail person kek
 BadPiggy#5202: Aye well, roughly 2 days for the theme now....
Argh
 RedTeapot#1960: Although it might turn out amazing if well organized
 BadPiggy#5202: Anthing more than 3 is a big team lol
 M_Raven#4076: Fair. Shadow’s running an 11-person team
 RedTeapot#1960: 12 is still quite a number to me
 M_Raven#4076: To be honest, half of us aren’t expecting to be active during the jam. It might end up functioning more like a team of 12
 M_Raven#4076: It’s 1:51 and the gender problems are really starting to hit now 😔
 RedTeapot#1960: I wonder how much of a game it should be to give 23 people some work though
 M_Raven#4076: (We technically aren’t, it’s just someone who wants to hang out while they’re working on their own submission)
 RedTeapot#1960: We don't have Taco Bell here so I have no idea actually. Gotta learn from the memes
 M_Raven#4076: WE’RE UP TO 24
 M_Raven#4076: HEY, HEY SHADOW
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: My ass will be fine. I still got Discord on my phone. I can still VC while I'm in the oval office.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Lol.
 RedTeapot#1960: 🥁
 Sandra#4621: boo
 Lawn#1538: ~~Dead is indeed what your ass will be after those meals.~~
 Sandra#4621: (I still don't know what the message actually says but that's how to decode it if someone feels like putting in the work)
 Sandra#4621: it looked like it was a space given the message sent 😛
 Sandra#4621: well actually I don't really remember off the top of my head which one is capital and which is lowercase but looking at the particular message sent, it seemed to begin with one and then continue with the other so I could make a guess. same with 20
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: To the town of Agua Fria met a stranger one fine day.
Didn't talk to folks around em, didnt have to much to saaaay.
No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip
For the stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip.
***BIG IRON ON HIS HIIIIIIP***
 RedTeapot#1960: Oh yeah, I've seen a video describing that trick
 Sandra#4621: and then it counts up
 Sandra#4621: I don't actually, I just know that 01000001 is 'A' and 01100001 is 'a' (notice how there's just one bit telling the capitalisation apart)
 Phallo#3476: i might even cook in advance for the whole jam time
 RedTeapot#1960: And buy the food in advance
 M_Raven#4076: ^^^ wake up with time to prepare
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Try to wake up with enough time to make breakfast or sumn.
 M_Raven#4076: Still 23
 Phallo#3476: im trying to break my sleep schedule so much that i wake up just before the jam starts
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: How big is your team now?
 Lawn#1538: The shadow man coming to get them
 M_Raven#4076: I no longer follow orders
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: God damn it...
 Lawn#1538: Not at gunpoint.
 Lawn#1538: Now they definitely won’t be able to sleep
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: *That's an order.*
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Y'all all need to go to sleep. Lol. Save your energy for the Jam.
 Sandra#4621: I don't feel like translating manually but that's how you do it, 61 is 'a', 62 is 'b', and so on.
 Phallo#3476: 2:40am here wheeee
 syelan34#3258: Yep
 M_Raven#4076: EST gang?
 syelan34#3258: It’s 1:40 am for me rn
 Sandra#4621: the ones starting with 6 and 7 are lowercase letters, 4 is an uppercase letter, and then 20 I believe is just a space
 M_Raven#4076: I should be sleeping rn but uhhhhhhhhhhhh
 syelan34#3258: Lol
 M_Raven#4076: I have no idea I just looked up a translator
 RedTeapot#1960: Yeah so both statements are valid. It's both a valid ASCII and utf-8 sequence
 Sandra#4621: yeah but its not anything that's not ascii, the MSB is 0 in all of those
 RedTeapot#1960: ASCII is a subset of utf-8 though
 Sandra#4621: its ascii
 Sandra#4621: nah it isn't
 syelan34#3258: Or is it UTF-8?
 M_Raven#4076: 77 65 61 6B 6C 69 6E 67
 RedTeapot#1960: I don't read hex ASCII, sorry
 M_Raven#4076: 48 65 6C 6C 6F 20 74 6F 20 79 6F 75 20 74 6F 6F
 Lawn#1538: Ata mārie, mōrena
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Buenos dias, gamers y game devs.
 Rosta#6232: GOod morning
 Zoro5168#0115: Gmornin
 syelan34#3258: Great music
 birdstone#3073: WOOO more doom music enjoyers
 _Nate#3737: No worries haha, but yeah obscurity that's exactly what I was thinking
 Pixstatic#3464: sorry for the late response to that
 Pixstatic#3464: obscurity
 Melwing#3159:  I happened to see this. I sent you a message
 BadPiggy#5202: Ah, a fellow DOOM music enjoyer
 Fraserfatt#1021: 3am goes crazy
 Yollie#2239: yes exactly one moment in melbourne its 32 degrees next moment its pouring and 2 minutes later theres a bushfire in some hill
 Lawn#1538: Melbourne goes from snow to sun in minutes.
 Yollie#2239: well sometimes it rains for like a week but for some reason this year it aint raining much
 Lawn#1538: Just random weather constantly.
 Yollie#2239: melbourne basically doesnt get insane rainfall
 Yollie#2239: it rained a bit here before but it stopped now
 Lawn#1538: Hail storm in Byron looked fun.
 Lawn#1538: How bout that rain?
 Yollie#2239: ayo?
 Lawn#1538: Yeah G’day
 Yollie#2239: Aussie gang?
 Lawn#1538: Same, it gets real busy around 3am here.
 RedTeapot#1960: But what about engineers?
 M_Raven#4076: Architects released a new song :D
 RedTeapot#1960: In fact, the chat gets more active when I need to go to sleep
 Merus#7019: oh don't do that, I used to do that
 PepperBoi#4544: I always stay up until 3:00 so I can speak with you sometimes
 Merus#7019: I'm in a meeting
 Lawn#1538: The dozen of us in Oceania and Asia can talk amongst ourselves.
 Merus#7019: I dislike that this is true
 Lawn#1538: Europe is asleep and the USA is not far off it either. I’m in favour of the respite.
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: Just found out "updation" is a word.
 RedTeapot#1960: Is it time to write "dead chat" yet? Just woke up and don't know what to write
 ghost 1#4387: Yeah I think I just figured that out.
 RedTeapot#1960: If you read it, you'll see the link to the website
 Henry_Hamster#4240: Read the first post and click the link which will send you to the website
 ghost 1#4387: It's telling me I don't have permission to send messages. Also it's only showing the initial one about the rules.
 Lawn#1538: Can you not see into ?
 Lawn#1538: There are a few people in  looking for someone that have had no hits on team finder, but I would recommend putting up an ad on the team finder as well.
 ghost 1#4387: And just wait for access to the teamfinder channel?
 ghost 1#4387: Yeah, that's fair.
 Henry_Hamster#4240: True, silence could work as a mechanic, but I still feel like its not very good at helping people generate ideas
 ghost 1#4387: I wasn't imagining something survival horror where you need to stay quiet else your dad is all that it could be.
 Henry_Hamster#4240: but at the same time, not too inspiring outside of the atmosphere
 Henry_Hamster#4240: like quiet would be a lot better as well since its more about like the environment and the feel of the game
 _Nate#3737: I could imagine a slight alteration to silence might work. Something about depriving the player of some sort of information typically needed for the genre (Though I can't think of a good way to surmise that though)
 ghost 1#4387: It could come into mechanics but I feel like there's a very limited spectrum of games where that would work.
 PepperBoi#4544: And all of the themes mark has chosen are mechanics focused
 ghost 1#4387: Fair enough
 Henry_Hamster#4240: Silence would be a very interesting, but honestly not very inspiring theme
 ghost 1#4387: Sorry.
 PepperBoi#4544: Also you look in 
 ghost 1#4387: You never know.
 PepperBoi#4544: I'd give a 99.99% chance its not silence
 ghost 1#4387: I had wanted to say unless the theme is something like silence, someone to assist with music would be nice. Most I've done with music that sounds good it's like 6 seconds of argent metal.
 ghost 1#4387: Hi this is actually going to be the first game jam I'll be doing. It's really exciting.
 Lawn#1538: Plus, it’s more likely to be seen by someone who will be awake later as the tech channel doesn’t get flooded.
 Lawn#1538: Cheers. It’s pretty slow here at the moment, but it seems to pick up at moments notice with teens and memes.
 DaveB#7491:  No worries. I can ask over there as not to muddy the chat here.
 Scolon#4218: I just checked the microsoft visual studio page. It says it supports c++
 DaveB#7491: I’m a Mac guy, but I’m borrowing my buddy’s Windows laptop.
 Lawn#1538: Might need to move this to 
 DaveB#7491: When I went looking for Visual Studio, the free one I found on MS’ site didn’t have any C++ project templates.
 null_ham#2050: are you using windows?
 Scolon#4218: wdym by only version of visual studio you could find?
 DaveB#7491: The only version of Visual Studio I could find doesn’t support C++.
 null_ham#2050: can i ask why you're using vscode and not just visual studio?
 null_ham#2050: its usually the properties file
 DaveB#7491: I won’t be able to do the Jam if I can’t get it building. 😦
 DaveB#7491: It’s just something in either my make command or something in VSCode’s cpp_properties file.
 DaveB#7491: I’m using a Makefile for calling g++, but I keep fixing one problem and finding another. The code compiles perfectly on my Mac in Xcode, so I know the code itself is fine.
 null_ham#2050: it just calls a console command anyway
 null_ham#2050: i dont even use the vscode build commands
 DaveB#7491: By any odd chance, is anyone who’s rolling a custom engine have any experience with getting a C++ project to build in VS Code on Windows? I’m tearing my hear out (well, figuratively) trying to get my codebase building and it feels like whack-a-mole with compiler errors. 😦
 null_ham#2050: Kadie#0179
 Lawn#1538: Did you leave the server at any point? 
 RedTeapot#1960: I think it happens when the bot can't mention the user for some reason. Pings disabled perhaps?
 Mattstov(Matt) ⃤#8596: 880869263655698442 was the name lul
 Mattstov(Matt) ⃤#8596: mhm
 Lawn#1538: Are you talking about the team finder?
 Mattstov(Matt) ⃤#8596: weird
 KTrigger#6227: Idk why it didn’t show my name
 KTrigger#6227: It was me
 Mattstov(Matt) ⃤#8596: how do we find who the person who was interested in taming with us if it doesnt say the name
 Scolon#4218: awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 PepperBoi#4544: Cool!
 coconut_orange#3725: Hello there!
Joining because I followed the YT channel, and signed up for the Jam with a friend
 Big Cheese#7612: ^
 ADEEL#5105: Ok Thanks
 Scolon#4218: you can go to 
 ADEEL#5105: Hey how the team up works?is there gonna be a team finding grp
 yugioh#7402: I can't leave you hanging
 yugioh#7402: And welcome to the jam
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: ||**COME ON AND SLAM!**||
 darlingS#1797: Oh you mean Space Jam
 Lyfe#8258: Jam by Yahtzee Croshaw
 Lyfe#8258: Lemme look it up hold on
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Goosebumps?
 Lyfe#8258: I think I saw a book blurb with this premise somewhere
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yep
 Scolon#4218: I'll just throw out all my unused ideas into here
 DrNukeLear#2414: Totally misread the last word of this sentence as “whale”
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: people will throw out ideas for people to use and help people get ideas narrowed down etc
 yugioh#7402: Flesh eating jam
 darlingS#1797: The real friends was the jam we made along the way
 Scolon#4218: Ah okay, that makes sense
 yugioh#7402: No it's the one piece
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: that will be what this room turns into for a while
 Scolon#4218: I don't remember, but is there a theme discussion channel when it is announced?
 Murten#0001: I'm on the fence if I want to join a team or not.
 darlingS#1797: No, random ideas spawned in an hour
 yugioh#7402: No talking to mark
 PepperBoi#4544: No, exposure
 darlingS#1797: We're paid in experience
 yugioh#7402: I read it as funding first and i thought from where will they get the money
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: there will be a  room opening a bit before the jam starts for people who need it
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: please use team finder for finding teams, not here. You'll have mixed results anywhere you ask so may as well stick to the right place
 Booter#8781: been having mixed results with teamfinding, so just throwing it out there, if your team needs a programmer or 3d modeler, send me a dm 😄
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: aww I thought I had some left but I finished it at lunch.... 😦 it'll have to be a chicken sammich instead
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: 
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yum
 Murten#0001: 🤨 is by far the best default emoji.
 DrNukeLear#2414: Okay: 🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I'm gonna need more crabs if I have to put up with this 😄
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: One sec...
 yugioh#7402: It's also 3am here
 SquidGeneral10#4090: Can't imagine this one sees much use 🖲️
 redka#6365: I might try some Unity after the jam, just out of curiosity (the engine is still blegh)
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: As per usual. Lol.
 DrNukeLear#2414: 📎 < Because it strikes fear into Office 97-2003 users.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: move the excessive emoji stuff to 
 wren#0640: 🥴
 gltile#9411: 😵‍💫
 nekiwo#7574: 😖
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: 🤫 < this one for me. most infuriating feeling emoji on earth
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: 🥺
 BurnV06#5857: 😳 is objectively the worst emoji
 Scolon#4218: Literally unplayable
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: FAQ: "How is it pay to win?"
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: You also need to be a Patreon to use external emojis.
 Gallow#3741: Alright I'm sold gotta get nitro now
 Lyfe#8258: The 😏 is extremely funny to put after an innocuous sentence like "just ate some fruit 😏"
 Lyfe#8258: You can destroy someone's reputation with the 🤓 emoji
 Gallow#3741: this is the only emoji I'll ever need 🗿
 gltile#9411: 😌
 Murten#0001: And I like server profiles.
 Murten#0001: I like my emojis.
 gltile#9411: imagine paying either
 Murten#0001: I'm already paying discord. I don't have the money to also be a Patreon.
 gltile#9411: patron moment
 Murten#0001: Actually cheating.
 BurnV06#5857: I have 1
 Murten#0001: I'm by myself and suck at art. 👍
 redka#6365: we have 9 members total
 Murten#0001: I'm gone on Friday and Saturday but last year I was working a 48 hour week during the jam so this is an improvement.
 M_Raven#4076: I’ll be gone for most of Friday due to work, but I’ll be there for the rest of the jam
 Murten#0001: I got an email...
 gltile#9411: we have 7 org members so
 aaaa-trsh#4800: ill help a little bit but I'm mostly on the road right now
 nekiwo#7574: you cant? 😢
 aaaa-trsh#4800: like me :(
 nekiwo#7574: unironically though, because i think a lot might not participate so we might just end up with half or less show up
 darlingS#1797: How many people are there already?
 Murten#0001: Yeah, I guess small communities might pick up on those.
 BurnV06#5857: Can we hit 100 before the jam starts?
 aaaa-trsh#4800: nOo
 M_Raven#4076: NO WE DONT
 Murten#0001: No emojis from other servers. 😭
 nekiwo#7574: we need more xd
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: the ones that do well are usually ones that catch the attention of one of the patreons who drag everyone into voice chat and we play togeher
 Murten#0001: First time?
 DrNukeLear#2414: Activate order 66?
 Murten#0001: I also don't think it would get played a lot as people usually have the patience of a chimpanzee high on amphetamine; and waiting for a game to fill with other people takes more than 5 seconds.
 M_Raven#4076: Discord betrayed me 😭
 Hobusu#5033: Weird!
 BurnV06#5857: No there is
 M_Raven#4076: There’s a slow mode my discord just isn’t showing it
 Hobusu#5033: There should be 15 seconds still, you can see it at the bottom of your screen
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: there is slowmode
 BurnV06#5857: Let me check
 redka#6365: that is too many people
 M_Raven#4076: Wait oh my god is there no slow mode?
EDIT: no there is my discord is stupid
 M_Raven#4076: *evil cackling*
 redka#6365: why 23 people
 BurnV06#5857: *insert prequel meme here*
 aaaa-trsh#4800: !!!
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yeah there's definitely multiplayer games that have been made but it's a whole extra level of difficulty
 gltile#9411: theres only like 10 people that are actually going to do it im sure
 M_Raven#4076: Yes
 Capybara#8868: Another member of the 23-member council?
 gltile#9411: 👋
 M_Raven#4076:  I awaken you from your slumber
 redka#6365: networking seems like too much stuff to handle in a short time period
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yeah it can definitely happen, but yes very rare
 redka#6365: honestly i'd go with couch co-op for a multiplayer jam game
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I'm not sure, try in tech help. Good luck
 aaaa-trsh#4800: butterscotch shenanigans (indie studio) made one for their own game jam and it was great, but those are REALLY rare
 parks19#1135: nvm someone just replied
 parks19#1135: ok. i have already tried sending my problem to the tech help channel
 redka#6365: I'd search for similar problems on UE5 forums
 redka#6365: Not a tech support channel
 redka#6365: You're giving very little information plus this chat is for game jam discussion
 parks19#1135: can anyone help me please. I would like to fix this as soon as possible. thank oyu
 redka#6365: So try not to marginalize audio or leave it for the last moment, having properly implemented audio can really help your game
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: So generally people don't make multiplayer games for jams because 2 days is not a long time to make stuff. That said you are allowed to, just be aware that very few people will be able to play it. There have been multiplayer games like Plan-It.
Mark would try to play every game in the top 100 so if a multiplayer game was in there he would give it a go but if he was unable to play it then it is what it is
 redka#6365: Even something as simple as two distinct sounds for picking up and dropping items makes a large difference in experience
 Xansta#2422: I found this:
Just note that many players will be alone  and will only have a few minutes to try your game (so get to the point quickly!)
...which largely answers my question. Thanks , 
 redka#6365: Audio can change otherwise boring or lifeless scenes into something more
 redka#6365: One thing I learnt from doing a test run is NEVER underestimate audio
 parks19#1135: Hello, I am asking the UE5 users how to fix this error. "The asset '/Game/UI/MainMenu/OptionsMenu_WBP' (OptionsMenu_WBP.uasset) failed to save.
I have already tried to restart Unreal Engine but that did not work
Also it doesn't save anything anywhere else
 M_Raven#4076: I think it’s sort of just expected that your game should be playable solo but **theoretically** you can make a multiplayer game
 nekiwo#7574: making one isnt recommended during a jam because:
- harder to debug/impliment 
- needs hosting resources
- very likely not to have enough players to be fun
 PureSly#3368: hi
 M_Raven#4076: Honestly I don’t think there’s any rules implemented for multiplayer games at all, since very few people will be trying to make one for a game jam. Of course that’s only what I know, I may be wrong
 Xansta#2422: Hi folks,
First time here. The help channels do not seem to cover general questions, so I'll ask it here. Please direct me to the appropriate channel if there is one 🙂
How are multi-player games handled? I read the bit where Mark plays the top 100 games, but it does not mention how a multiplayer game is handled. In particular, I'm interested in how a multiplayer collaborative game is handled.
Any insight would be appreciated...
 Redderick#3333: Clients don't know what they want most of the time.
 StormyMay#4100: Bless
 DrNukeLear#2414: It also means that they can tell you that they got the size wrong and change their mind before you finish a masterpiece 😉
 StormyMay#4100: Wait thats actually really smart thanks
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: that's fair
 Capybara#8868: solos rise up
 Jeker#3389: Well i have an artist, and a friend allowed me to use their music
 redka#6365: I love tool dev it's so fun to make tools for designers
 redka#6365: We're split in 3 aspects programming wise, I do tool dev and gameplay implementation, one dev does bugfixing and settings and one other dev does puzzle logic and physics interactions
 DrNukeLear#2414: Didn’t think I’d read it either.
 redka#6365: We have a pretty simple team, 3 programmers, 3 artists, a designer and a musician
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Ok lets move on from foetus conversation now thank you
^ sentences I thought I'd never say
 DrNukeLear#2414: Probably yours now.
 nekiwo#7574: what was the largest ever team in the jam?
 Jeker#3389: I actually watched them, to take notes on what games usually do well
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Maybe and he was possibly joking he certainly didn't consider that to be a ruling this year
 M_Raven#4076: 🔥👄🔥
 BurnV06#5857: I’ve watched those vids like a dozen times each
 Jeker#3389: Will i be spared if i join early?
 BurnV06#5857: Yeah he did
 Capybara#8868: That’s fair
 BurnV06#5857: According to worldometers, that current population of earth is 7.96 billion. So we probably have 8B already if you count fetuses
 Jeker#3389: I think it was a joke
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: 😈
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Not until we form our mega 20k person team and take over GMTK.
 Capybara#8868: I swear he said it briefly in the 2021 video
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: that's not something I'm aware of
 DrNukeLear#2414: Vibe
 Jeker#3389: True
 Fraserfatt#1021: audio
 BurnV06#5857: Make the engine
 Jeker#3389: What would fetuses do tho?
 BurnV06#5857: Including fetuses
 M_Raven#4076: *sweats nervously*
 Capybara#8868: Ye it was but def less than 20
 BurnV06#5857: We should just get the entire population of earth on one team
 Jeker#3389: Aaaand thats about it
 Jeker#3389: I remember it was a 2 digit number
 BurnV06#5857: Like 12 I think
 Jeker#3389: I mean, what was it like 20 people?
 DrNukeLear#2414: Pro tip: When you get asked for artwork do a very fast mock up (right size, shape, stick figures are perfect) and supply that quickly so that that can be used as a placeholder while you take time producing good work. The devs can swap the images when the artwork is complete.
 caibi#2508: Can I play a jam solo without any coding? putting other pieces togheter.
 BurnV06#5857: Yeah I was joking
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Solo is fine, I was saying he would probably recommend around 4 people rather than a bigger team
 M_Raven#4076: Ah that one
 BurnV06#5857: The electricity one
 StormyMay#4100: Appreciated!! Though it is more about feeling there's no general advice out there. I mean I am a freelancer already and I know the ropes of working with clients, just not in a game team atmosphere
 M_Raven#4076: Wait which game?
 M_Raven#4076: I went solo last year
 Capybara#8868: He also considered limiting the amount per team because of that one game last year right?
 BurnV06#5857: I know it’s a joke
 Scolon#4218: solo isn't that bad tbh
 BurnV06#5857: *laughs in solo/masochist*
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: He would probably recommend a group of around 4 people
 DrNukeLear#2414: 
If you’re struggling with imposter syndrome, need advice or just want someone to look at your work and point you in a direction ask around.
If someone asks for art ask them about size, format etc. You can’t be expected to produce art without direction and specification.
 caibi#2508: sus
 BurnV06#5857: Candidate for worst typo of the year 2022
 nekiwo#7574: thank you!! cant wait to see what you guys make as well :)
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: typo
 caibi#2508: no
 birdstone#3073: walrus what
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: lets not
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: that's fair, there is art help availiable for sure in the art team
 caibi#2508: Try to @ mark. lol
 M_Raven#4076: He’s right though
 🎸👶 Guitar Kid#4264: I'm sure he'd say it sounds like a bad idea lmao
 M_Raven#4076: Someone needs to ask Mark what he thinks about me being in a 23-person team
 BurnV06#5857: My team has googolplex members /j
 caibi#2508: make a game like *No Man’s Sky*
 StormyMay#4100: Stop accepting people I'm begging you
 M_Raven#4076: It isnt /j
 Scolon#4218: How is this even going to work lmao
 Capybara#8868: jesus
 birdstone#3073: my name can be rearranged into denial
 M_Raven#4076: Help me
 Scolon#4218: 23 member wtf
 BurnV06#5857: We don’t exist. We’re a figment of your imagination. The crash was 10 years ago. You need to let go.
 StormyMay#4100: All of my circles are people my age so its just easy to get whiplash when you're behind a screen and assume everyone is an adult
 birdstone#3073: oh no
 M_Raven#4076: We’re just concepts, Daniel
 birdstone#3073: wow i don't exist to you??
 caibi#2508: put down your phone, and walk out. you will know that the life is colorful.
 StormyMay#4100: I'm mostly in my comfort zone I think? I've just never been part of a dev team and this is my first jam. All the help feels geared towards new jammers that are devs, not artists
 M_Raven#4076: 
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: You'll be fine, just do what you can and see how you get on
 StormyMay#4100: Something about going to college has genuinely made me forget kids and teens exist sometimes
 M_Raven#4076:  we just went to 23 members
 caibi#2508: I feel bad, my mom don’t let me touch the computer, I can’t practice..
 BurnV06#5857: I want to learn how to program particles tho
 StormyMay#4100: I am fearing for my life actually
 BurnV06#5857: Yeah
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: How are people feeling with a couple of days to go? Has everyone got their tools together and practiced uploading a game?
 caibi#2508: yes, **again**, I just get out from the hell
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: *again?*
 caibi#2508: nah nah, not again
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: shall I mute you just in case lol
 StormyMay#4100: /j just so we are clear
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: What are you planning
 StormyMay#4100: Say something questionable and find out
 caibi#2508: Who is the fastest among the mods
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yeah its good to update a couple of times a day and then a final submission to all the platforms at the end
 BurnV06#5857: I submitted after 3 hours last year
 Scolon#4218: I'm going to submit very early and just keep updating to make sure there's no issue with submissions
I had submission issues last time I participated and lost a ton of time
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Yeah you can change your page look and the text information, just not the files
 BurnV06#5857: I did that twice last year
 BurnV06#5857: More time to work on the update anyways
 Scolon#4218: And you can update your page as many times as you want before the deadline
 BurnV06#5857: Yeah I will
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: please do NOT create a second page for your game. Just have the damn patience to wait a week before updating stuff
 BurnV06#5857: Yeah that’s what I’ll do
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: you can after the ratings finished
 Scolon#4218: Yes you can
 BurnV06#5857: I think you can put multiple download files on one page. I did that with the 1.0 version of Rouge Blaster
 Scolon#4218: But yeah if you're going to have post-jam versions i would recommend either creating a separate page or channel for your game.
Many people may need to play the jam version for various reasons
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: You can update your itch page and the writing there, and you can work on your game outside of the jam but you can't change the game files during the voting
 BurnV06#5857: No I’m fine with waiting until after the jam
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: you could always make a separate page for it if you needed to upload it
 Scolon#4218: I'm pretty sure itch literally won't let you change your  game during the rating period
 BurnV06#5857: Question: is it okay to work on a post-jam update during the rating period as long as you don’t upload it until after the jam ends?
 wren#0640: oh my mistake but yeah thats what i was asking about
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Mark usually steams playing some of the games in the first ratings week. he doens't show himself playing the top 100 no
 wren#0640: does mark still stream himself playing the top 100?
 M_Raven#4076: Mark Brown will log onto his computer and discover a singular game submitted that was worked on by every participant of the jam
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Y'all out here gobbling other game dev teams like the Holy Roman Empire. Lmao.
 TheGameShePlays#7762: hmm, I think on reflection I will stay solo, but maybe have a few ideas ready in my head
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: 5.5%?
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: You will most likely be using one of their scenes by the end. Be sure that they include all the assets. But, try to have too many hands touching a scene. It can cause a bad merge conflict if two level designers touch the same object.
 StormyMay#4100: Its ~5% after some calculatoring
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: it might not be right at all! i just got done with a ttrpg campaign and it's midnight!
 nekiwo#7574: We do have a code reviewer team, and changes will be draft PRs
I like the idea of working on separate scenes 🤔 👍
 StormyMay#4100: Somehow that math doesn't feel right
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: untitled gmtk team xd anthem goes hard.
 ImZary#0765: alright, imma try my luck there
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: That's why I'm saying join up on the team finder and see what happens that way something can potentially happen while you think about stuff so that you don't run out of time
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Assign people dedicated to those things. With 22 people, you can pull someone (or three) to be Git Cop and manage the repository and resolve any and all merge conflicts.
Make sure everyone on your team is working in their own unity scene and their own branches, as well. No toe stepping. Mitigates merge conflicts. And, for the love of god, don't have anyone push changes to main. Lol.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: 22 is just 1% of 400. come on!
 ImZary#0765: that is true, i just need some... time to decide.
but i am slightly worried that if i just keep on taking my time to decide, by the time the jam starts and say i decided to join i won't be able to find a decent team to join 
 M_Raven#4076: Gonna get to the point where we need a team anthem
 TheGameShePlays#7762: well, except for an idea for the soundtrack, but I doubt I'd have time to do that *and* make a game
 TheGameShePlays#7762: I did my last game jam solo but I'd put together a little library of assets that met the rules beforehand so I just had to write up the basic code. This time I can use anything and thus I have no ideas 😅
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Just one or two. Nothing much.
 nekiwo#7574: The biggest thing I'm anxious about is how to approach git collaboration and possibility of merge conflicts or incompatibility issues
I do have some ideas on how to manage it, but I want to hear if you have anything?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i'm riding solo
 M_Raven#4076: ^^^
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: have a look at the team finder you can always choose not to join anyone 
 birdstone#3073: *form your army*
 TheGameShePlays#7762: 😂 oh dear
 ImZary#0765: i mean, i am mostly free, i just need to decide if i wanna go for it (since i joined on like, *3 weeks ago*) yk
 M_Raven#4076: Please no
 DrNukeLear#2414: @maven could do with a couple of new members
 tykenn#8548: If you write in a circle, then you have infinity words, and therefore infinite efficiency
 ImZary#0765: it's fine i guess, i worked on a project of mine and did quite a lot of progress today
thinking about maybe joining the gmtk , still wondering whether i should go for it or not
 TheGameShePlays#7762: I'm just trying to decide if I can be bothered doing a game or if I'd rather throw myself at an existing team for sound/music and hope I feel creative.
 M_Raven#4076: The spin will let us write super long lines that wrap 360 degrees around us
 DrNukeLear#2414: Not bad, you?
 ImZary#0765: f, *i feel you*
 DrNukeLear#2414: How will they code if they’re spinning?
 null_ham#2050: pain
 ImZary#0765: hey pals!
how's life? :D
 M_Raven#4076: I believe most of our team won’t be active for most of the jam though, and I’m thinking of suggesting a “rotating schedule” kinda thing to the coordinators
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: don't misinform people. it's ||pants are for loser||
 DrNukeLear#2414: Jam morale will only decrease when they find out the theme is ||marmalade||
 M_Raven#4076: Nice :D
My team’s doing a “jam-ready” check tomorrow. Essentially just seeing if all systems are working
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Under different circumstances, I would definitely consider it. Lol.
But, I spent a good amount of time hand picking the people I have now.
I wouldn't say they're the best of the best. But, we all know what we're capable of and confidences are already established for the team.
A stunt like that would absolutely knacker morale  and will cause us to drop in size, fast.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: lol
 DrNukeLear#2414: So be it *as Palpatine* (really struggling without the ability to meme)
 M_Raven#4076: *The date is July 15th, 2022. The GTMK Game Jam has just begun, but all of the participants have merged into one super-team.*
 birdstone#3073: you'll never take us alive
 DrNukeLear#2414: Resistance is Futile
 birdstone#3073: *dont you dare try to assimilate my team*
 M_Raven#4076: You are next Daniel
 nekiwo#7574: it might be a deep issue with old code base, the same reason VS2022 is still not on linux
 DrNukeLear#2414: Build me an army worthy of ~~Mordor~~ Mark Brown
 birdstone#3073: *the end is coming*
 M_Raven#4076: **Yes** /j
 jonahhw#9743: (plus I just hate when devs ignore linux like that)
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Become a **33 person** team?
 DrNukeLear#2414: Dew it
 jonahhw#9743: WINE is more general than games (and I think FL is confirmed to work with it), but running through WINE is typically not as good as using a native app
 M_Raven#4076:  Terrible idea: we merge teams
 yugioh#7402: Can't you use wine to run it on Linux or is wine only for games
 jonahhw#9743: Logic is the one that's only on Mac. FL is available on Windows and Mac, but no Linux which I'm salty about as usual
 Light Maker 🍧#8953: Chapter structure, more classic RPG elements, small roster
 Light Maker 🍧#8953: Bravely Default is a big inspiration for what I'm making
 yugioh#7402: Oh i will check Ableton too is fruity loops available on windows because i remember a famous music app is only available on mac
 birdstone#3073: ohhhh i've heard of bravely default
 Light Maker 🍧#8953: Oh I thoguht that was a very famous RPG
 DrNukeLear#2414: I’d have to ask what that is lol
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I don't really do music. I just play guitar. Lol. Our musician uses Ableton and I used to mess around with Fruity Loops a long time ago.
 Light Maker 🍧#8953: I see. I'd have to say it's kinda...wanna say first half of Bravely Default.
 yugioh#7402: I see thx for the advice
 yugioh#7402: I will check it out thx shadow
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: ┬─┬ ノ( ゜-゜ノ)
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: bosca is more soundfount based than actual chiptune
 DrNukeLear#2414: It’s a question of your RPGs style, engine, narrative and design. As well as what you want the player to feel.
Map travel  is better for Epic journeys with gaps between the story.
Getting the player to suffer through ever step of the journey is more immersive and gives your more storytelling opportunities.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Bosca Ceoil
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: guess this could go in sound help, but you can really use any digital art workstation given that you have the correct plug ins to produce the sound - if you want trackers, i know there's a very popular tracker people use
 yugioh#7402: I don't know if this question is appropriate here but what app do any of you use to make chiptune music
 TheGameShePlays#7762: Exactly! I spent a good deal of time once I caught up on story just exploring some of the big Stormblood maps.
 unityAccount#7810: Why not split into 2 or 3 mini-teams and make 2 or 3 games. This way your chances for success will increase 🧠
 Light Maker 🍧#8953: Just asking cause I'm still unsure how I wanna do travel in the RPG I'm making
 SapphireTactics#7972: I also like how 14 connects. I sometimes chill and just walk from Gridiana to Limsa to take a boat to Uldah
 yugioh#7402: For a sec i thought that question would cause a heated debate tbh
 a𝓿𝓸𝓬𝓪𝓭𝓸 𝓹𝓮𝓮𝓵#4117: oh right
 Light Maker 🍧#8953: I mean I don't think it coutns as an RPG
 a𝓿𝓸𝓬𝓪𝓭𝓸 𝓹𝓮𝓮𝓵#4117: does metroid count as open world?
 TheGameShePlays#7762: Same answer either way.
 Light Maker 🍧#8953:  
Not talkin about 3D, talkin about 2D
 TheGameShePlays#7762: I like how FF14 does it - they're interconnecting locations but some of them are pretty big (as big as what ever the lowest console supported in that expansion allowed).
 Wolf'1988 🐺⚔#1859: Best open world in my opinion is Witcher 3. The environment told a  story which many open worlds fail to do. It felt war torn etc
 Hobusu#5033: I'm more used to Pokémon style though since I grew up with that series
 Hobusu#5033: Both have their strengths and weaknesses
 Teslobo#8274: I like A but generally not the way that FF does it
 Light Maker 🍧#8953: I see I see
 birdstone#3073: i always liked worlds where places are interconnected and there's always more than one way to go to reach a place
 Light Maker 🍧#8953: Out of curiosity, which do you guys prefer more in an RPG
A: An Overworld that connects major areas together
B: Inter-connecting locations that you walk between different zones to reach
So basically
Final Fantasy, or Pokemon
 Mattstov(Matt) ⃤#8596: im probably gonna end up working alone
 birdstone#3073: cue excessive arguing
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: The main thing that stops large games working is not having a single person to be the point of call for everything and to co-ordinate everything
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: my team name is "it takes a village to raise a child and it takes a ewe to make a game"
 Mattstov(Matt) ⃤#8596: mine is overscoped
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Sounds like you're in the Nile.
 birdstone#3073: my team name is denial
 Mattstov(Matt) ⃤#8596: lmfao
 GodOfPro#7302: oh didn't know that lol
 birdstone#3073: *oh i didn't know stormy was a name*
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: We use GitHub. But, Unity Collab is gone, I thought, and replaced with Plastic SCM.
 birdstone#3073: gmtk jam slowly becoming masterchef
 StormyMay#4100: I think you're officially the first person to correctly assume stormy refers to weather and not the common name stormy
 Mattstov(Matt) ⃤#8596: im a team of 1 as of right now
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: immediately thinking about too many cooks now
 birdstone#3073: i thought they migrated?
 GodOfPro#7302: do you guys unity collaborator to work with a team ?
 Michel#2879: rare coconut sounds like a company name tbh
 birdstone#3073: thats better lmao
 StormyMay#4100: So right so true
 Michel#2879: Rare coconut
 Mattstov(Matt) ⃤#8596: sunny june
 birdstone#3073: StormyMay's greatest rival: StormyJune
 StormyMay#4100: Something something how many programmers does it take to screw in a light bulb joke
 Mattstov(Matt) ⃤#8596: WHAT!?!?!?
 M_Raven#4076: We do have artists and a musician we’re just mostly programmers
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Did you miss the part where the other team has ***22 team members?*** Lol.
 DrNukeLear#2414: The Vibers?
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: #TeamStormy
 Mattstov(Matt) ⃤#8596: god damn thats alot
 M_Raven#4076: *Too many programmers*
_Nah, no-one will ever have this many people_
 nekiwo#7574: sure
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: What's your team comp?
We got: 3 artists, 4 programmers, 2 designers, 1 playtester and 1 musician.
 Michel#2879: want me to suggest a name?
 StormyMay#4100: We also don't have a team name lmao, I think our whole team is simply vibing and happy to be here
 M_Raven#4076: Part of me feels like we have so many programmers on hand that there’s gonna be some people who aren’t gonna commit at all because all the files are already being worked on
 StormyMay#4100: The dream, live your best life ig
 Michel#2879: I just texted a random phone number
"mon, i accidentally threw my little brother from the window"
 birdstone#3073: literally starting a game company
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: That's all you need, really. Lol.
 nekiwo#7574: commiting to the unity project repo will be a PAIN
 StormyMay#4100: Bro you need team leads and a supervisor at that point
 birdstone#3073: for some reason this is really funny to me
 M_Raven#4076: We have a trello board and a dream
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Bet
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: you dont just need a team manager you need a COUNCIL of team managers, yeesh
 M_Raven#4076: 22v11 us come on
 nekiwo#7574: i can 100% get more people but i think its gonna get unmanagable
 birdstone#3073: you guys are really out here forming an army huh
 M_Raven#4076: I just checked again, **we’re up to 22**
I think most of us aren’t gonna be active for 100% of the jam but uhhhhh
 birdstone#3073: what
 nekiwo#7574: we have 21 members now lol (if thats what 17 means(
 birdstone#3073: lol yeah, my current one is the icon of my app
 nekiwo#7574: did you also change pfp
i think i remember a daniel
 birdstone#3073: i don't think i saw what you made but i remember you commented on mine
 nekiwo#7574: 👀 omg
 birdstone#3073: oh i think i remember you from last year too
 nekiwo#7574: untitled gmtk team xd
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: What's your team name?
 nekiwo#7574: ?
 birdstone#3073: *both teams get singlehandedly destroyed by a soloing 7 year old prodigy*
 M_Raven#4076:  you heard this man
 M_Raven#4076: Yep
 birdstone#3073: i tried speedrunning your jam game last year lmao
 M_Raven#4076: Shadow Cloak speedrun any% glitchless
 M_Raven#4076: Too late, start cloaking
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Oh damn. Best of luck. I stopped bringing people on once we hit 11 team members. Lol.
 M_Raven#4076: ?
 DrNukeLear#2414: Just put the board in charge.
 GodOfPro#7302: oh got it thanks
 StormyMay#4100: General rule of thumb: when asking, if you think "this is probably okay" then its probably okay, if you think "this feels wrong but I'm gonna ask" maybe just dont
 wren#0640: .
 M_Raven#4076: It’s ok we have a Trello board and our sheer will /j
 birdstone#3073: try to avoid making things beforehand specifically for the jam, it's not *illegal* but its against the jam spirit
 GodOfPro#7302: is it ok to create some generic systems before the jam like a dialogue system
 Sherbert Lemon#8177: lmao wow
 birdstone#3073: **lets not talk about how our game title was mispelled yet nobody noticed**
 M_Raven#4076: Aminus stands for A minus
 DrNukeLear#2414: You need a strong team leader and split into development cells.
 birdstone#3073: ohhh boy, i hope you guys will be able to coordinate well
 birdstone#3073: lol maybe just a good presence
 M_Raven#4076: We uh, we ended up growing to a team of 17. I don’t think this’ll work out well
 birdstone#3073: damn, ours is 1 programmer 1 musician and 1 artist
 samcox08#6606: My goal is to be involved with more game jams in the future.
 wren#0640: ive gotten recognised like twice and i didnt even submit last year lol
 birdstone#3073: SHADOW cloak
 StormyMay#4100: Our team is 6- two coders, two artists, 1 sound, and 1 dedicated playtester
 M_Raven#4076: No one remembers me 💀
I did change my username and profile pic though
 birdstone#3073: lol yeah, unfortunately i couldn't fix the slowmotion bugs in time since i was having a really bad headache
I remember how clean your graphics were in unreal
 SlingingPlant145#5532: Oh, yeah, I remember the game you made last year! Got to say, I was impressed by how polished yours was, given the 48 hour time limit.
 JuliusCube#8501: hello im also a cube who was here last year
 birdstone#3073: i think one of the artists for binding of isaac antibirth/repentance is on that team? notyoursaggitarius i think
 birdstone#3073: yeah i looked at your profile picture and was like "hey wait i've seen this somewhere before" and i checked our dms
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: if you check these all have great thumbnail art - because that is the entire job of one of the artists on the team
 birdstone#3073: yooo those guys made static cling
 SlingingPlant145#5532: To be honest, I'm surprised anyone remembered the game I made last year.
 SlingingPlant145#5532: : D
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: it depends on the jam as well and what you are going for. Having 1 artist on backgrounds and one on characters could be really helpful
 birdstone#3073: YOOOOO I REMEMBER YOU FROM YOUR PROFILE PICTURE
two cubes
 Scolon#4218: Well in a game jam scenario the designer can fill all of those roles I think
 unityAccount#7810: Yeah, the members shouldn't care about whose idea makes it to the final game more than the quality of the product. The decision should be left to the leader/designer.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: could be designer, playtester, writer, a lot of people could be in that last slot
 Scolon#4218: 1 designer
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: 1 programmer, 1 artist, 1 sound person, 1 wild card
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: the large teams that are successful have really strong leads who have experience with groups and are the final say on all decisions
 JuliusCube#8501: i find it funny how the name of the role "mark**s**"  implies the existence of other marks such as mark black, mark white, mark orange, and mark green.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: generally people in teams of around 4 people
 Fraserfatt#1021: producer role is also nice
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: this is an executive manager i think - a role a lot of people think is just sitting down and looking at people do stuff but it's actually really key in making sure everyone is making something that comes together into something cohesive
 unityAccount#7810: An important role in teams would be a team leader who listens to all ideas, takes the decisions and organises the team
 Squishy Turtle#3988: Yeah I’d love to do a full release eventually!
 wren#0640: i really need to figure out godots particle system
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: hmmm... i think if i had one self-imposed focus this time around i think it would be making the game juicy
 JuliusCube#8501: i always work solo in jams, i cant imagine how 11 person teams can make anything that is understandable in 2 days.
 randall#2501: 4 people with set tasks is realistically the max for most I'd think
 Aitesedbaن#6908: yea large teams seem difficult, especially with getting one coherent and simple vision
 SaadTheGlad#9716: I was in a very big team temporarily one jam and nothing came our of it due to terrible organization
 SaadTheGlad#9716: That's the thing, the dont
 SlingingPlant145#5532: Is there an average team size? From what some of the people in here are saying, it sounds like some groups have 8-11 people in their team, and coming from someone who worked solo last year, I have a hard time understanding how groups that large could realistically work together for a 48 hour game jam. 🤔
 JuliusCube#8501: you just dont use milliseconds and you approximate
 Aitesedbaن#6908: how do you sync the timer to the exact moment the game starts if it's external?
 Space_Farmer#9620: im that guy lol
 Lyfe#8258: Thanks I don't know where I got it from
 SaadTheGlad#9716: And I do remember you
 JuliusCube#8501: any lunatic that would decided to run a jam game would probably be using an external timer though.
 Lyfe#8258: Basically, instead of the really grating jump sound or coin collecting sound, it does the same sound but pitched up or down on a pentatonic scale, so it's less repetitive, maybe it goes up in the scale starting from the bottom to suggest combos, but that doesn't work for long combos and also might get annoying
 SaadTheGlad#9716: Thank you, and yes I was in last year's  jam
 randall#2501:  cool avatar btw
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: that would definitely be an interesting challenge
 Lyfe#8258: Oh I thought of a way of making sound effects less annoying, but i have no idea how to implement it
 samcox08#6606: I've got 35% left.
 samcox08#6606: I'm working on a Unity 2D course.
 JuliusCube#8501: last time i made a game i decided to speedrun it, im thinking of (maybe) putting a speedrun timer on the game i make for this jam.
 JuliusCube#8501: i already have done that. it is incredibly helpful.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: no it wouldn't, based on how it wasn't funny the last 2 years
 Scolon#4218: Friendly reminder to consider downloading the itch.io app! It will automatically handle downloadable games for you so you don't have to manually manage files.
 JuliusCube#8501: it happened last year
 Redline#7370: that would be really funny tbh
 JuliusCube#8501: it will crash 1 hour before the deadlline
 Hobusu#5033: There was at least one year where it never crashed!
 Redline#7370: sounds about right
 JuliusCube#8501: whatever youll end up making yollie will still call it minecraft
 Viola_Buddy#6763: (Incidentally, idol games are right out.)
 Redline#7370: not planning to but it depends on the theme
 Scolon#4218: Yeah same
 JuliusCube#8501: are you going to make minecraft again for this jam?
 RapterChance#8883: Any bets on how fast itch will crash this year?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: maybe don't
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I think it's always good to try a mix of stuff, I want to get into 3D eventually but I have too much to learn in 2D first
 JuliusCube#8501: okay i guess so then
 Redline#7370: no like on youtube
 JuliusCube#8501: no thank you
only in 
 yugioh#7402: I've been awake for nearly 36 hours i don't feel asleep yet
 Redline#7370: I only did 3D for most of my gamedev carrier, only recently started doing 2D more seriously
 Viola_Buddy#6763: That's possible. I use "strategy" very broadly; idle games would fit.
That said, idle games would require me to figure out timers. More possible than animations, but threading and callbacks are always a nightmare to debug
 JuliusCube#8501: i have:
and:
apparently theyre pretty good i dont really know though.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I really only work in 2D, genre for me isn't so important but I do enjoy simple mechanics
 JuliusCube#8501: i did not expect an idea this simple to be this complex
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: have you considered an idle game?
 Redline#7370: everyone should spam something really stupid in chat when the theme gets revealed
 Scolon#4218: Chat loses their mind
 Scolon#4218: The theme reveal is always so hype
 Viola_Buddy#6763: By the nature of me doing this in pure Javascript/HTML/CSS and not an established game engine, I'm very likely to do a strategy game. Or maybe puzzle. It'll have to be something without animations as an essential part of the gameplay, because I'm not writing my own animation engine in vanilla Javascript in two days, unless it's something super simple.
 yugioh#7402: Oh boy i can't wait for the video on the game jam
 JohnLivingston#4642: Dude, this is really damn cool! Love the concept and tone. It seems so deceptively simple at first but becomes such a complex, fun puzzler. Are you shooting for a full release?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: check the itch page, there's a timer down to the second
 JuliusCube#8501: in 3 days
also were you in another gmtk jam or brackeys jam by any chance
 Redline#7370: 3 days
 SaadTheGlad#9716: When is the game jam btw
 Scolon#4218: Kept my game in the oven for too long, it burned to a crisp
 JuliusCube#8501: gonna be looking forward to whatever masterpiece and/or mess of a game (depending on how you handle team management) your team manages to cook up for the jam
 Scolon#4218: I'm always going to do something action-oriented with arcade elements I think
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: replayed the itch game i made for my last jam, honestly my first criticism is that the game doesn't have enough juice in the combat. it feels very stiff
 JuliusCube#8501: puzzle/something similar to puzzle because i like puzzles
 LOLGuy213#7361: I prefer to *not* do turn based games, as the logic can get too weird for me to handle and turn priority can be hard to deal in such a small timeframe
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: sounds good
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: *If they're still awake...*
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Oh, just chillin! Trying to wrap up my work day so I can go home and try to coordinate/communicate with my team.
 JuliusCube#8501: okay i guess i can make some more basic scripts for movement, camera follow, etc. that I can use when the jam starts instead of making them from scratch.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: sup
 AquaduckStudio#0780: SPACE themed!!!
 samcox08#6606: Does anyone have a preferred genre to develop the jam game in?
 yugioh#7402: Hi shadow
 AquaduckStudio#0780: okay, fair point
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: that's not actually correct because how many of those 16k are in teams
 Scolon#4218: Yeah it's somewhere around 30-40% submission rate I think
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: My guess is that we'll have between 18-20k people joined and 5-8k games submitted
 JuliusCube#8501: most people compete in teams so its less than that
 Hobusu#5033: You can probably check the video from last year to find out how many people joined
 AquaduckStudio#0780: even if 5k out of 16k for example, that's a 66% fail rate to deliver a game
 JuliusCube#8501: i cant see from the jam page
 birdstone#3073: i forgot
 AquaduckStudio#0780: how many joined?
 AquaduckStudio#0780: WOW really? okay ill eat my words. thats a lot
 JuliusCube#8501: bro last year it was 5.7k no way its gonna be 900
 birdstone#3073: last year we had around 5000 submitted
 AquaduckStudio#0780: 48 hours is brutal
 birdstone#3073: i'm sure that'll be fine
 AquaduckStudio#0780: i would bet ~900 games get submitted
 JuliusCube#8501: id say 6k will
 AquaduckStudio#0780: 16k people signed up.
i bet less than 1k submit a game
 JuliusCube#8501: why?
 Scolon#4218: I also wrote a simple script, in like 5 minutes, that builds, zips, and deploys my game to the itch.io page automatically with the press of one button. That wouldn't be against the spirit of the jam right? I'm probably gonna use it for like all future projects anyways. I haven't wrote any game logic, just making sure my project is configured correctly so I'm not spending a huge chunk of dev time stressing out about not being able to submit.
 AquaduckStudio#0780: if you can actually submit a game in the end, you pretty much won in my book
 JuliusCube#8501: yeah but you cant really practice for that, thats just a thing that comes naturally
 AquaduckStudio#0780: creativity and problem solving
 samcox08#6606: I'll admit that the experience of jamming is not as exciting as it used to be for me but it's nice to have a game out.
 AquaduckStudio#0780: it is a very powerful tool. reminds me a lot of Warcraft 3 trigger system
 JuliusCube#8501: what do you guys think is most important in practicing for a jam?
 JuliusCube#8501: that being said Ive only really practiced making music because thats what im worst at
 AquaduckStudio#0780: im sorry i guess technically i use Game Creator 1. 2 is the beta right?
 GodOfPro#7302: the visual scripting looks more polished than unity one
 GodOfPro#7302: i have seen it and it seems very cool
 AquaduckStudio#0780: <-- this guy
 GodOfPro#7302: does anyone use game creator 2 ?
 yugioh#7402: Congrats both of you
 AquaduckStudio#0780: wow nice
 JuliusCube#8501: i got 4th in innovation in ldjam once
 yugioh#7402: Cool
 AquaduckStudio#0780: i got 4th place one time on cosmic jam for most enjoyable game 😊
 Sapient#3138: Nice nice
 Scolon#4218: Well I just saved like 5 hours of jam time by verifying that my builds will work properly
 JuliusCube#8501: the problem with planning is that im too lazy to do it. and when I do plan stuff i end up not following the plan.
Im better off just practicing instead of planning
 MinionGames#6674: that's what always happens as programmers
 yugioh#7402: Good night
I didn't even change anything
 JuliusCube#8501: I did great on 7 day jams though
like for example i got top 50 in one brackeys jam and top 250 the other that I attended
 AquaduckStudio#0780: planning is *crucial*
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: that's a common problem
 theChief#0001: That was my entry to GMTK 2020! That was a fun one 😂
 JuliusCube#8501: last time i did a 2 day jam I messed up really badly because my idea was too difficult to construct
 Scolon#4218: oh great, my webgl build just completely stopped working 😶
 DrNukeLear#2414: Nite
 DrNukeLear#2414:  there is a simple pleasure you get from yeeting down hills.
 birdstone#3073: good night
 dardasaba#9759: Good night people!
 Squishy Turtle#3988: thanks goes to  for showing me how to do sprite stacking on the title
 JohnLivingston#4642: These all look super cool, I’ll check them out now 😄
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: the game jam i made dead fusion in i wasted so much time making a save system (which was entirely unnecessary), and sunk a lot of time in the art. i'm glad i spent so much time in the art though, i actually think presentation is the strongest element of this game
 birdstone#3073: the title bobbing is mesmerizing to me lmao
 birdstone#3073: that is such a beautiful but simple artstyle
 MinionGames#6674: last time I did a 7-day jam, but ended up wasting like 4 days of it and had to make it in three days lol
 birdstone#3073: lol yeah, i love that mix of 2d and 3d
 birdstone#3073: i've gotten used to doing hand drawn animation for games
 theChief#0001: Same! There's a bit of neon glowy in Gustavo Go too, but not quite so much xD
 birdstone#3073: WOOOO, idk i just love neon glowy art
 theChief#0001: Means I don't have to think about art
 theChief#0001: I'll be going for something similar this jam 😂 it's nice and straightforward tbh
 birdstone#3073: lmao it's amazing
 LOLGuy213#7361: You can upload it once you have a working version, but itch gets a Bit Slow (unresponsive to requests) when it gets to the end of the jam period, so I recommend just having a boilerplate one done beforehand that you can just immediately add an upload to, set public and submit for the jam
 theChief#0001: It's my typical art style lol
 birdstone#3073: oh my god i love the artstyle for neon barrage
 theChief#0001: I'll give this a go in the morning when I'm out of bed 😁
 samcox08#6606: I'm hoping one day to extend my work to pixel art and other styles.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: it's a downloadable - and it has quite a few bugs
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Generally those would be on people's itch.io so feel free to give your itch username or your game name but lets not turn this room into a wall of links thanks
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Do I have to make a placeholder project as per the pinned message, or can I just upload it once I've got a working version
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: eh, you know what, sure, i'd love to get more feedback on it
 JohnLivingston#4642: Just to play!
 Tyrix#6647: to play or to inspect the project?
 birdstone#3073: you can check out "aminus" which is mine from last year's gmtk, i'm still pretty proud of that one
 JohnLivingston#4642: Anyone have any past game jam projects to share?? I’m taking a break from work and would love to check some out 👀
 samcox08#6606: The first and longest one I've done is about 5 days.
 randall#2501: 48 hour jams are great for demos lol
 birdstone#3073: lmao ive only ever done 48 hour jams and still manage to survive
 AquaduckStudio#0780: i did  72 hour one recently. short deadlines are brutal
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yes
 GodOfPro#7302: in this channel ?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: yes
 AquaduckStudio#0780: this one is 48 hours right
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Best of luck; there's some resources pinned that might help you out a bit
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: seven day jams are good to get a pulse on how to work within a jam but my god it was also very stressful
 MinionGames#6674: I did the weekly game jam 258 in June, so this will be my second time ever attending one
 AquaduckStudio#0780: I've got a good game idea- You're a frog, but you're afraid of water. so you have to get water to stay alive, but also water will kill you.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: my last jam was around a year ago
 randall#2501: I havent done a Jam in like a year or two; so Im super stoked. Especially now that Im learning Unity, I hope I help with that and not just music this time.
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: I'm bored lol
 birdstone#3073: this is also my third jam
 MinionGames#6674: thanks
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Thanks 🙂!
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: also you're responsible for half the messages in this channel so slow mode seems pretty justified
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: third jam. first big time jam tho - never had this many partecipants
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: ah ok nice!
 MinionGames#6674: it's also my first jam
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: wdym?
 LOLGuy213#7361: **memories of gmtk jam 2021 and previous jams hype channels**
 MinionGames#6674: here also
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: ah ok
 Hobusu#5033: Especially when the Jam starts and around the end of the submission window
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: very
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: I've never done a jam before so idk how busy it gets lol
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Ok 😀
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yeah asking for the cooldown to be lowered is usually not a good way to make that happen. We do lower or raise it as we see fit depending on what is going on and how many mods are around
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: oh lol
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: the help channels and the jam discussion channels don't seem to have a slowmode at all
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: yeah but I mean before the jam or in quiet times to like 5s
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: absolutely not, when this server starts talking there are A LOT of people talking at once
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: dude can they turn down the message cooldown time
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Yes you can upload as many platforms as you want
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: I think so yeah
 GodOfPro#7302: can i upload both a webgl build and a windows build for the jam ?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: not sure if that increased
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: lol
 AquaduckStudio#0780: i recently learned that there are 14 different dialects of Spanish, and the one they teach us in highschool, and google translate, are castilian and basically worthless
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: brainfuck language - look it up on YouTube it's cool
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: Im tired of editing 3gb footage
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: also how many entries are expected?
 AquaduckStudio#0780: bf like boyfriend? or butterfinger
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: have you guys heard of the bf programming language
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: When making a devlog, should you record in sessions?
 AquaduckStudio#0780: old skool. i like it
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: scratch is better tbh
 birdstone#3073: nah i use notepad and ms paint
 AquaduckStudio#0780: anyone use Game Creator for Unity?
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: oki
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: usually anyway
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: igpus have encoding hardware
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: *Presses Submit; Dies.*
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: I don't have a GPU in my craptop
 Hobusu#5033: I'm gonna say you have to live for it to count, lol
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: have you tried gpu hardware encoding?
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: hope not lol I want to be restricted
 L3mmy♡#2307: Imagine if theme of the game jam is "Game" x3
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: I also found another thing with making devlogs - my computer lags a lot when using unity and obs
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: noice
 Redline#7370: I like how by just being here I already gained like 7 subscribers this is nice
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: lmao
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: what if the theme was just "grapes"
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: I think the theme should be boss fight and you have to create the most ultimate satisfying screenshake boss fight
 Fraserfatt#1021: unless you had amazing modular assets you just slap in
 Hobusu#5033: Also it's not like a AAA game could really be finished by one person, there are too many parts
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: yea
 Redline#7370: someone would definetly notice the way higher quality compared to other games
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: imagine you've almost finished a AAA game and join that jam for the last part
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: there _is_ a 'finish your projects' jam but i can't remember what it's called
 Hobusu#5033: Because 76 people don't realize YouTube has a notification feature for the start of premieres
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Top comment: "The theme is finish the game you started last year". I wasn't even here last year lol
 Redline#7370: hmm
 DrNukeLear#2414: They’ve been there for 24 hours.
 Redline#7370: why are there 76 people watching?
 Scolon#4218: Just realized i posted in wrong chat, but oh well lmao
 Scolon#4218: that's the theme reveal video
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: not on my craptop lol
 Fraserfatt#1021: that's how I'm tryna be 😎
 birdstone#3073: webgl raytracing
 LOLGuy213#7361: Yeah, last year our unity WebGL game which was a 3d fps game didn't run brilliant but ran fine in an executable
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: def looking forward to them switching to webgpu whenever that happens
 Redline#7370: that was an issue to me once, and it took a long time to fix
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: my drone game is going well. I have basic flying and you can shoot lasers and break buildings (it gets laggy though with all the rigidbodies)
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: it can be prone to memory leaks
 Fraserfatt#1021: but most times you'll be fine
 Redline#7370: step 1. Turn off build compression
step 2. always do build + run
step 3. google issues
 Zoro5168#0115: u gotta do what u gotta do for those ratings
 Fraserfatt#1021: webgl + asset store stuff = possible disaster in my experience
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: yea - it could just be overdramatic youtubers
 birdstone#3073: i've only had one nightmare when building webgl but other than that one time it's normally very smooth for me
 Redline#7370: in Unity?
 SixGames#0399: hello
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: isn't Web gl like really inconsistent and buggy with builds tho? I always hear horror stories about building Web gl
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: oki
 Redline#7370: yes
 dardasaba#9759: If you can, yes
 birdstone#3073: probably a good idea, those typically get more ratings
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: should I make a Web gl build for my game
 Ibra#8468: I think there might be someone that made a browser sfxr maybe
 Zoro5168#0115: Ok
 birdstone#3073: oh i always used the one for windows
 Ibra#8468: I don't think so, not the official sfxr atleast
 birdstone#3073: last year my composer used fl studio i think he's gonna use logic pro this year
 randall#2501: I mostly use ableton, but reaper is super good for free.
 dardasaba#9759: Isn't sfxr on browser? (At least the version I'm familiar with)
 Ibra#8468: Audacity for sound editing, don't make music tho
 Ibra#8468: you're welcome 😄
 Zoro5168#0115: Hey what software do u guys use to make music and edit sound
 birdstone#3073: you have saved me from certain doom god bless you
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Dot ***WHOA!***
 Ibra#8468: use bfxr! it has a Mac thing iirc
 birdstone#3073: most likely i have to record sounds which is doable with my microphone but a bit more tedious
 birdstone#3073: lol i'm at a disadvantage for sounds this year since i'm on a mac so i can't use sfxr
 Ibra#8468: also hi wok
 Zoro5168#0115: Ok
 bisho#1824: well i will check it out now, thanks
 Ibra#8468: the entirety of Unity Learn is surprisingly pleasant actually
 Wokarol#0940: Damn... I'm fecked then
 Zoro5168#0115: If u cant do art just use primitive shapes and add post processing and particle system
 birdstone#3073: i think he put the soundtrack on his youtube
 birdstone#3073: definitely, i put together some simple 16 bit sounds and my friend composed a really good soundtrack in the time allotted
 Ibra#8468: create with code is great for beginners ^^
 Zoro5168#0115: All of it still helps to work in 2d
 bisho#1824: I do 2D stuff tho because I'm not really that good with 3D
 Wokarol#0940: Do you use audio?
 Zoro5168#0115: Go binge it rn its really good to give u all basics of coding its on learn.unity. com
 bisho#1824: no
 Zoro5168#0115: Have u watched create with code course
 bisho#1824: ik
 bisho#1824: yep
 Zoro5168#0115: U use unity?
 birdstone#3073: which is good lol, there's a lot of skilled developers you can talk to
 bisho#1824: that's kind if the main reason I'm here tbh
 BadPiggy#5202: Frik, how did I not see it before lol.
Everyone here was saying that Adam was a gamedev YouTuber and I didn't recognise his logo at first lol
 birdstone#3073: ^^this is a good plan
 birdstone#3073: dw you can always ask for help too
 bisho#1824: I litarally couldn't finish a space invaders clone 😂
 birdstone#3073: **i have an obsession with visual polish**
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: If you're totally frozen for a game idea for your first few game jams, I recommend trying to find an old arcade game that you can add a twist to to meet the theme. Picking a game where most of the design work is already done for you saves you a huge amount of time and work, and you get to focus on the unique angle of your game
 Wokarol#0940: Okay, that's pretty well.
Teach me master
 birdstone#3073: lol i meant keep your concept and style simple so you can focus more on making things fun to play
 bisho#1824: bugs aren't usually simple lol
 birdstone#3073: that's fine, just keep things simple and you'll be able to finish
 bisho#1824: ah
 Zoro5168#0115: Same
 birdstone#3073: its an internal win for myself lol
 bisho#1824: I literally just started 6 months ago and didn't finish any game lol
 birdstone#3073: top 50 but not top 20 lol
 Wokarol#0940: Did you win tho?
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: A huge amount of people don't download games (for a variety of reasons) - if your game can be played online in-browser, you'll get a lot more traffic than if you only have a downloadable file
 Zoro5168#0115: Most people tend to play in browser than download cuz theyre lazy
 Wokarol#0940: But jokes aside, there is no requirement. If you want to get better ranking you just gotta be better than others.
But Dot[wo] advice is good
 birdstone#3073: hey i had like three years of experience and did pretty well
 bisho#1824: what's the webgl part about? does my kind of build affect the rating?
 Wokarol#0940: Oh, then at least 8 years and 3 published games. These people are good
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: Partly from their karma score (although I don't know for sure if that's still around), and partly because a link to your game will appear beside your profile name when you rate/comment on other games (so easily visibility)
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: If you want a good opportunity for your game to score highly, you mean?
My advice would be:
- add a webgl build that can be played online
- get to the fun part of your game quickly
- play and  rate a lot of other games; itch.io makes your game more visible if you rate other games
 birdstone#3073: i just look for something fun that fits the theme in a creative way, i did well last year so that's what i'd say
 bisho#1824: I don't really know how to properly phrase it but like what is the rating for the games gets decided on with
 bisho#1824: that's not what I mean, I mean if I want to rank a bit high like what are the things I should be looking at for example
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: can confirm yes. unless they've fixed it from last year
 Wokarol#0940: None
 randall#2501:  jinx
 randall#2501: i believe anyone can join
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: afaik
 Wokarol#0940: Even teammates?
 bisho#1824: sup guys I was wondering how much experience with gamedev do you have to have in order to be able to compete?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: This helps makes sure more games get seen and reviewed
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: anyone who doesn't upload a game will have to review some random games before they can choose ones
 Wokarol#0940: Is the issue with only uploader being able to vote fixed?
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: It's absolutely worth reading the **Submitting a game** section on the itch page if you haven't, there are some specific bits of info that are critical to know 👍
 bisho#1824: yoooo
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: you just need at least 1 team member to have an itch account and join the jam so that they can put the game up and link them together. The whle group doesn't have to have one if they don't want to
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: True dat.
 Alex Silva#8787: dont know man... it broke after break only one ice, not a very good product
 jschwitzer#0421: alright, thanks for the info!
 Scolon#4218: Yeah
 jschwitzer#0421: on itch.io?
 Scolon#4218: No you just add them as collaborators/contributors or whatever on your game's page
 jschwitzer#0421: does my team have to register anywhere?
 DrNukeLear#2414: The ice was a better Titanic breaker.
 yugioh#7402: Ba ba bum
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I think the Titanic is a pretty good ice breaker.
 yugioh#7402: Yeah i just said what it was because i didn't know what to say I'm bad at starting conversations
 randall#2501: lol i know I thought it was funny
 yugioh#7402: Dw there aren't that's was just a toy story reference
 randall#2501: oh god I hope not
 yugioh#7402: Howdy partner is there's a snake in your boot
 randall#2501: howdy
 Scolon#4218: hunger
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: The one where you're hungry.
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: i’m just wondering what type of hunger games you meant
 birdstone#3073: lol if only
 Wokarol#0940: Oh...
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: with weapons? in real life?
 birdstone#3073: wait i'm remembering i feel like i saw a video similar to that
 Wokarol#0940: I think someone did that... multiple times. Right? On a smaller scale
 birdstone#3073: different colors for each year's jam ig lol
 89o#5368: Nah the logo
 birdstone#3073: if you're talking about the role they're a patron
 89o#5368: Why is it orange?
 DrNukeLear#2414: It’s all about the journey.
 birdstone#3073: this is a great idea
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: game dev youtuber hunger games
 Wokarol#0940: And even better lesson on teamwork or something
 Lawn#1538: Get them in the octagon
 Wokarol#0940: Which would be a great video
 birdstone#3073: 🍿
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: I genuinely think we'd end up trying to murder eachother
 birdstone#3073: our game name last year was mispelled but nobody seemed to have noticed
 yugioh#7402: Only legends know the reference
 yugioh#7402: It's an yzma amzy situation
 Wokarol#0940: YEAH! Imagine doing that and not winning your own jam tho, would be kinda awkward
 birdstone#3073: lmao fearal is a great mispelling
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: hahahah I love misspelling origin stories
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: Have you ever seen Adam and Mark in the same room before?
I ain't sayin' nuffin', but... 👀
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: between that and "the architect of games" I've got a knack for terrible pseudonyms
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: So it was originally the feral carrot for reasons that are too mired in personal history to explain and there's already someone out there called theferalcarrot apparently so I just spelt it wrong
 DrNukeLear#2414: What if you and Mark collaborated on a game for a game jam?
 birdstone#3073: actually out of curiosity how did you get the name Thefearalcarrot
Just think of the clicks
"N youtube game designers try to make a game together [Gone Wild]"
 yugioh#7402: His name is Adam i thought his name was carrot I'm bamboozled
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: people have been trying to peer pressure me into stopping youtube for years and look how well that worked out for them
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: I've tried pressuring Adam into admitting he's the imposter before
The guy is unflappable. It ain't happening.
 Wokarol#0940: At some point it could work, and if it did, it would be amazing
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Idk how successful our attempts to peer pressure Adam into game dev are going to be. Lol.
 Wokarol#0940: Fair, but I think every game design youtuber should do that.
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: people are having trouble finding teams? man, I went on team finder and the first guy I DMed is now in my team
 BadPiggy#5202: Ah man, speaking of Mark.
Maybe have another combat design video ?
 Lawn#1538: I adult, I adult.
 yugioh#7402: Oh yeah i forgot it's an honor to meet you 
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: That's not true! I did all of my team finding *outside* of GMTK, for once!
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: developing is his thing
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Please I copy mark enough
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: I've been here for years, how am I only just learning about this??
 Wokarol#0940: Wait, you didn't?
Don't you have a game design youtube channel?
Time to do the Mark
 BadPiggy#5202: F
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: sorry. everyone was asking question and i wanted to feel included
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: No, I meant someone elses team! Lol.
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: for the purposes of legality no i have not stolen the declaration of independence and replaced it with a nearly identical forgery
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: where in the world is carmen sandiego?
 Lawn#1538: You already have 11 members shadow.
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Have you stolen the Declaration of Independence?
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: You could join a team as a designer!
 BadPiggy#5202: Oh cool. That still counts as game design kek
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: I'm bad at coding so I've not made any *video*games but I've dabbled in designing a few RPG systems and cardgames in my time
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Have you ever considered it?
 BadPiggy#5202: Have you done any gamedev ? Just asking
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Nope!
 BadPiggy#5202: Lol. Execution is what really matters here
Arrgghh
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Hey, Adam. Have you ever participated in a game Jam?
 BadPiggy#5202: Ah. Got ya
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: in fighting games to block you hold either back or down and back respective to where your character is facing
 Wokarol#0940: Actually, it would be trivial to teach to people and could introduce replayability **if done right**
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Well if you finish early you can avoid the rush of everyone all trying to submit as the time runs out but so long as you upload *something* in case of the worst you'll be fine
 GodOfPro#7302: brackeys my savior
 BadPiggy#5202: As much as I love FURi, a game like that would not work as a jam game lol
 GodOfPro#7302: even tough i am a beginner to unity i will just learn the bare basics and test out with webgl and build before the jam and then google the rest of the jam
 Wokarol#0940: Yes, "press button when thingy goes bling"
 BadPiggy#5202: " hold back " as in ?
 Michel#2879: Oh. Is it a good idea tho?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: intuitive can depend here - if you asked me to block i would hold back, if you ask a zelda player they might try to hold another button to hold a shield up
 Lawn#1538: I think it depends how it’s implemented. Like if the block slows me down, then it breaks my flow. But dodge/dash always keeps the flow going. If you can parry then at least that keeps the flow going.
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: your final upload as per the deadline will be taken as your submission
 Hannes#5054: nice
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Yes you can!
 Michel#2879: Guys If I upload in the first day of the jam Can I still update it in the second day?
Just trying to make sure im on time and I don't fuck up the entire thing at the last hour
 Hannes#5054: Hello Guys! :D
 BadPiggy#5202: That's probably my favourite defensive mechanic in a game, though would definitely be impossible for people to get in a game jam lol
 BadPiggy#5202: You mean like parries in FURi ?
 Wokarol#0940: Block probably, unless both have QTE style of execution
 BadPiggy#5202: Just that I'm sure every action game in the jam would have a dodge mechanic, so actually having an intuitive block mechanic as your primary defensive option would make you stand out heavily lol
But again, depends on the theme
 Wokarol#0940: > I don't need to worry about building my game
Theory: *Not worrying about building*
Practice: *Fixing issues with build pipeline*
 BadPiggy#5202: But I wouldn't do Zelda style blocking.
 BadPiggy#5202: Depends on the theme and if I even do an action game tbh
 edison_tang#9524: I think block is easier imo, though they both require maybe some timing
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: dodge-you turn off your collision box while a character is in a state and turn it back on when it is. from there world's your oyster
 BadPiggy#5202: 2.5D
Technically 2D lol
 Lawn#1538: But also 2D or 3D?
 Pokon#5248: Is the block just like Zelda blocking with a shield, or like fighting game blocking where you need to choose high/low?
 gotimo#3069: like dead cells for example
has parries/blocks with shields but also just a dodge
 Pokon#5248: It's gotta depend on how it's implemented
 Lawn#1538: Dodge.
 gotimo#3069: i'm a sucker for both being options
 BadPiggy#5202: Yo peeps btw
Just a question wrt combat design
Which do you think is easier to teach a player in an action game in a game jam
-> Block based mechanics
-> Dodge based mechanics
 edison_tang#9524: high asf jamm
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: guess people will have to confine their spam to that channel instead
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: what a mystery
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: oh wowiee who left this signpost pointing to a designated hype channel here? 
 wiz#4227: jammin levels have reached unprecedented highs
 Scolon#4218: I'm currently looking into continuous deployment so I don't need to worry about building my game
Hopefully it isn't too hard to fix
 Wokarol#0940: Yeah, asking for people that are free during this weekend on a discord server full of people jamming this weekend might not be the best idea
 BadPiggy#5202: JAMMIN
YEET
 NoiZ#0207: jamn
 edison_tang#9524: jammin
 gotimo#3069: we jammin?
 GodOfPro#7302: Everybody is jamming
 Michel#2879: oh ok thank you
 Wokarol#0940: I would generally be okay with that but I doubt I will be able to respond as I will jam
 Phallo#3476: 100% agree! at least take a quick look at most of the things you think you will need to know before the jam
 unityAccount#7810: You can always ask in 
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: What tools to use for the jam also depends what you are trying to get out of it. Plenty of people use game jams as a time to try out new tools because it's a set about of time they have for a focused session, but that's usually people who already have a skillset they are trying to expand
 Michel#2879: But I think If someone would be free to dm him if I am having struggle with Unity would be nice
 edison_tang#9524: yea keep going, even if the game is kinda wack at the end lol
 BadPiggy#5202: Aye don't worry. You know very well what you can do. Just keep practicing and keep yourself and your expectations in check
 wiz#4227: if nobody got me i know brackeys and unity forums got me
 Wokarol#0940: How much time you have before the jam?
 BadPiggy#5202: Don't leave learning for the jam
 Michel#2879: yeah I tried some basic 2d stuff. Sprites, colliders, rigidbodies, moving player. Still a little unused to them so may feel a little dispresed. but nvm
 BadPiggy#5202: You have like 3 days left, can always learn some basic unity kek
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: ok fair I missed the "or everything" I think we're agreeing with each other in a very confused way lol
 Phallo#3476: haha i was thinking the same thing
 Wokarol#0940: Great minds think alike
 edison_tang#9524: nice suggestion!
 unityAccount#7810: You won't lose much if you don't win the jam, so I'd say try to learn Unity and have fun
 Wokarol#0940: And as I said
> So, depending on where the square stops being square, square rotated 90 degrees changes nothing or everything
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I think Unity and Godot are solid choices for a 2 day jam depending on if you are going 2D or 3D
 Phallo#3476: i would suggest taking a look at unity before the jam to get a quick feel for it and then use if you like it use it during the jam... also c# is very similar to java and should feel mostly at home
 Wokarol#0940: Well, I would suggest you trying Unity now, before the jam and seeing how it works. Java is pretty close to C#. If you don't vibe with it, go with Java but double check how to properly turn jar into exe
 Fraserfatt#1021: learning your way around is not too bad. You’ll find that unity c# syntax is very similar to Java for scripting
 edison_tang#9524: game jam is a pretty tight schedule, it can take a long time to learn things while on the fly making games, it's great to ask for help while you go through that route though
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Yeah but that's what I said... I said "in fairness just because a square is a square doesn't mean it has an even pattern on it"
 edison_tang#9524: i think you can stick to what you are comfortable with atm, If you end up joining a group with other ppl who know unity, they can teach you
 Michel#2879: I don't have a problem using Unity. but I mean I am still on a learner level
 theChief#0001: You can definitely get enough players without a web version ☺️ if you want to get better with unity though, a jam is a great place to do that!
 Wokarol#0940: It's a square **image**, not just a square
 unityAccount#7810: I'd say it's a nice chance for you to better learn Unity
 birdstone#3073: ~~make your own game engine~~
 Michel#2879: what do you guys think
 Michel#2879: I am trying to pick a tool/language for the jam.
I feel more comfortable with Java since I code in it a lot, but it takes time and is hard to distubite jar files.
Unity gives time advantage and is easier to get players.. 
still I am like  very basic level in Unity
 Wokarol#0940: Oh, never had that. Some Irish tradition I assume
 birdstone#3073: hooh
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: No a square means the outer shape has 4 even sides, the pattern on it can be anything
 loogi#4810: Yeah, instead of pipe bombs they send you swarms of little gnomes that burn your crops and eat your children
 edison_tang#9524: hows things? excited for jam?
 edison_tang#9524: whaddup boi
 Michel#2879: whatsupp beautiful people
 Wokarol#0940: Pipe bombing your teammate's house is a standard practice to strengthen the bonds and test the ingenuity and quick thinking of the members of the team. Don't worry about it
**
 Viola_Buddy#6763: If you're in 3D that's a meaningful sentence still if you rotate around one of the other axes
 Wokarol#0940: Food poisoning from a pipe bomb.... Yeah, I can see that it's your first jam
 loogi#4810: Pipe bombs look more like actual food and are easier to make
 Jeker#3389: I dont think anyone is that toxic~~, probably only a normal bomb will be sent to your house~~
 birdstone#3073: i don't think it'll make that much of a difference but up to you
 loogi#4810: Should you include that it's your first jam in the post
Or is it a horrible idea that will lead to a pipe bomb getting sent to your home and you dying because of food poisoning
 Wokarol#0940: So, depending on where the square stops being square, square rotated 90 degrees changes nothing or everything
 Wokarol#0940: Unless it's a square with a pattern or modified square. But those ain't squares
 Wokarol#0940: I mean... it kinda does
 Jeker#3389: like, the defenition of a blank square
 birdstone#3073: true you have a point lol
 Jeker#3389: it was a blank square
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: in fairness just because a square is a square doesn't mean it has an even pattern on it
 Jeker#3389: thank god no
 birdstone#3073: is your arts teacher also a math teacher
 Jeker#3389: My arts teacher once said: "Ok, now we need to rotate the **square** ***90*** degrees"
 BadPiggy#5202: Lol
In my case during one of our online exams, some people were listening to Spotify
 Wokarol#0940: We had an exam in Uni where we used phones/laptops to solve the exam.
Funny thing was that we solved it way quicker than the time limit. So you could see everyone playing some mobile games and stuff and then you look at the professor on his phone scrolling and not paying attention
 Capybara#8868: ah
 birdstone#3073: lmao i know nothing about valorant
 Capybara#8868: Did he top frag
 Wokarol#0940: When you are playing cs go during classes and get matched with your professor
 BadPiggy#5202: Oof
 birdstone#3073: someone started streaming valorant to the class when we had online classes
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: lol oh dear
 Wokarol#0940: "Does someone know the answer to that question"
"Pushing A, pushing A, quick!!!"
"No need for that excitement but yes, A is the correct answer"
 BadPiggy#5202: Damn. Sorry to hear this
 Wokarol#0940: I'm not saying I am a great student who pays attention in classes tho, but during online that was even worse
 BadPiggy#5202: I remember once, one of my friends was gaming online and he started speaking in the in-game voice chat
Unfortunately for him, his mic for the online class was also turned on XD
 Fraserfatt#1021: my last two years of college were mostly a blur
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: I didn't have a chance to meet any classmates to make friends with or get to know the profs personally to maybe ask for help
 Wokarol#0940: Same, I don't have adhd..  I think, but damn, I can never focus on online classes
 Fraserfatt#1021: lectures at home ugh, they were the worst for me paying attention
 BadPiggy#5202: I always played during my online classes lol
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i had trouble just in general because I had no structure and having undiagnosed adhd sucked for following lectures at home. I legit had times where I was playing minecraft with the lecture playing in the back
 BadPiggy#5202: I feel you man. In my 7th semester, we had all of our exams for the entire semester clumped together for 3 weeks straight
I think I got 4 hours of sleep in total in those 3 weeks lol
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I was one of those people who was pretty good at written exams so I was lucky. I know they really mess people up
 Fraserfatt#1021: that's too many exams!
 BadPiggy#5202: No lol. Just comp sci in general
 Capybara#8868: skipping igcse chem was a mistake
 Fraserfatt#1021: good lord
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: 14 exams in one exam session. Final exam was maths core 4 back to back with further pure 2
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: im sure my experience is like. not examplary. I started right when covid hit so attendance kind of was not the best when you just start out
 Penguin#7600: did you take compsci or something in the gamedev field
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: Reminds me of a-levels where I tanked everything first year and had to resit all first year exams while studying for second year exams
 BadPiggy#5202: I just finished uni actually lol
 Capybara#8868: uni sounds real scary
 Capybara#8868: im already struggling with as cambridge
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: I'm behind a semester and had to do six exams just this semester to even try to catch up
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: you want that to be the first thing you say when you come back? You don't want to just move on
 Fraserfatt#1021: post-secondary hurts
 Capybara#8868: yikes
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: WATCH OUT. IT'S TWO GORILLA'S, SEPARATE FROM EACHOTHER
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: night sleep well
 RedTeapot#1960: Alright, it's 1 AM, gotta go to sleep
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: ~John Wilkes Booth
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: its literally as you said. "When all you have is a hammer everything looks like a nail"
 RedTeapot#1960: That timing kek
 Wokarol#0940: It's exactly that in english
 RedTeapot#1960: I wonder what the proper English phrasing is then
 BadPiggy#5202: First time that I've heard that saying actually lol
But yeah, I see what you mean
 RedTeapot#1960: Oh cool
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: that's very much a thing in English yeah
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: downright miserable, thanks for asking !
 Hobusu#5033: *"Dark Souls* is the Dark Souls of puzzle games"
Yeah, that checks out
 Capybara#8868: damn hows uni
 RedTeapot#1960: Reminds me of a saying that goes like "When you're holding a hammer, everything looks like a nail". Might not be a thing in English though
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: to myself? yes
 Wokarol#0940: It's that a personal attack or something?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: 🤯
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: diaries of a wimpy 21 year old with way too many interests one of which is game dev
 BadPiggy#5202: All games are puzzle games
 RedTeapot#1960: What if the game we make turns out to be not a puzzle?
 BadPiggy#5202: But in your case,
How about the puzzleteers
 BadPiggy#5202: Noice
 RedTeapot#1960: Google seems to show some results though, which I don't like
 birdstone#3073: sounds about right
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: nice
 Capybara#8868: What
 RedTeapot#1960: Well, we don't have a decided name (yet?) but I randomly thought of Pixel Pilots
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: 3
 Capybara#8868: so does that make a team of 2 or 4
 birdstone#3073: Fifteen Separate Gorillas
 BadPiggy#5202: What was your team name ?
 RedTeapot#1960: I kinda thought about one but it was somewhat taken. Not of much purpose anyways but just a cool little thing
 Wolisunde#0144: Bogenheim
 Two Separate Gorillas#0001: Four Separate Gorillas
 BadPiggy#5202: Same Braincell
 Fraserfatt#1021: yeah I didn't think about this tbh 😂
 Fraserfatt#1021: my team name is fra-
 birdstone#3073: daniel
 wren#0640: same joke
 wren#0640: my team name is wren
 BadPiggy#5202: BadPiggy
 RedTeapot#1960: So, are any of you giving your team a name?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: you can chill for 10 mins with your pet elsewhere
 BadPiggy#5202: (oinks in cringe)
 birdstone#3073: uhh
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Move on
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: also phrasing
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Your pet has a different relationship with you than a random person online
 birdstone#3073: see you
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Welp gtg
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: don't be creepy
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I think most people would probably say they were excited and nervous. Game jams are fun but hard work
 Fraserfatt#1021: 🤨
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: No thanks.
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I'm both super excited and anxious at the same time for the jam. Which is like... I'm just play testing I don't need to be anxious.
 BadPiggy#5202: F
 birdstone#3073: you did nothing wrong dw
 birdstone#3073: don't do what i do and panic and forget basic human functions lol
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: there's some resources in the pinned comments that can help you get an idea of timescale and there's a bunch of resources there as well you might find helpful
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Gl to you as well!
 wiz#4227: i've helped with a couple of small games before but time limits are gonna be interesting to work with, gl everyone 👌
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: always worth checking
 birdstone#3073: it's not a bot lol
 birdstone#3073: i have some captchas we can use
 Jeker#3389: give it a paradox
 BadPiggy#5202: It'll be a trial by fire, but you'll love it none the less
 Teslobo#8274: Have fun; don't hurt yourself
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: hey you a bot
 Astral#7476: Oh, uhhhh I am kind off dumb then
 birdstone#3073: goodluck to you, it'll be very fun and a good experience
 wiz#4227: this is gonna be a first for me ngl, never done a gamejam before lmao
 BadPiggy#5202: Pretty sure it's a bot
 Astral#7476: I am doing good as well, thank you for asking! 🙂
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Heyo you wonderful people. I hope you're having a nice evening/morning/whatever timezone you're in.
 birdstone#3073: it's called "fortnite"
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: no one has games to send yet
 Astral#7476: Hello! How are you?
 birdstone#3073: i love blues scales more than i like people
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: I love modes more than I like people
 BadPiggy#5202: Just rip-off your favourite riffs and add your own spin to it
 Jeker#3389: off topic but, for me, the best and worst part of game jams, is coming up with ideas lol
 birdstone#3073: *cough* "won't bite you for trying to make it" *cough* music theory
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I didnt think it was going to bite me
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I want to do a kind of old-world, folk, funk thing and it's just going to be a whole situation
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: yeah, just trying to remove the fear itself - music won't bite you for trying to make it! it's really fun
 birdstone#3073: o shit
 Jeker#3389: damn, now thats passion
 Phallo#3476: my guy is 21 and has been making music most of his life/completed a college degree in music
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I'm not talking about the game jam, just games in general
 Astral#7476: Hi! 🙂
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: thats not helpful advice. Someone because scared about something doesn't mean they aren't going to do it
 Redline#7370: Luckily I'm doing everything solo and I make bangers sometimes 😎
 birdstone#3073: i personally consider mine also to be god tier but we're also still kids so for his age he's god tier
 wiz#4227: hello 👋
 Phallo#3476: luckily i have a god tier musician on my team or the sounds would have just been beeps and boops
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: no use in being scared, download lmms and just start
 birdstone#3073: LOL yeah i have a friend who's super skilled at composing so we typically work together
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I think making music for games is the thing that scares me the most lol
 birdstone#3073: i'm gonna try to keep playing it for as long as i can
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: one of my cousins played violin actually, but they stopped recently, dunno why tho
 birdstone#3073: i have some ideas on how i might incorporate that into a game
 birdstone#3073: lmao yup, i'm more of a violin player than a bassist though since i've played it for much longer
 Phallo#3476: in the spectrum of string instruments those really are at opposite ends 😛 but i know a few people as well that play similar instruments to you
 birdstone#3073: ~~metal~~ jazz
 birdstone#3073: *gonna pull a cuphead and get a full jazz band for my jam game*
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: guess what genre i wanna learn
 birdstone#3073: ooo two jazz rhythm instruments
 Roiboi#2055: also the old code from our first game jam is horrendous
we have
```C
if 
```
and adding together vectors without normalizing them 
as well as a long `if` `else` chain that could be replaced with a single line of code
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: awesome! i'm trying to learn guitar and keyboard
 birdstone#3073: see you ali
 yugioh#7402: Oops my battery gonna die
Bye everyone
 birdstone#3073: i do bass guitar and violin (don't question this combination)
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i think i might be at my parents when i get to work on the jam so that means i *could* hypothetically record something on my guitar for it
 birdstone#3073: oh you reminded me i think i might try incorporating real recorded music into a game
 yugioh#7402: Oh gotcha
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: nah, because then it becomes an exercise in music theory rather than just hearing something and going "well, that sounds good". you're forced to do stuff based on the theory therefore practicing your music theory muscles
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I'm gonna review all of our old jam entries with the team so we can talk about what did/didn't work for us in the past and how we can all improve for this next project.
 birdstone#3073: have fun, tell me if that plane engine's any good for making games
 yugioh#7402: Bye slam
 Lyfe#8258: Anyway takeoff now goodbye
 Roiboi#2055: Thus far I've realized that making a cool looking menu is actually lower on the priorities list than fixing a critical bug. Whoops.
 yugioh#7402: Isn't that called the infinite monkey equation
 birdstone#3073: that's a good plan
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: that's kind of like those challenge things musicians do where they make a track without hearing it
 Roiboi#2055: I'm revisiting our old game jam entries and making improvements to practice
 birdstone#3073: use the plane's built in engine
 Lyfe#8258: /making it tomorrow
 Lyfe#8258: I suppose i could try designing a game on this plane without actually making it
 yugioh#7402: Offff that's sucks
Good luck
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: You got this, lyfe!
 Lyfe#8258: Damn im gonna get back home like midnight so I'll only have like 2 days to practice my work flow
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i'm alright, i have a starfinder session in around a hour and a half
 yugioh#7402: I'm doing great thx for asking wbu
 birdstone#3073: not bad, how about you
 Capybara#8868: nz honestly has decently nice weather
 birdstone#3073: lmao yeah, right around when summers starting
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: yeah i'd take winter over summer too honestly
 cathy#3897: i think late may is the last time it snowed
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: damn i didn't know that
 yugioh#7402: We don't have spring and fall here in iraq so my fav season is summer because cold sucks
 birdstone#3073: same honestly
 birdstone#3073: there's a 80% chance it'll snow in both spring and fall and spring is when the snow melts so roads are muddy and there's rabbit crap everywhere
 cathy#3897: i prefer this over any other climate
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: yeah no i know of the truth and know that the best seasons are spring and fall
 yugioh#7402: Thx
 birdstone#3073: ohhh god that happens too lmao
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Yeah, sure! I won't be able to read it until I get home, tho!
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Awesome! May you have many fun game moments
 RedTeapot#1960: And when it was the mask time I had ice forming on my eyelashes lol
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Shadow btw. I finished the not that great murder mystery. Can I dm it to you?
 RocketCow#5210: as god intended
 yugioh#7402: I'm great I'm still happy since a week because of my new gaming laptop
 birdstone#3073: you can feel ice forming in your nostrils when you breathe in
 birdstone#3073: living in -40C weather? because you really don't want to lol
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I'm good, wbu?
 yugioh#7402: Hi hi hru
 birdstone#3073: last year was hell
 yugioh#7402: I instantly remembered the emprors new groove
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Hello everyone.
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Don't joke about people telling you to stop squabbling, just do it. It's really not the time for humor, yea?
 RocketCow#5210: the dream
 cathy#3897: about 10 degrees is quite perfect weather for me unfortunately it's teaching the 30s this week
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Save the drama for a llama.
 cathy#3897: yeah
 birdstone#3073: anything above 10 degrees is hot for me because i'm so used to living in -40C weather
 yugioh#7402: I tried telling them
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Ya'll just stop squabbling
 Dagi#2077: I am the ghost of christmas eve oooo
 Jeker#3389: dude my project looks so sick with animations
 yugioh#7402: Please dagi shadow no drama please
 Capybara#8868: should I be concerned that I don’t remember a hot day in a while
 Dagi#2077: Check your walls :}
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: That's how you waste electricity.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: ice cream sandies have been my saviour as of late honestly
 yugioh#7402: That's a mood right here
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: lol
 birdstone#3073: you guys ever just open your freezer and look in it during a hot day
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: *Finally!*
 L3mmy♡#2307: Just be careful with soy sauce- and sushi is probably fine- said eyes sticked to a screen, not hands-
 yugioh#7402: Bye bye
 yugioh#7402: I never had that problem because i made sure my hands are clean even when i was a kid
 Dagi#2077: Oh btw my mobile is 1% ik youll all terribly miss me😚😚✌️
 birdstone#3073: please dont handle food with your hands when you're also touching a keyboard
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: first day takoyaki/sushi, next day chicken nuggets and fries could be a good 2-day solution here
 Dagi#2077: NOOO THE XBOX CHEETO FINGER FLASHBACKS
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: not quite fast food though i guess, and could get on the expensive side depending where you get it.
 birdstone#3073: i was gonna say you can use your hands but realized you're touching a keyboard
 yugioh#7402: Or takoyaki is also a good option
 L3mmy♡#2307: grab it one by one with your hands
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: 'have' is a strong word there
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: hmm... you do have to eat it with chopsticks
 birdstone#3073: sushi's probably a good option
 L3mmy♡#2307: Sushi would be a good option maybe ?
I love myself some sushi
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I can teach you, but I ||get paid by the hour. So, it'll probably be best to keep it brief. ||
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: yeah, i can't think of anything else fast food related that would be more perfect than chicken nuggets eaten with utensils
 DrNukeLear#2414: Hi Dave
 Dagi#2077: 🥰
 yugioh#7402: And damn right it's better than hers
 Capybara#8868: what experience had lead you to eat popcorn with chopsticks
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: Downside of soup is I need to look down in order not to spill; something like chicken skewers requires minimal eye work
 birdstone#3073: ~~or do what i do and forget to eat~~
jk don't do that absolutely don't do that
 Dagi#2077: Matt stonie ur foods
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: soup is too much of a hazard next to a computer imo
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I'm not allowed to have milkshakes anymore. Not since all the boys came to my yard, that last time.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: that's fair and I'm sorry for you loss. You could go with our convention of avoiding crunch and use your eating time as a short break away from staring at a screen
 Dagi#2077: Imo just eat as fast as humanly possible
 L3mmy♡#2307: I'd say soup is your best bet- just need a bowl and a spoon
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: Eating random food with chopsticks is a great way to practice - if you've never eaten popcorn with chopsticks, I highly recommend
 Orange Dave#7083: Hello chat.
 L3mmy♡#2307: smooth soup, not the one with bits of veggies in it, might clog it up
Might be possible to make a non-dairy one at home, but that does defeat the purpose of a takeaway somewhat
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: pizza is too cheese and can easily make a mess, so are burgers, chicken nuggets are good becuase you can take one (maybe with chopsticks, if you wanna be advanced?) and pop one in your mouth and type while chewing
 Dagi#2077: Yeah so soup it up
 yugioh#7402: Yeah tho i haven't seen one irl
 L3mmy♡#2307: x333
 Dagi#2077: Ever heard of drinking helmets?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: just like mash your face in a bowl of soup right next to your computer's ventholes. it'll be fine. i swear
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: A sub is actually a good choice
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: real answer is milkshake because now hands required, but anything you need your hands for is less efficiant lol You don't want too greasy
 birdstone#3073: is it eat soup or drink soup?
 yugioh#7402: Hi shadow
 birdstone#3073: eat soup with a fork
 Dagi#2077: Everything thats like not too meaty is very easy to blend, especially with fluids
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: Oooh, strong option
 snuffysam#2767: "easiest fast food to eat" is probably a sub of some kind
idk if i'd want that for dinner though
 L3mmy♡#2307: Get a soup with a straw- x3
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: What blends the best? My instinct is noodles, which zero reason why
 yugioh#7402: Ohhhh gotcha
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: chicken nuggets are less of a mess than anything i can think of, + a healthy portion of fries
 Dagi#2077: Oh one of the asdf movies (12 i think) had an anime opening so its a colored version (that my friend colored) of the i like trains kid
 birdstone#3073: gonna have a jam in the bathroom then
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: Risk of toppings dropping off is non-zero tho
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: but then there's the added difficulty of getting pizza grease all over your stuff
 yugioh#7402: Taco bell maybe
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: phrased like that, the answer is clearly pizza
 Dagi#2077: Put in blender
Consume at once
 yugioh#7402:  i like your pfp where is it from if i may ask
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: Important jam question: I'm treating myself to a takeaway on Saturday night. What's the easiest fast food to eat while glued to a screen?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: cool ok i'll carry on not caring i'm continuing my quest to solve export problems and learned that i have to include *.json to the exported resources in my game export thing. still not sure what the problem is with textures though
 Dagi#2077: Best buds :)
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: When things happen and are rectified it's not a smart move to keep discussing them. It's been fixed, move on
 SlamBamActionman#7160: I think we can move on from this now yeah 👍 All is good
 Dagi#2077: I had a bio that COULD BE INTERPRETED as offensive
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: don't worry about it we are moving on
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: wha happen?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Depends on if you behave
 Dagi#2077: Awww im lovely? :)
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Yeah for every 9 people doing an ironic edgy joke there's one actual nut in here who's just going to make trouble, best not to accidently encourage them
 SlamBamActionman#7160: More like 0.01% yikes. But it's not 0! So we have to keep an eye out
 SlamBamActionman#7160: 99% lovely people, 1% yikes
 Dagi#2077: O btw love ur videos :))😇😇
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: jokes about being "ironic" based on stuff that a LOT of people actually believe don't translate well in written format
 DrNukeLear#2414: Another server I frequent would have banned first and ask questions later.
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: You'd be surprised the types we get in here
 Dagi#2077: No sane human would put it in their status unironically just saying
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Yeah it's just a matter of the 'joke' potentially not being clear to people
 Dagi#2077: Better call saul :)
 DrNukeLear#2414: Likewise
 Dagi#2077: Ohh
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: it hadn't before
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Ok its just updated for me
 Dagi#2077: Wdym look at my bio
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Ok yeah... change it
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Yeah going to need you to change that I think
 Dagi#2077: THATS WHERE I STARTED USING IT HAHA
 birdstone#3073: whenever i see someone use the word "perchance" all i can think about is mario the idea vs mario the man
 Dagi#2077: New bio haha ha hhaa   Ha
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I would very much suggest an edit
 Dagi#2077: Thank you saul
 RedTeapot#1960: I think you'll find out soon
 DrNukeLear#2414: Might I suggest an edit.
 Jeker#3389: I think sarcasm/irony is the cheapest type of humour, but anyways
 Dagi#2077: And thats how i roll shitty jokes all dayyy😎😎
 DrNukeLear#2414: I couldn’t possibly comment.
 wren#0640: its a bit of a shit joke to make "ironically"
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I'm still deciding
 birdstone#3073: *perchance*
 Dagi#2077: Is this a stricter server, perchance?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: > It may be, but it’s sufficient to get you banned from some stricter servers.
^
 Dagi#2077: Am i tho🤔🤔🤔
 L3mmy♡#2307: You forgot straight as hell- /j
 DrNukeLear#2414: It may be, but it’s sufficient to get you banned from some stricter servers.
 Scolon#4218: canceled!!!
 Dagi#2077: Am i being cancelled?😰😰😰
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: hu huh
 RedTeapot#1960: Huh
 Dagi#2077: ITS IRONIC NOOO
 wren#0640: dagi
 L3mmy♡#2307: Who ? Me ?
 wren#0640: interesting bio there
 L3mmy♡#2307: Welcome back!
 Scolon#4218: Back
 Dagi#2077: The menace is BACK
 L3mmy♡#2307: What tells you a quick lil' nap at work- what ? Aren't codes made to be broken ?
 Astral#7476: Oh thats cool! The only thing i've ever done was a flappy bird clone in Game Maker
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: although knowing that your game doesn't run on some people's computers is useful feedback
 L3mmy♡#2307: Just use a semi-transparent tilted cylinder, save of resources
 unityAccount#7810: So?
 DrNukeLear#2414: Do it the Quake 3 way.
 L3mmy♡#2307: Some would completely destroy your rating for an unplayable game on their end-
 L3mmy♡#2307: I'm on a laptop- Lucky I don't rate games I struggle to run-
 Fraserfatt#1021: damn, my raytracing plans are ruined /j
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: also mark's windows machine iirc is like a 6600k + 1070? even if you successfully put together a ue5 showcase game i don't think it would run well
 L3mmy♡#2307: *Go sleep then*
 Fraserfatt#1021: I mean I’m gonna use unity, but I’ve been noodling with ue5 just for training
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Go and try it, seriously. You do not want to be learning how to build and export a game in the middle of a game jam
 theChief#0001: I don't mean to rag on the engine, it definitely has a lot of uses and there will be some _incredible_ games built with UE5 - but it's not an indie-friendly engine 😂 it excels at big projects - action adventure games, big open world RPGs, etc
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: *I'm sleepy.*
 L3mmy♡#2307: Try before the game jam so you don't have any surprises
 Fraserfatt#1021: I run unreal smoothly but I haven’t tried building it. Now I’m terrified lmao
 slightlybonkers#4912: alrighty, I'll stick to UE4 then, thank you so much
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: it's ue4 with some extra features that both aren't ready yet and which you absolutely will not be able to use in a game jam
 DrNukeLear#2414: There’s a learning opportunity here.
 slightlybonkers#4912: yeah I don't want that to happen
 unityAccount#7810: Lol, didn't think of the negative meaning when I wrote that😅
 slightlybonkers#4912: yeah my PC dies when I try to run it
 L3mmy♡#2307: I mean- what could go wrong ? Okay, you might have to give up on sleep, but you can do it /j
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Open all the tools you want to use for the jam, make sure everything is updated or is at the version your team has agreed to use.
Make a project with a moving square, export it to your chosen platforms
Upload it to itch.io and test that it works.
Doing this should tell you if you have everything you need and should alert you to quirks of your chosen game engine  having something moving on screen makes it easy to see if it works or not and should only take a few minutes
 theChief#0001: I'm torn between enjoying this joke SO MUCH and wanting to mute you for it 😉
 L3mmy♡#2307: Naaaah, you'll be fine- make your dream MMORPG with a complex tech tree game for a short, fast paced 3 day long jam, you'll be fineeee /j
 unityAccount#7810: Indies should just stick to real engines
 DrNukeLear#2414: Yeah new Unreal Engine versions always seem too demanding for the hardware available at time of release.
 theChief#0001: in fact, I'd say indies shouldn't care about the new features at all, because they're only relevant for games that are way too big for small teams to handle
 theChief#0001: also, the new features actually make performance a _lot_ worse for everything other than a few very specific use cases - like large open world games, which an indie should absolutely not be attempting 😂
 DrNukeLear#2414: Also when it comes to review time you don’t want it crashing on the end users machine.
 theChief#0001: everyone I've met that has used it dropped it after a few weeks
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: huh... it works now but there's some problems with the actual resources, like the tileset didn't load
 Fraserfatt#1021: I’d use UE5 if I was a touch more familiar. But I’m also solo so.  I also wouldn’t recommend trying to force yourself to learn it in  a few days.
Don’t burn yourselves out! You gotta have *some* fun!
 L3mmy♡#2307: 3 screens was apparently too much...
 slightlybonkers#4912: really? damn
 L3mmy♡#2307: Game was too much for my bad wifi to put on once Itch.io but it worked
 Avelore | Bloomzeye (They/Them)#3394: Oh hey! I use GDev also. I’ve been really liking the engine so far. I made my last game in it.
 slightlybonkers#4912: right yeah I can use that, thank you
 L3mmy♡#2307: It- worked well enough in my case
 slightlybonkers#4912: yeah I'm aware, unfortunately
 wren#0640: oh shit i just realised i dont have the export templates downloaded for 3.4.4 because of this thank you that couldve been horrible
 L3mmy♡#2307: I used GDevelop to make 2 games all by myself
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: "visual coding" is still coding and is still not easy to learn in a few days. You are still learning the logic of code and how it goes together you;re just not learning the writing format for it at the same time.
That said not being able to code doesn't mean you wouldn't be able to get something on the screen especially if you are someone with the free time to practice in the next few days It could be an interesting challenge,
that said again 3 days is definitely enough time to find a new team and the  room will open a day before the jam if you get really stuck
 DrNukeLear#2414: Your chance of finding a team wanting to use UE5 is slim.
 RedTeapot#1960: I mentioned CORS above, it indeed prevents loading resources when opening index.html locally. Still works when using a proper server (Itch for example).
I might be wrong again though kek
 theChief#0001: might be best to stick with 4 for the jam
 theChief#0001: oof, I've heard UE5 has a bunch of stability issues
 slightlybonkers#4912: I wanna try out UE5 for this jam
 slightlybonkers#4912: game and level design
 theChief#0001: do you need html5 export?
 Fraserfatt#1021: I like connecting the lil noodle lines now 😂
 L3mmy♡#2307: If you have the logic for programming but you don't understand languages well enough, visual scripting is really nice
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: turns out the problem isn't solved yet. looking into exporting html5 better cause i tried without any tutorial or something and it gives me an error about resource fetching
 Fraserfatt#1021: after doing straight code for years, I’ve only recently started doing visual scripting via unreal blueprints. It’s nice but still a challenge since the logic still gotta be tight
 L3mmy♡#2307: I can't code in regular coding languages but I can manage with visual scripting
 RedTeapot#1960: How old that version was? Isn't it like the CORS whatever?
 Fraserfatt#1021: It’s still something you gotta *learn* though. It won’t be *no* work 😂
 Fraserfatt#1021: Coding in text can be daunting and syntax can be a pain to learn. Visual scripting helps ease that problem, imo
 theChief#0001: and Unity 😂
but yes, visual programming _is_ programming, it's the same skill just presented differently!
 Clive Dev#0446: visual scripting still requires a programmer mind set
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: that's not helpful. that _is_ programming
 1DEDARY#1307: Yeah
 L3mmy♡#2307: So does Unreal Engine
 1DEDARY#1307: If you don't know how to code, gamemaker studio has nice blueprint system
 L3mmy♡#2307: I can't code either- yet I made 2 games by myself, doesn't have to be C++ or anything, something like Construct 3 could work well too
 DrNukeLear#2414: Ok, solo may not be the best option. What’s your skill set?
 slightlybonkers#4912: 1) right, my bad, but just trying to be honest
2) yes I did
3) I can't code 😭
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: thank god i did testing for html5 exports - apparently the old version of godot i was using had problem with fetching resources. downloading a new version to test it out there. remember to test your intended exporting solution before the jam!!
 DrNukeLear#2414: Couldn’t resist
 DrNukeLear#2414: PLATFORMS!
 theChief#0001: hollow knight is more similar to castlevania/bloodstained games I guess
 theChief#0001: and that's what I personally look for in a platformer
 theChief#0001: I prefer the new ori, it's just a delight to move around
 DrNukeLear#2414: 1) Not the best thing to say when looking for a new team
2) Did you apologise?
3) Solo is an option.
 Wokarol#0940: Never played it, the closes I've played is the new Ori
 slightlybonkers#4912: I got kicked out of a team for doing something stupid
 slightlybonkers#4912: I have a post already
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Oh btw - I've started the drone game 🙂 - its just making the area for the drone to fly around that I'm struggling with
 JuliusCube#8501: movement-wise it is a little annoying i agree. metroidvania wise its great
 BadPiggy#5202: Yes
 EpicRaisin#1626: so im my own artist, programmer, sound designer, composer, community manager, and demotivator?
 theChief#0001:  will help there 🙂
 samcox08#6606: I feel like there's a lot of heft to moving the character in Hollow Knight.
 BadPiggy#5202: ***No you don't***
***Because you are a team all in one***
 slightlybonkers#4912: I need a team 🥲
 theChief#0001: yep, it's a great metroidvania - really well deserving of all the hype and praise it gets 😁
 DrNukeLear#2414: I actually agree with this view, but the game is still good despite the controls
 EpicRaisin#1626: will you snail movement tho
 theChief#0001: hollow knight, for example, feels a little crappy to control IMO. Controversial opinion but it is _not_ a good platformer 😉 not for movement, at least, when you compare it to things like ori, celeste and meat boy. Those are all a joy to move around in, and HK just isn't (in my opinion).
 theChief#0001: yeah it could - or something like castlevania
 Wokarol#0940: Because in them, the platforming might not feel the greatest but it's not the main thing
 Wokarol#0940: I could argue that a platformer game where platforming is not the focus. Like platformer puzzle games. Those could slightly avoid this issue. 
 Wokarol#0940: No, that's fine. I have experience with helping people in Brackeys but not as much experience with first games of people.
So I am fine with believing that your stats are more appropriate
 birdstone#3073: lmfao i am aware
 BadPiggy#5202: I meant I'ma go play something lol
 birdstone#3073: badpiggy's a game??
oh right, bad piggies
 BadPiggy#5202: Aight.
I'ma game then
 theChief#0001: didn't mean to essentially pull rank, sorry 😂 I love this stuff, I've really enjoyed refining the art of the "first game"
 birdstone#3073: **ruuuubies**
 EpicRaisin#1626: song failed, get em next time
 birdstone#3073: hello a𝓿𝓸𝓬𝓪𝓭𝓸𝓹𝓮𝓮𝓵
 BurnV06#5857: It’s yours, my friend, as long as you have enough rubies.
 a𝓿𝓸𝓬𝓪𝓭𝓸 𝓹𝓮𝓮𝓵#4117: hi daniel
 Wokarol#0940: Fair, you have more experience in that area than I do then
 birdstone#3073: i am daniel
 EpicRaisin#1626: morshu, you wanna tell me what this is all about?
 BadPiggy#5202: No offense but ....
Why do people not try to hold to shoot lol.
This happened the last time I made a top down shooter as well
 birdstone#3073: you want it
 EpicRaisin#1626: lamp oil, ropes, bombs
 theChief#0001: OH
yeah
wow, I can't imagine trying to play with tap fire - 22 seconds is pretty damn impressive for that
 theChief#0001: I'm just going on experience - I've been helping people start game dev for about 4 years now, seen and helped literally hundreds of people make their first game 😅 from my experience, very few people who start with a platformer go on to share them. Could be a limitation of my sample size and my area, but I'd be willing to put money on it being causation not correlation 😂
 birdstone#3073: ~~ive played the zelda cdi which wasnt even made by nintendo~~
 EpicRaisin#1626: CodyCantEatThis would like to file a complaint
 Lawn#1538: The tides have turned, I've discovered hold L mouse button.
 BadPiggy#5202: Semantics kek
JK
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: nintendo games are like refiend to almost perfection in a way that most indie games cannot afford to be. an indie dev could've not had made mario odyssey or metroid dread, for example
 BadPiggy#5202: Also I can't really comment on Nintendo. I've only played a few gameboy games lol
 EpicRaisin#1626: no, those same grads were hired by Valve to make portal
 BadPiggy#5202: More specifically, the original concept of the first game was made by college grads
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: nintendo games don't feel like indie games at all
 BurnV06#5857: See also: most Nintendo games
 EpicRaisin#1626: well the first one was made by a bunch of college graduates
 BadPiggy#5202: Actually, now that I think about it
The portal series feels like the most Indie AAA games ever
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: you can play portal 1 in the time it takes to watch a short movie and the fact it's like that makes the game work so well
 BadPiggy#5202: Lol. Yup. Did not expect that
 theChief#0001: I was actually going to make it harder, so the ring contracts over time - but I didn't have enough time for that  and for the extra two little polish passes I did for it I focused on game feel rather than difficulty 😂 I'd be willing to bet there's a hard cap on score, they spawn faster and faster
 BadPiggy#5202: Portal 1 felt like a game jam game to me tbh lol
Another reason why I loved it
 EpicRaisin#1626: they kinda have to, ||since they completely changed the end of ep 2||
 Wokarol#0940: Playing some crappy platformers in my life, I don't think you need much to feel proud of
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: the reasons why 1 is so good is becuase it's the perfect example of a perfectly self-contained game
 birdstone#3073: WOOOOOOO
 BadPiggy#5202: || Though looking at the ending of Alyx, we will be getting another half game ||
 birdstone#3073: gabe newell in elementary learning how to count
 EpicRaisin#1626: imagine having 5 games and still leaving you on a cliffhanger, couldnt be portal
 wren#0640: i dont really agree with that? portal 2 is genuinely one of the best games ever made but 1 is kinda mediocre imo
 Phallo#3476: there was a thing years ago where you could create a website and it would be added to a raspberry pi server and shot into space... i made website of the space scene from portal so our little buddy could finally go where he always wanted to be 🙂
 BurnV06#5857: 1, 2, Alyx
 BadPiggy#5202: ( sad pig noises )
 birdstone#3073: count to 3
 EpicRaisin#1626: facts tho
half life is good but gosh dang portal is good
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: tepid take imo
 BurnV06#5857: I’m stuck on the level where you get the ability to place orange portals
 BadPiggy#5202: Hot take :
The Portal series is better than the half life series
 EpicRaisin#1626: space core is the best core because space is  y e s
 Jeker#3389: that and portal 1 were the only puzzle games i actually sat down to complete
 Lawn#1538: There's no mercy in this game.
 Space Nerd#6264: I like space
 BadPiggy#5202: Space space must go to outer space
 Jeker#3389: man portal 2 was such a good game
 EpicRaisin#1626: hi, im the fact core, i tell you useless facts to distract you from wanting more video sequels
 Jeker#3389: Ah yes :))
 BadPiggy#5202: SSSSPPPPPPAAAACCCCEEEEEE
 EpicRaisin#1626: hahahahha
wheatley crab
 BadPiggy#5202: I miss Wheatley :(
 DrNukeLear#2414: Chell shoots shells at suspicious shapes seething silently
 Jeker#3389: but, its a siderscroller, and less focused on meele, and completly focused on guns and speed, for example, the main character has a dash, which he can use to dodge bullets
 EpicRaisin#1626: screw it, desert eagle
 birdstone#3073: she sells sea shells on the sea shore
 Jeker#3389: well, for like, an actual game i want to eventually sell, I am making a hotline miami style thing
 EpicRaisin#1626: chells shells sell sea shells to seal the seas shells seething somewhere she shall search
 Jeker#3389: nice
 redka#6365: not for the jam, as practice
 BurnV06#5857: Chell sells sea shells by the sea shore
 redka#6365: we're making a game where the protagonist has a photon cannon that can shoot out light particles
 EpicRaisin#1626: portal 3: chell has shells
shotgun shells
 redka#6365: you would not believe why
 BurnV06#5857: Reminds me of portal
 wren#0640: i like the music
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: awesome
 Scolon#4218: nice
 wren#0640: a *lot* of indie puzzle games are based on its basic formula
 wren#0640: sokoban is a puzzle game where you have to move crates into specific spots on a grid
 wren#0640: the feeling of making a really good gotcha in a puzzle>>>
 birdstone#3073: please enlighten me on what sokoban means lol
 wren#0640: i really wanna do a sokoban-y game for this jam because i wouldnt *quite* say puzzle design is my strong suite but its definitely one of the things i most enjoy in gamedev
 theChief#0001: DM is alright yeah 🙂
 birdstone#3073: woo, should i dm it or is it fine if i put it here?
 theChief#0001: happy to, yeah!
 Lawn#1538: Noice.
 birdstone#3073: actually  if you're really familiar with top down shooters i'd love to get some feedback
 birdstone#3073: my previous two gmtk jams were both top down shooters lol, i'm pretty proud of the 2021 one
 EpicRaisin#1626: clbuttic companies
 BurnV06#5857: Money
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Um, that was your whole story? :/ Nothing more?
 BurnV06#5857: Yeah because for example I won’t have access to my windows desktop until a week after the 48 hours ends
 EpicRaisin#1626: why doesnt the free version let you make EXEs tho, thats such a basic thing for game creation
 birdstone#3073: i remember when i tried uploading to web in the 2020 jam all it exported was a blank screen and i never knew what was causing that
 Lawn#1538: I’ve had a few friends and my partner say “is that it?“ so many times after my platformers attempts.
 Scolon#4218: web games are the most accessible game you can upload to itch.io, so try to do that for the jam
 fkfka#2863: Thats very cool! Thanks!
 theChief#0001: I might do - but if I do, I'm using Corgi Engine again so I don't have to bother with the character controller 😂
 EpicRaisin#1626: web games are supported on itch.io, and even recommended because more people will play it if its a web game
 theChief#0001: getting to the "fun" is VERY important for people learning game dev. You want something you can show off to your friends and family! I guarantee that never happens to new devs who make a platformer first 😂
 fkfka#2863: I mean, free gms doesnt provide you the way to make .exe file, only web thing
 ADEEL#5105: How about u make platformer this time
 EpicRaisin#1626: no, you can use any engine you want, if thats what you mean
 BadPiggy#5202: All of my games so far have been beat-em-ups lol
 birdstone#3073: woooo speedrun
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: yeesh my last character controller script for a platformer was 360 lines of code, and i thought it was getting way too big to actually be reasonable
 Wokarol#0940: I disagree. Platformers are good starting games.
Good platformers aren't
 BurnV06#5857: Reminds me of how every game I’ve managed to finish so far has been a top down shoot em up
Edit: actually except my first game which didn’t have shooting
 theChief#0001: I did this for my first two ludum dares 😂 in the second one, my level was eventually beaten in 11s
 BadPiggy#5202: All of my games have been on a single plane for the last 3 years. Not too much verticality
 fkfka#2863: Hello! I want to use GMS 2 for this gamejam, but I have trouble paying for creator version.
According to previous year experiences, will it be required to be graded in the gamejam?
 DrNukeLear#2414: Afternoon
 birdstone#3073: i try to avoid platformers in jam games since i don't want to spend a day and a half making good controls and then having like 4 hours to finish the rest of the game lol
 ADEEL#5105: What were you making then
 BadPiggy#5202: I just realised, I haven't made a platformer in 3 years lol
 theChief#0001: they're a good solution that do a lot of legwork for very little effort!
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i've seen people use this solution but it always seemed just a bit of bandaid solution. but eh honestly rounded collision shapes are looking more and more good to me
 Lawn#1538: I know that they ported a lot of the Celeste sound assets from Pico-8, the FMOD project they open sourced has some funny notes.
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Heyo
 theChief#0001: you can also use a rounded rectangle, a circle, or a capsule for the representation of the player
 BadPiggy#5202: Aye, use circle collider and set friction to 0
 birdstone#3073: i always used physics materials and that solves it pretty well, maybe not the best solution tho lol
 theChief#0001: they strongly coupled the movement code to all of the animation, art assets, even things like badeline is all in that one script
 ADEEL#5105: You mean character stuck on coreners
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: yeah
 birdstone#3073: you mean like preventing the character from latching onto a corner when trying to jump over a wall or something?
 BadPiggy#5202: My pig brain can't see it XD
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i've gotten better at doing platformers but i still have absolutely no idea how to do corner correction stuff lmao
 Lawn#1538: That seems like too many, but I know nothing.
 birdstone#3073: it's a similar story to the controls of mario 64 where they spent a lot of time just making the character fun to control
 DrNukeLear#2414: I’m new here, but I see a pattern emerging.
 theChief#0001: and correction for things like dashing into corners or halfway through platforms (if you've got a dash)
it's very difficult to list all of the things you have to do to make a platformer feel good, because it's usually pretty unique to the mechanics you've got
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: you might be able to keep collision detection but i'm not even sure about that
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: maddy thorston probably spent months finetuning the controller to perfection
 EpicRaisin#1626: reminds me of how in my first platformers, i didnt use physics materials, so you could jump up and move into a wall to either float there or go down slowly, because of friction
in a 3D game i even decided to keep it as scuffed wall running until i added an actual wall jump
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: for celeste i think you would have to
 BadPiggy#5202: Beat-em-up over platformer
 birdstone#3073: celeste has REALLY good controls though
 DrNukeLear#2414: I would rather build an RTS than a platformer.
 BadPiggy#5202: They used Monogame so yeah
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: grace periods, input buffers, and coyote time - the trinity of making a good feeling platformer controller
 birdstone#3073: if i remember correctly they had to code their own physics for celeste
 ADEEL#5105: Min was also on game maker
 theChief#0001: celeste's character controller is over 5,000 lines of code - and it's all absolutely needed
 birdstone#3073: LOL
 BadPiggy#5202: ( recommends talk given by Dev of dead cells )
 SlamBamActionman#7160: My first game was a platformer that used a sprite-based collision box in Game Maker.
It had the excellent mechanic that you could grab on to ledges with your nose because it stuck out like 2 pixels further than the rest of your body.
 BurnV06#5857: I’ve honestly been tempted to make a virus that just rickrolls people and nothing else
 EpicRaisin#1626: technically true, since you can just make a .bat file with the command `rm / -rf`
 birdstone#3073: make it the player's fault and not the game's fault
 Redline#7370: don't give ideas to *them*
 theChief#0001: making a fun platformer is about reading the player's intention, not the raw input
 birdstone#3073: oh i accidentally made a fork bomb on my old laptop which isn't a virus but it was something
 DrNukeLear#2414: This is an understatement.
 Tapu#9161: ~~making a virus is probably easier than making a platformer~~
 EpicRaisin#1626: imagine using libraries for canvas in JS, i just use built in functions
 theChief#0001: the issue with platformers is that if you want it to be fun, the character controller is _incredibly_ complicated
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: but the idea still stands. 3 simple ideas to realize a game that's realistically something you could make in a week or two, maybe even less
 birdstone#3073: 13 year old me was hired to tutor a kid how to code in python and he immediately jumped to wanting to make a platformer with pygame
 Tapu#9161: A text editor, a browser and Coding Train is all you need to use p5js
 theChief#0001: you can get a platformer up and running very quickly, but it will feel like ass to play
 Redline#7370: My first project was a racing game
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: ehhh yeah remembering from my first few attempts at platformers that's true
 EpicRaisin#1626: mm true
i have a love/hate relationship with scratch
 Lawn#1538: I think my first project was "roll a ball".
 theChief#0001: platformers are _not_ simple, at all
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: the point is that the games are simple but that you give them the opportunity to choose what they'd rather do. giving them autonomy is going to be key to keep them interested
 Tapu#9161: I think you can export scratch games as html build
 theChief#0001: they really aren't 😂
 not without text#5469: embed scratch or if turbowarp has somehting
 theChief#0001: but
 theChief#0001: sorry
 theChief#0001: NO PLATFORMERS ARE NOT A GOOD FIRST PROJECT
 yumaikas#3530: Unless you want to lean into making Scratch games. Granted, I don't know Scratch very well, heh.
 Wokarol#0940: Yes, the 1st step will teach them how it all merges and creates something. 2nd one teaches them programming in an environment they know, 3rd ties it all together**
 theChief#0001: mine was actually a pokemon rom hack 😂 the first one I did any programming for was a stupid 3-year long macromedia flash 8 platformer that never got finished. **Don't make your dream game for your first game, folks** 😂
 EpicRaisin#1626: im not sure how one would share a scratch game, but my answer is vanilla JS with HTML canvas
 birdstone#3073: this is pretty good too
 Tapu#9161: I like p5js
 yumaikas#3530: p5.js, easy
 Lawn#1538: > *people*
Good to know I'm not alone.
 not without text#5469: which is better for a game jam: p5.js or scratch
 birdstone#3073: that's actually a pretty good idea, i can prepare a bunch of stuff and people can put things toether
 birdstone#3073: i tried using scratch when i had an interest in making games but i hated it so much
then i tried gdevelop because i wanted to not code
then i got familiar with unity
 BadPiggy#5202: Actually wait, now that I think about it, my first game was a turn based space invaders in the console back when I was in high school lol
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: what about this: you make a few different ideas for games that would be good to teach to newcomers, like 2 simple 2d games, one a platformer, the other a simple shmup, and a 3d game, like roll-a-ball or something. then you give them input on what they want to work on by making them vote on what game they want to try making first, or even allowing them to choose between these 3 projects on their own
 Wokarol#0940: Now that I think about it more...
**1. Start with no code, just putting together components then
2. Premade, almost finished games they have to write some piece for to teach them programming in small doses then
3. Making full, simple games**
And as a step 1.5 you can show them something like 7 Billion Humans
 BurnV06#5857: Mine was made in Scratch and also sucked
 EpicRaisin#1626: it sucked
 EpicRaisin#1626: since yall are talking about first games, mine was made in Python
 birdstone#3073: ofc, i'll definitely do so
 BurnV06#5857: Actually make that 2 planck times
 cosmicfox#9193: My first game was using Twine technically 😂
 DrNukeLear#2414: Feel free to come back and ask again or DM
 birdstone#3073: ty for all the help
 BurnV06#5857: 2 milliseconds for me
 EpicRaisin#1626: my attention span is only 1.04 milliseconds
 yumaikas#3530: My first "game" was in QBasic, my first visual "game" was in Envelop Basic, and was based on what I'd seen in WarioWare DIY, lol
 BadPiggy#5202: Good thing I'm a pig
 birdstone#3073: LOL fair
 Scolon#4218: Sorry guys my attention span is only 2 seconds!
 theChief#0001: I'd extend that to _people_ are dumb
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: my first game was the roll-a-ball unity tutorials back from... unity 4, i think?
 birdstone#3073: kids are dumb and need something fun to grab their attention for 2 minutes
 BadPiggy#5202: I learnt this through jams lol
 Scolon#4218: My first games were in scratch many many years ago
 birdstone#3073: LOL i tried making a kind of recreation of doom which i was proud of but never chose to finish
 DrNukeLear#2414: My first “game” was in Visual Basic 6. Keyboard controls moved a disabled button around the screen, when it was in the correct place it became interactable and you clicked it to win.
 birdstone#3073: ohhh boy
 BadPiggy#5202: Make the next DOOM
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: with programming you want to teach people by making them do something concrete. you can't just make people learn by making them do Accounting Simulator #3030432345. i had to make so many of those in highschool and it was the worst
 birdstone#3073: **nah i'm gonna start with an fps**
but yeah flappy bird and the leaderboard thing are good ideas
 theChief#0001: (it's a very easy way to teach a couple of programming fundamentals)
 theChief#0001: (and you can still do the leaderboard first)
 theChief#0001: definitely a _quicker_ intro to game dev
 birdstone#3073: yeah that's true, unfortunately i can't necessarily place "prerequisites" in a club lol
 theChief#0001: though actually yeah what piggy and fox said (we're a veritable farmyard in here now) maybe flappy bird is a better way to go than a top down shooter!
 BadPiggy#5202: In truth, it's probably better that they left, anyone who stayed behind atleast knows what they're in for lol
 birdstone#3073: i'll note this down too
 yumaikas#3530: If I was going to start, I'd start with a very minimal "move a thing around using the keyboard"
Something you can do in 10 lines or code of less in almost any engine
 Wokarol#0940: For example, have them program something like a spinning wheel which select some option. It's not a game but it's simple and interactive
 cosmicfox#9193: I second this. Flappy Bird has pretty much all of the basic concepts of a game and lets you build the logic nice and easily. I see it as the hello world of games
 theChief#0001: from that command line leaderborad, you can then move on to some of the game dev bits - like moving one of their sprites across the screen.
Then go to making that sprite point at the mouse 
from there, creating a new object and moving it in a direction 
then creating enemies, then attaching score to those enemies, then using that original leaderboard and populate it with the scores!
 birdstone#3073: i'm most likely going to try visual scripting
 RedTeapot#1960: Then some people leaving might be an unavoidable part of it. Not everyone understands the hard truth about gamedev taking actual time and effort
 birdstone#3073: we'd have very few members lol
 DrNukeLear#2414: Also take some time to look at and evaluate Unity’s Visual Scripting system. It might be useful as a teaching tool.
 Wokarol#0940: I would teach them basics of programming through isolated simple examples that are not games but scratch the "moving fun thingy" itch
 BadPiggy#5202: Maybe say that basic programming knowledge should be a prerequisite then ?
 birdstone#3073: yes and gta v
 Wokarol#0940: Nah, it's not a good idea.
Imagine you have people wanting to make games and see stuff moving and you start with "okay, but first let's make some text console programs"
 Scolon#4218: Let me guess they thought they were going to make the next minecraft?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: game maker then, it's very powerful and still uses visual languages (they changed the name from drag and drop)
 ADEEL#5105: bruh if you want to learn something start simple
 Squishy Turtle#3988: 6
 birdstone#3073: i'll note that down, tysm
 BadPiggy#5202: Let me guess, they wanted to make GTA V ?
 theChief#0001: what I do when I'm teaching people is starting with a local leaderboard - take a name, input a score, save that score. Then load it again when the program first runs
 RedTeapot#1960: Maybe some visual scripting puzzles to explain basic concepts but still have something moving on the screen
 birdstone#3073: it seemed this year people assumed the game dev club made "real" games so when we tried doing stuff with scratch to demonstrate some concepts a lot of people left
 DrNukeLear#2414: 1) Start with them making sounds and sprites.
2) Add those sprites and sounds into a very basic game.
3) Give them five minutes to look at their stuff in the game
4) Break into the code and show them the code that ran the game.
5) Get them to build the code from scratch putting snippets together.
 BadPiggy#5202: It's still necessary though
 RedTeapot#1960: They might need some sort of a hook though, bombarding people with OOP and stuff right from the start might be discouraging
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: the written down aspect is very intimidating for a lot of people, so learning in a less confusing environment like visual coding - that doesn't require perfect syntax or knowledge of exact keywords - is a good place to start to get you used to the paradigms before you learn about syntax
 birdstone#3073: yeah i was thinking that, maybe just starting with learning how to code
 Wokarol#0940: And that might sound dumb but:
**Assure them that no matter what, you can rever the changes they made so they don't have to worry abd should experiment and make mistakes**
 BadPiggy#5202: If they haven't programmed at all, then starting with basic gamedev is a bad idea
 Triggered#6897: Might as well just use scratch then?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: or game maker since it has visual language stuff too and the free trial recently went infinite
 Squishy Turtle#3988: maybe I'm crazy but programming isn't hard in and of itself. The hard part is all the vocabulary that bombards you when you try to start
 Wokarol#0940: Also, you can provide them with plenty of well made components that are clean and read like english almost so they feel comfortable messing with it
 ADEEL#5105: start with hellow world😆
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: yeah, visual scripting is actually great honestly. if they seem very unexperienced stuff like scratch could be good
 birdstone#3073: visual scripting to start is a good idea
 Scolon#4218: What's up jammers
 Triggered#6897: Give them pre made shaders to play with, tell them to change shader para. And they will be willing to learn more
Try to use a shader that easy to explain
 RedTeapot#1960: Maybe make teams? And/or some graphical languages like GDevelop
 BadPiggy#5202: Teach them how to make flappy bird
 ADEEL#5105: totally agree follow tutorials to a point when you get comfortable then start practicing
 birdstone#3073: lmfao that's a great idea
 theChief#0001: don't talk about the coding! Just say "we're making games!" and surprise them with it xD
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: start with slow and easy short projects
 Wokarol#0940: Oh no
 BurnV06#5857: I don’t use tutorials either because ADHD
 birdstone#3073: oh that reminds me
i'm leading the game dev club at my school, any tips/advice on how to not scare away potential members from the coding part? because it seems there's a lot of people interested in starting but are too spooked by the coding bit
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: next year i'll have to actually take a course in game design for my CS degree that's going to use unity
 theChief#0001: ah damn it I misread xD
 Squishy Turtle#3988: haha sorry. I'm not working *at* Unity, just a job that uses it
 birdstone#3073: i should be doing that
 BadPiggy#5202: Back in my day, I had to focus all my time on school welp
 birdstone#3073: no lol i'm still in high school
i think last year's results probably motivated me to the point where i'll be continuing game dev for a while
 BurnV06#5857: I started at 11
 ADEEL#5105: nyc
 theChief#0001: _back in my day_
I had to learn macromedia flash without youtube or any sort of tutorial like that 
 Squishy Turtle#3988: I got a job working with Unity recently so my unity skills have increased a lot since then
 birdstone#3073: oh hey i also started at 13
 ADEEL#5105: are u in gamedev now or some other stuff
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: memories of learning how to first use unity with the roll-a-ball tutorials... those were the days
 birdstone#3073: LOL i sort of neglected school a bit because of gamedev but it wasn't too bad and i'm focusing more
 ADEEL#5105: bcz after all that learning my brain burnt up now its time to put those learning to use
 theChief#0001: I totalled my hours and it's approaching 25,000 hours of Unity dev
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i've been doing game dev with various different engines since i was 13, so i've been doing game dev for like... 8 years. which is crazy to think about
 RedTeapot#1960: I'm an adult and I have less gamedev time than before lol
 ADEEL#5105: and came to jam to practice my skills
 birdstone#3073: hey that's pretty good
 BadPiggy#5202: I think it's been 3 years since I first started using Unity
 ADEEL#5105: seriously i have used unity for 4 months now
 birdstone#3073: unfortunately i am not an adult and don't have this full time experience
 birdstone#3073: damn i've only used it for 3-4 years lol
 BadPiggy#5202: I couldn't get Monogame working lol
 ADEEL#5105: yeah only get comfortable with it
 theChief#0001: I've used unity full time for 7-8 years, I think I'll be using that lol
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: one day i wanna try out development with stuff like monogame or love2d
 ADEEL#5105: no you said wrong its notepad
 birdstone#3073: **notepad++**
 RedTeapot#1960: Whatever engine you use is cool
~~If it's Godot~~
 ADEEL#5105: yeah once you get used to it very good
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: gotta have my disclaimers before any incidents like yesterday happen where i said i didn't remember a thing from unity and i got told "stop saying that unity is bad"
 BadPiggy#5202: Same
 ADEEL#5105: good luck with that
 birdstone#3073: i'm using unity i'm way too comfortable with it
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: * subjective opinion
 birdstone#3073: nah this is the engine jam we're making game engines in 48 hours
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: godot, da best in town
 RedTeapot#1960: Godot of course
 ADEEL#5105: So all are gonna use unity or any other engine
 RedTeapot#1960: And most importantly, super easy
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: not time consuming at all
 ADEEL#5105: very sensible
 birdstone#3073: solution: make your own engine the day before the jam
 MolassesLover#4128: I feel this
 MolassesLover#4128: Just tell Unity to be simpler
 birdstone#3073: i have been so burned out for the past month or so i haven't done anything lmao i'm gonna die during the jam
 ADEEL#5105: Dont worry i know that feeling
 dejaboox#1899: I JUST GOT UNITY FOR THE FIRST TIME, THIS IS SO DAUNTING
 MolassesLover#4128: I've been doing so much development in preparation for this year's jam
 Redline#7370: yes shadergraph epic
 ADEEL#5105: I am also learning about shader graph
 dejaboox#1899: GUYS
 theChief#0001: shadergraph is a godsend, yeah 😂
 birdstone#3073: please don't remind me of when i tried to write shaders before i learned about shader graph
 theChief#0001: you could - you can also multiply things by 1 or 0, that tends to be how things work in shaders!
 DomG#9983: 400$ from newgrounds bug bounty
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: if the condition never happens, you skip the code, if it does happen, at the end of the loop there's always a break to stop the cycling
 birdstone#3073: coming right up
 ADEEL#5105: give me one plate
 birdstone#3073: so i have to make a spaghetti cooking simulator?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i think you could substitute if statements with while by doing something like
```
while{
//stuff
break;
}
```
 birdstone#3073: very sensible
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: The code for your game must visually look like the game you're making.
 ADEEL#5105: Its all about enjoying
 Cameron#7818: Shoot is Move?
 BadPiggy#5202: ***No***
 Lawn#1538: Do you want to win or not?
 ADEEL#5105: i mean not here
 birdstone#3073: i tried that on my old laptop and almost killed it
 Lawn#1538: Then you're the winner so far.
 Redline#7370: no it's gonna have an "is" in the theme
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: ok, gonna use while statements instead
 ADEEL#5105: I didnt write any code
 Lawn#1538: ~~It's  'no if statements in your code'~~ No one knows except Mark.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: impossible game jam for godot devs
 BadPiggy#5202: Move to shoot
 birdstone#3073: yeah none of them are restricting to a specific genre and they allow for a lot of creativity
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: horizontal jam
 ADEEL#5105: any idea what is the theme gonna be
 BadPiggy#5202: Get's disqualified cus he submitted the game a few mins after the jam started
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: :why_dissolve:
 Lawn#1538: Codes the entire game before the jam starts.. wait..
 wren#0640: the gmtk themes so far have been pretty good about applying to virtually any genre i think
 BadPiggy#5202: I hate themes that lead to genre locks
 theChief#0001: and yes I ran "bullet hell jam" 😉 but that wasn't about bullet hell the genre, it was about cramming as many bullets into your game as possible lol
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: Before or after it's minified? 👀
 birdstone#3073: write the thing in 1 line
 theChief#0001: I hate genre locks
 BadPiggy#5202: I mean yeah, those are limitations as well. Not only genre locks lol
 ADEEL#5105: Good Luck 🙂
 Lawn#1538: GBA theme, roguelite theme.
 theChief#0001: you can't replace theme with a genre specification xD
 theChief#0001: what? No this is bad, I don't like this 😂
limitations IMO would be "use a restricted palette", "use only this asset", "don't use a single `if` statement in your code"
 Redline#7370: yes of course
 BadPiggy#5202: In hiatus. Doing his own thing
 Lawn#1538: Is he *brackeying* back into the scene again?
 ADEEL#5105: He left the channel but jams are still going
 Redline#7370: I don't know but maybe you could ask him
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: while themes highlight the design process and the process of coming up with a fun idea, asset limitations usually highlight the actual production process and stimulate you creatively for what to do with a given material
 ADEEL#5105: u'll join it?
 BadPiggy#5202: A limitation is more like " your game must be a rogue-lite " or " your game has to look like a GBA game "
 Mark Brown#6982: what happened to Brackeys? What's he up to now?
 Redline#7370: yes next one is at august 21st I think
 theChief#0001: hmm, actually this is a pretty good point - maybe one of the jams I run next is based around this 🤔
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i think both themes and asset limitations are interesting for different reasons
 ADEEL#5105: are brackeys jams still going
 Lawn#1538: Themes basically are limitations?
 Hobusu#5033: ~~this year's theme will be limitations~~ (this is not the actual theme)
 【Ｐｏｇｇｙ　Ｆｉｓｈ】#2026: facts
 Squishy Turtle#3988: pretty sure most people would agree with that
 Redline#7370: brackeys jam is a week long, so a week?
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: that’s interesting, i wonder what a jam based on limitations would look like
 ADEEL#5105: how long it took to complete
 BadPiggy#5202: Hot take :
Limitations are better than themes
 Redline#7370: no it's a bossrush game
 Lawn#1538: You might see an influx of new jammers looking for memebers closer to the jam day, so don't fret too much.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: yeah, i got mainly inspired by the 5 dev challenge videos by miziziziz, they usually limit themselves by assets and not theme
 ADEEL#5105: sandbox type like minecraft visuals are pretty good
 Squishy Turtle#3988: well now that he's here
 theChief#0001: all of my self imposed ones are 30 minute jams 😂
 theChief#0001: I like it a lot
 theChief#0001: oh that's a neat idea
 BadPiggy#5202: I'm a piglet in comparison
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: then this is my third jam! my first jam was a self-imposed jam where i made a game using only the space invaders spritesheet
 theChief#0001: if I didn't count self-imposed ones, my number would be closer to 70-80ish
 BadPiggy#5202: You're forgetting the chief lol
 RedTeapot#1960: What about theChief?
 theChief#0001: absolutely, yeah!
 ADEEL#5105: what was the theme
 Squishy Turtle#3988: piggy is the senior here
 ADEEL#5105: 14 amazing
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: do self imposed jams count?
 Triggered#6897: I meant I have but yeah its pretty close 2 jams , 3 including this one( I took part in others but either could not even start or could not complete the game in time)
 ADEEL#5105: You mean one
 【Ｐｏｇｇｙ　Ｆｉｓｈ】#2026: Is there any team that wants two people one that codess and can draw because im tired of looking in the list it gets me nowhere.
 Redline#7370: first one had the best results (insert kekw)
 BadPiggy#5202: My 20th something jam
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: My 6th jam. GMTK 2020 was my first
 ADEEL#5105: cool how it went
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: this is my second jam, first 2 day jam
 SquidGeneral10#4090: this is my seventh, or so. 2021's GMTK was my first.
 Triggered#6897: ☝️ 
 Redline#7370: 4 I think
 RedTeapot#1960: Yep
 ADEEL#5105: Hi fellas have any of you participated in game jams before ?
 BadPiggy#5202: The pig blows everyone else up and leaves
The end
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i mean, most animals usually dont wear pants
 RedTeapot#1960: Presumably all without pants because these are for losers
 Triggered#6897: Starts a spark
 BadPiggy#5202: And a Mark
 Squishy Turtle#3988: walk into a bar
 Redline#7370: hmm yes line
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: so a sheep, a pig, a squid, a turtle, and an hedgehog?
 Squishy Turtle#3988: so a hedghog then?
 Triggered#6897: Where's mowgly though
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I'm Shadow. Hi.
 BadPiggy#5202: Oink
 Lawn#1538: and ~~ewe~~
 RedTeapot#1960: A teapot
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: so a squid, a pig, a sheep, a turtle, a ~~penguin~~
 Merus#7019: I go by Merus
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: well, for 50 minutes - an hour
 Triggered#6897: after reading everything, I am **Triggered**
 BadPiggy#5202: *had a penguin
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: cheap
 birdstone#3073: what happened lol
 Lawn#1538: ewe
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: so we have a turtle, a pig, a sheep, a penguin - who else
 SquidGeneral10#4090: Lol
 RedTeapot#1960: Crunchy Penguin for some variety
 Squishy Turtle#3988: I mean Penguin is a pretty boring name, how about Squishy Penguin
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: taking no names. damn
 Mark Brown#6982: There we go. All good
 Mark Brown#6982: Whoops, I only gave you a ten minute time-out  - was supposed to be an hour like your friend!
 MetalGearSamus#0001: I mean, you could argue that putting more into a game allows the companies to extract more value from their workers by making them put even more time into a product while underpaying/crunching them, etc.
 Phallo#3476: ive seen it first hand when working for large companies and it is disgusting
 theChief#0001: yeah this is exactly it 😂
 theChief#0001: if the people who spend the money had to do everything one handed, you can be pretty sure they'd make it more of a priority 😂
 Phallo#3476: sadly large companies usually dont actually care about their customers... it is all about min maxing the amount of money they make
 cactusking789#2185: we're a team of 3 , looking for voting?
 SquidGeneral10#4090: Sony's first party studios are setting by example, and they're industry leaders, so I think the future is lookin' good for accessibility
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: yeah, my point exactly. we need, as consumers, to make it their problem that the games the industry produces aren't accessible enough, championing good accessibility whenever it's in games
 theChief#0001: both of which are an issue because the people who control the budget don't think it is worth the money, because they haven't had to experience playing a game that isn't built for accessibility from the perspective of someone who that would benefit 😅
 DrNukeLear#2414: This
 SquidGeneral10#4090: & while menus are something I'm dabbling in more, I don't think many gamejam games can provide more than simple audio / sensitivity options
 theChief#0001: not necessarily - you have a global "game speed" float and you multiply every "time" value by it 😛
 Phallo#3476: not fully true... it is a lot of the time pushed to the side because "that costs money" and "most people can already interact with it"
 ADEEL#5105: Thanks
 BadPiggy#5202: True. Would definitely need a LOT of tweaking is all lol
 lemmtopia#4415: Good luck!
 theChief#0001: it's SO useful to people that have slower reaction speeds, though. It won't ever lead to lag, and you can fix timings by taking the game speed into account
 BadPiggy#5202: I'm pretty sure bandai namco technically took most of the money lol
 ADEEL#5105: this is my first game jam hope to make good games
 SquidGeneral10#4090: I don't know if this is all in a gamejam context, but time is a big factor in my design decisions
 RedTeapot#1960: I think they still compare costs vs profit
 ADEEL#5105: HI
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: fromsoft? having money problems?
 RedTeapot#1960: Money perhaps?
 theChief#0001: psst - it's because the people who control development are all rich white men who have never had to face anything that even remotely resembles a challenge
 BadPiggy#5202: This seems like it would make the problem worse and maybe lead to lag depending on certain timings
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: why isn't it a priority though?
 DrNukeLear#2414: It is a bandaid solution, but when you take a finished product you’re down to bandaids. I’m all for accessibility from the ground up.
 MetalGearSamus#0001: I know people modded this in on Sekiro, which I think is great. That game is so good but all I hear about it is how much people struggled to get very far.
 BadPiggy#5202: Even more stuff to test and fix later on then.
In other words, not a priority in the beginning
 theChief#0001: in Unity - the Time.timeScale setting 😛
 DrNukeLear#2414: Constant bullet time, but scaling.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: see but that's the thing - that's a bandaid solution. why not design from the ground up with accessibility in mind?
 BadPiggy#5202: When we say game speed, are we talking frame rate ?
 DrNukeLear#2414: Because the difficulty compounds the accessibility issues.
Making it easier is not necessarily a fix, but a game speed slider would make it easier for someone who has fine motor skill issues.
 BadPiggy#5202: I'm fine with the Devs keeping their vision and having no difficulty modes.
But people really do need to learn the difference between accessibility and approachability lol
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: this could easily get fixed by allowing button remapping
 theChief#0001: it's quite an easy one to describe the differences between approachability and accessibility I guess - pretty easy to say "you don't need to make dark souls easier, you need to sort out button remapping"
 Phallo#3476: sometimes it is just the simple things that make all of the difference
vrchat has a new pictionary world that at one point you needed to press both triggers on your controllers to get the keyboard up and make guesses in the game.
my friend couldnt play because he has one broken controller... even though he is fully capable of doing everything else with his one controller... just not answer
 Hobusu#5033: ~~Video game equivalent of Godwin's Law~~
 LethalChicken#3001: 👀
 BadPiggy#5202: Sad
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: because its most prominent quality is difficulty and people look at that first than any other structural problems
 BadPiggy#5202: Question, but why is dark souls the game that always comes up in this discussion ? Lol
I honestly think that's why people associate accessibility with making a game more easier rather than more approachable
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: it's something that comes up a lot in games like dark souls - which absolutely do have problems with accessibility - but the problem isn't in the difficulty itself, it's more in how archaic the button remapping can be and how difficult it can be sometimes to use certain kinds of controllers
 Mark Brown#6982: Please continue your weird bromance in DMs. Have some time out
 BadPiggy#5202: This lol
 Penguin#7600: at least we'll do so while doing what we love (being unfunny)
 Dagi#2077: Disclaimer : haha we are best of friends haha ha ha hahaha ha     Ha    Ha               Ha
 theChief#0001: people often confuse accessibility with approachability 
 Dagi#2077: Were gonna get banned lmao
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: a core concept of the idea of accessibility, as i've said before, is not making the game easier itself, but making the game easier to access itself. stuff like universal controller support, button remapping, designing with color blindness in mind, all are ways to make your game more accessible that don't involve compromising a game's difficulty and still making it very accessible
 BadPiggy#5202: Oh nice
 theChief#0001: yeah - shaky hands 🙂
 Penguin#7600: mod simp
 BadPiggy#5202: Hand tremors ?
 darlingS#1797: Also the fashion world can screw itself because it's BS but the point still stands
 theChief#0001: completely agree, tbh, I'm trying to work out how to do this a little more. First attempt will be to get the press to talk about it when I release my bullet hell that you can play with one hand and with hand tremors. Built it with accessibility at the centre, giving away £1/sale to SpecialEffect and giving away an xbox adaptive controller to someone who needs it - hopefully I can get people talking about it with that? We'll see ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 lilburlap#8480: Whenever I wear a skirt I need to wear it with a hoodie just for the pocket
 darlingS#1797: So many coins lost, so many phones broken and uncomfortably sat on
 BadPiggy#5202: Lol
 Merus#7019: most of the women I know would vehemently disagree with the fashion world on this point
 darlingS#1797: It hurts with no pockets
 darlingS#1797: You say that pants are for pockets, but as a consistent shopper for feminine cut clothing, a lot of people in the fashion world disagree
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: when they put pockets in skirts the era of pants will finally end and the enlightnment we all sought shall be reached
 lemmtopia#4415: I've participated in previous GMTK GameJams, but only made small games or never finished any :(
But now I'm better at finishing things  :)
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: This is because they won't put pockets in skirts. **they need to put pockets in skirts.**
 Dagi#2077: Flawless logic i agree tenfold
 ron0studios#4591: I have finally managed to create the ultimate platforming character for my game through his videos (albeit before he released the platformer toolkit)
 Merus#7019: pants are for pockets, and pockets are for champions
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: pants are for losers
 Penguin#7600: fr he created the next generation of gremlin game developers
 Merus#7019: presumably
 Dagi#2077:  when he brings his own downfall smh
 darlingS#1797: No need. I'm used to talking about it. It's part of who I am and it doesn't hurt to discuss it
 Merus#7019: Mark is just a man. He puts his pants on in the mornings just like the rest of us
 ron0studios#4591: hello!
 lemmtopia#4415: Hey all!!
 BadPiggy#5202: I found about downwell through GMTK and that got me into gamedev lol
 Dagi#2077: Omg “dagi how are you so good at distracting me from work”
 ron0studios#4591: gamedev guru
 DrNukeLear#2414: Can I also (in front of other devs) raise the lack of inclusivity and representation in games when it comes to disabilities.
 Squishy Turtle#3988: yeah actually watching the GMTK jam videos is what inspired me to try out game dev. It showed me making great games isn't exclusive to huge studios
 Penguin#7600: mark brown our lord and saviour
 Mark Brown#6982: 
 BadPiggy#5202: Ouch. I'm sorry
 darlingS#1797: Autism, visual impairments, and motor difficulty
 Dagi#2077: Mark on a serious-er note you inspired me to try out something i dont think i would without you and i love it so thanks big man
 Squishy Turtle#3988: can't wait for friday to come
 BadPiggy#5202: Hey look, it's one of the prev jam winners
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: the aspect of accessibility and designing with disability in mind is something very interesting that should be talked about more than it is currently, honestly
 ron0studios#4591: a decade!!!!
 Penguin#7600: he is a rat
 Mark Brown#6982: I have no idea, actually. Probably a decade
 BadPiggy#5202: Disabled in what way if I may ask though ?
 darlingS#1797: From a perspective of someone who is not a game dev but is still interested and is disabled, the designing for disability was a huge motivator for me to actually learn more about game design
 Triggered#6897: He si horribly cute
 ron0studios#4591: mark how long have you had your profile picture for? I remember asking you the year before last year (or some time around that) where you got it from and you haven't changed it since. (I still applaud your drawing skills though lol)
 BadPiggy#5202: Aye. As long as a good number of people who play my entry think it was fun, that's enough for me lol
 theChief#0001: how do you think I feel, I'm supposed to be working 
 Penguin#7600: unsolicited felipe jumpscare
 Dagi#2077: Yeah yeah we shall abort and not get banned :)
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: as long as you got something from the jam in my eyes it's a jam that went well
 a𝓿𝓸𝓬𝓪𝓭𝓸 𝓹𝓮𝓮𝓵#4117: time to walk away for a minute and come back to 150+ unread messages
 Hobusu#5033: We aren't able to tell what relationship you already have, we just need to keep this a positive environment!
 BadPiggy#5202: ~~or just abandon it and move on to the next jam~~
 Dagi#2077: Good point i gotta show off when we appear in the video and all
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i'd take that as a compliment if i was aiming for good design over playability. if the concept is good, you could take the time to refine it after the jam and make it better
 Penguin#7600: k alon lets not get banned from the ham server
 Dagi#2077: Dont worry hes my best bud🥰🥰
 a𝓿𝓸𝓬𝓪𝓭𝓸 𝓹𝓮𝓮𝓵#4117:  I just wanna say thankyou so much, your game design videos have helped me so much and thankyou so much for hosting these game jams and just being a lovely person in general!
 Hobusu#5033:  and , both of you knock it off
 Penguin#7600: 🤓
 RedTeapot#1960: Maybe it's not that bad my game didn't get into the stream
 Dagi#2077: Ok “AMIR” eli-
 Penguin#7600: alon the mods are angry look what you did
 BadPiggy#5202: Oh god
I still remember one of his comments lol
" This concept is amazing. I'd love to play more but in a better game "
 Dagi#2077: I live in your walls
 Mark Brown#6982: Well this is the first year where I've actually done some game dev and have first-hand experience so I'll probably be a little nicer 😛
 Merus#7019: no sniping at each other thanks
 Penguin#7600: youre adopted.
 Dagi#2077: Mark i just want to say that you really are amazing and also inspired me a lot too even if i have to work with FOOLS like 
 Mark Brown#6982: Yep!
 ron0studios#4591: will you be as harsh as last year? The harshness last year was actually pretty fair
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: honestly i just wanna make a game and get in top 1500. getting top 10% for my second jam ever would be a pretty good result
 BadPiggy#5202: Will you be streaming on YT again ?
 Mark Brown#6982: Glad to hear it!
 Penguin#7600: mark just wanted you to know youre the one that inspired me to start working in gamedev and its amazing that with such a huge community you still take time to interact witn everyone (no matter how dumb they are )
 Mark Brown#6982: I will be streaming during the voting week, so starting Monday July 18th
 Dagi#2077: Well cya on the video then mwahahhahaa
 unityAccount#7810: yeah but there are also streams usually
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i know he showcases the top 10-20 games after each jam is done
 BadPiggy#5202: He streams a few times during voting
 unityAccount#7810: Hey Mark, do you usually stream the jam games on the week after or after the voting is done?
 BadPiggy#5202: The OG untitled game
 BadPiggy#5202: I prefer UGG
 Triggered#6897: Thats a good name UMG
 dardasaba#9759: Alright, thanks! :)
 Mark Brown#6982: Maybe for the next version! I finally added the Linux thingy to Unity for Platformer Toolkit so I can do it now... but will have to wait for a future build of UMG 😉
 Dagi#2077: I didnt ping this timeeee
 Dagi#2077: Btw mark beautiful pfp who drew this masterpiece
 dardasaba#9759: Hey  , sorry for the ping, but I was wondering - is there a chance for a Linux build of Untitled Magnet Game? It looks awesome and I would love to check it out! :)
Sorry again for the ping, hope you don't mind it!
 Dagi#2077: Agreeeeeed
 Mark Brown#6982: The mods rule, couldn't do it without them!
 Penguin#7600: hes not
 poggerat#6311:  r u gonna participate
 DrNukeLear#2414:  - While your here, thanks for putting the Jam on. And I’d like to point out that your mods are pretty awesome. You may know that already, but I realise that it’s a big effort organising something like this.
 BadPiggy#5202: I love gamedev and the communities around it.
Nothing more I can say
 Penguin#7600: i keep seeing you everywhere
 Dagi#2077: OMG THEY UNITE ONCE MORE
 Snakes#8442: 🐅
 BadPiggy#5202: Oh that lol. Thanks
 Penguin#7600: loved your frog jam game
 SquidGeneral10#4090: utterly shameless lmao
 Dagi#2077: True i also hate children
 ron0studios#4591: treading in a minefield i see
 Penguin#7600: yoo bad piggy
 BadPiggy#5202: Kids these days..... Smh
 Dagi#2077: Haha penguin did mark brown not acknowledge you smh
 Penguin#7600: haha dagi did mark brown just call you an annoying gremlin
 Dagi#2077: Uhh friendly fire?
 Merus#7019: man's cruisin' for a mutin' if he's not careful
 SquidGeneral10#4090: Lessgoooo
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Mark is baby, confirmed. 👶
 Dagi#2077: Uhh misclick ?
 Penguin#7600: mans desparate
 ron0studios#4591: could you say whether the first letter of the theme is in the first half of the alphabet or the second half of the alphabet?
 Cameron#7818: video gaem
 Merus#7019: hey, uh, this is starting to get weird
 Redline#7370: yes let's make brackeys happy
 ron0studios#4591: that would probably give it away lol
 theChief#0001: good try, but not happening 😉
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: So true.
 Dagi#2077: Mark brown bear my children
 theChief#0001: they are a lot of fun, highly recommend 🙂
 BadPiggy#5202: What was the inspiration behind this year's theme ?
 dardasaba#9759: That will likely happen, but I don't think it will get high points on creativity... :P
 Mark Brown#6982: I do want to do a game jam one day, but not the GMTK one - maybe Ludum Dare or Brackeys or something
 Mark Brown#6982: Nope, definitely not taking part! For one, I already know the theme! And two - I don't want to take attention away from the community, this event is all about y'all.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: could be interesting to see a game with the same time restrictions and the same theme just to compare it, but actually entering would be... a bit unfair!
 ron0studios#4591: untitled magnet game would destroy the journey and the fun then
 BadPiggy#5202: It'll happen for sure lol
 DrNukeLear#2414: It’s not about the competition, it’s about the journey and the fun.
 SquidGeneral10#4090: I wonder if anyone will recreate it for this jam lol
 ron0studios#4591: it would be unfair, untitled magnet game would destroy the competition
 dardasaba#9759: Amazing price! Limited offer only!
 DrNukeLear#2414: Will you be taking part in the game jam as well?
 Merus#7019: he sounded really different, I don't know what to say
 BadPiggy#5202: Uh oh .....
 Dagi#2077: Uhh  bazinga amiright?😎
 dardasaba#9759: xD
 theChief#0001: the winner gets the unique opportunity to subscribe to the GMTK patreon at 100% of the original price 👍
 Merus#7019: so rarely that last time I got on voice chat with him I didn't actually recognise his voice
 Dagi#2077: Mark i gotta flex i said something dumb to you
 ron0studios#4591: lmao
 Mark Brown#6982: the one and only baby
 Dagi#2077: THE MARK BROWN?
 Mark Brown#6982: Very rarely, at that 😛
 Mark Brown#6982: Appreciate the enthusiasm, but I only do VC with Patrons!
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: if i win, i want to challenge mark in an actual, real fight to become the new mark brown
 BadPiggy#5202: Or how about just Q and A about the design decisions for your jam entry
 Dagi#2077: The real prize is FAMEEEE UNLIMITED BACON NO GAMES
 ron0studios#4591: what about a chat with mark on gamedev?
 BadPiggy#5202: Point lol
 ron0studios#4591: lol
 SquidGeneral10#4090: ... not a bad game idea actually. who wants to main Hideo Kojima?
 Cameron#7818: Isn't that what Quake was invented for?
 theChief#0001: hey here's an idea for a prize - you get a recording of mark speaking the whole script for "planet earth"
there are __definitely zero machine learning-based applications that require that specifically to synthesise a voice near-perfectly__
 SquidGeneral10#4090: you could probably pitch that as the next "YouTuber boxing" thing but with gamedevs
 SquidGeneral10#4090: most teams I know have team members dotted about all over the globe. they'd have to fly together to fight 😆
 BadPiggy#5202: Comic con for gamedevs
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: game jams are just kind of like virtual conventions with an added creative contest at the end, really
 darlingS#1797: "Today's headlines, people across the world are being forced into hospital over a single tshirt"
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i dont get to talk to other devs a lot except during jam times, and it's always interesting to see what people in my same community think about certain things and their approach to different problems
 BadPiggy#5202: Uh oh ....
 ron0studios#4591: ooh what if the winners could go and meet up with mark on VC after the jam is finished?
 Mark Brown#6982: (I don't mind being pinged, it's no big deal - just, like you would with anyone, don't be annoying with it :P)
 BadPiggy#5202: *acquaintances
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: yeah! there's also a community aspect!
 darlingS#1797: I can barely organise mailing something to someone in the same suburb as me. I can't imagine the scale of even just 1 team of people who may be in very different parts of the world
 ron0studios#4591: a battle to the death
 Redline#7370: A team gets a single shirt, they have to fight to decide who gets it at the end
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i consider game jams more like 1) a place to go and exchange ideas given a creative restriction 2) a place to learn under a time restraint certain specific skills
 SquidGeneral10#4090: Dungeon
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: (oh my gosh I forgot to take of ping I think?)
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: yes jam is a challenge not a race
if you put rewards, there will be 2 category:
buggy and crappy games with some gameplay
and awesome stylised ones with a minute gameplay
 BadPiggy#5202: F
 Mark Brown#6982: But with multiple people per team it ended up costing me hundreds of dollars and was a huge pain for, basically, zero gain for GMTK 😛
 ron0studios#4591: could you give the winners NFT t-shirts?
 SquidGeneral10#4090: Crikey, yeah, I can imagine that being a hassle then 😆
 Mark Brown#6982: Everyone in the video, the "top 20"
 darlingS#1797: The prize is a bizarre end sequence that somehow tops the confusion of Neon Genesis Evangelion
 DrNukeLear#2414: Good call
 ron0studios#4591: top 20 (i think?)
 SquidGeneral10#4090: Was that like, the #1 winner or the top 100?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Despite my best attempts to be otherwise
 BadPiggy#5202: F in chat then
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: it's a very interesting subject with a lot of ideas in the discussion currently that aren't being really considered. for example the idea that accessibility = easier game, which i find wrong, accessibility means making the means by which the game is played easier, not the game itself
 Mark Brown#6982: I've spoken to companies in the past about having prizes but ultimately, I feel that too much competition takes away from other, more important, aspects of the jam like finding new collaborators, trying out prototypes, challenging yourself, etc. It also encourages voter fraud and cheating
 DrNukeLear#2414: Lederhosen next time?
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: what if you are a solo developer that isn't using discord?????
 ron0studios#4591: lol
 Merus#7019: Slam is the GMTK mascot
 SlamBamActionman#7160: This is true, this is within my power
 BadPiggy#5202: And all the games we get to play
 Merus#7019: I mean you could always settle game design arguments by calling Mark directly, that'd be a heck of a perk
 Hobusu#5033: ```I helped moderate the GMTK Game Jam chat and I didn't even get a lousy T-shirt.```
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: I thought you mods hide it in your everyday life
 SquidGeneral10#4090: valid
 ron0studios#4591: haha, we need a gmtk mascot
 BadPiggy#5202: Assert dominance and ban someone
Wait.....
 DrNukeLear#2414: Awesome! A very important subject.
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Smh Mark doesn't even send shirts to his staff.
How will anyone know I am a mod if I don't have a shirt??
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: No prizes is a good think for jams
You don't need to spend money for them
:trollface:
 ron0studios#4591: oh i can see how that may be a problem
 Mark Brown#6982: This one's on accessibility!
 DrNukeLear#2414: Unless his fall requires breaking.
 BadPiggy#5202: Legendary types cannot be caught
 Merus#7019: we need him for the weekend
 Mark Brown#6982: One year I did send shirts to all the winners, but it was a logistical nightmare and so not doing that again!
 Merus#7019: please don't catch Mark
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: Guys look!
A Mark
It's free, let's catch it!
*teen titans meme song plays*
 Mark Brown#6982: That's right, there are no prizes in the GMTK Game Jam
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: appearing in a video by someone who discusses interesting game design concepts is an awesome prize in and of itself i think
 DrNukeLear#2414: What’s the subject for the lecture?
 darlingS#1797: It dawns on me how strange it is to talk about the pay of a guy right in front of him and potentially the 1000+ people who pay him
 Hobusu#5033: Hang on, I want to clear this up: as far as I know, there aren't going to be any prizes in this Jam other than the possibility of appearing in a video after the Jam ends; the word "prize" doesn't even appear on the itch.io page for the rules
 RedTeapot#1960: I mean consult
 ron0studios#4591: hello there mark
 RedTeapot#1960: Why insult people without getting paid
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: we invoked him. SCATTER
 BadPiggy#5202: Speak of the devil
 Redline#7370: hi mark
 Merus#7019: oh, uh, hi Mark
 Mark Brown#6982: Doing a lecture tomorrow, as it happens!
 Merus#7019: but mostly he's a front for Slam
 Merus#7019: he does speaking engagements and consulting for games companies on occasion, and presumably they're paid
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: (orange names lore this goes to the orange book 📙)
 Merus#7019: Mark does have other jobs, mind
 RedTeapot#1960: He summons the patrons
 DrNukeLear#2414: He does with the money he earns from Orange names.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: 🍊
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: I mean in the shop when he buys them
 SquidGeneral10#4090: plus making mad bank, like I'm assuming the creators of factori did
 RedTeapot#1960: People with orange usernames do
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: We do.
 BadPiggy#5202: (cough)Troll(cough)
 darlingS#1797: Do tax collectors collect taxes? Because I assume that would be like being your own patreon
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: huh
and then who pays for his food and stuff?
 Lawn#1538: It is everything.
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: MARKS ROLE IS GOOD
 DrNukeLear#2414: Your right he doesn’t pay himself.
 Merus#7019: Mark is not a patron of himself. Money flows _to_ the Mark
 BadPiggy#5202: Imagine giving yourself money
 NotExplosive#0002: smh my head
 Lawn#1538: He's got the Marks role buddy.
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: Guys I checked and Mark doesn't have the patron role 👀
 Lawn#1538: ^^^
 Merus#7019: also, you get to see how sassy he is in reality, which you only see bits of here in this channel
 BadPiggy#5202: Kickstarter ain't only for games
 SquidGeneral10#4090: I had no idea, I thought it was just a shout out in the video
 Merus#7019: you get to see secret Mark business
 BadPiggy#5202: Geegaz got a shirt if you remember lol
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: I said that
Patreon is for content creators
Kickstarter for games
But autocorrect sucks and must die
 SquidGeneral10#4090: there were prizes like that at any point?!
 Lawn#1538: Plus you get to meet Grag.
 BadPiggy#5202: Apparently not
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: Wait is there some kind of prize like that? So cool!!!
 Merus#7019: and less good conversations with me
 SquidGeneral10#4090: I suppose you're helping support his gamedev efforts, yeah. but patreon isn't really for up-and-coming gamedev projects, as far as I know
 BadPiggy#5202: No point starting a patreon if no one knows you yet. Gotta build up a following first
And Kickstarter isn't only for games
 Lawn#1538: and there are some great conversations to be had with like-minded gamer folks
 ron0studios#4591: will there be a hoodie/t-shirt prize this year?
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: And kickstarter is like for games?
 Lawn#1538: Cause it's $1.
 SquidGeneral10#4090: in mark's case, you also get to stay in this server after the jam is finished
 Lawn#1538: You get cool rooms to talk to fellow game appreciators.
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: I mean general patreon
Why should I start or join one
 SquidGeneral10#4090: you throw moneys at your favourite content creator so they can continue making content that you enjoy
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: honestly, i just wanna give myself a patron role and do nothing ever
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: (and I killed the chat yay)
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: guys what patreon is used to?
 SquidGeneral10#4090: 🧀
 DrNukeLear#2414: Vote for Davi! Vote for moderation in moderation.
 BadPiggy#5202: This party's getting crazy
LET'S ROCK
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: 
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Finish the fight.
 Merus#7019: there goes that man
 BadPiggy#5202: A man of few words
No wonder he's the action man
 Merus#7019: our penance is having to read everything people say, no matter how silly
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Bye
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Yup
 SquidGeneral10#4090: it really is
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: this is funny and stupid
I don't think it's that easy buddy
 Merus#7019: uh, Slam, did we leave you on the yup-or-nope setting again?
 BadPiggy#5202: Yunup
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Slam with the yups and the nups
 Dagi#2077: 😂atleast i tried :)
 SquidGeneral10#4090: darn mods, on their ivory towers
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Yup
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Nope
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: and you become  a patron by subscribing in patreon?
 Dagi#2077: Hi i would like to apply for moderator role!
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Yup
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Nope
 theChief#0001: it's not something you can disable on a per-role basis I don't think! Mods are just immune 😂
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Bye
 Dagi#2077: Do mods have slow mode?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Yup
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: Guys do patrons have slow mode in the jam channels?
 theChief#0001: chief needs a day job to pay the mortgage 😉
 Dagi#2077: This is my calm mood
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Boss? I thought you were the chief?
 BadPiggy#5202: 
 Dagi#2077: 💪😤💪😤💪😤💪😤
 einav23#1882: oh
 BadPiggy#5202: ( oinks in friendliness )
 Dagi#2077: LETS GOOOOOOO
 Dagi#2077: BUDDIES
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: Oh it's simple
people who made games in previous jams just submitted them to my jam
or something like that
 SquidGeneral10#4090: There's always people uploading games that they already made to jams. There'll be tons for this jam, too, from people wanting more eyes on their existing games
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: I publish most stuff in itch so I'm ok
 einav23#1882: wdym?
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: yes
and that helped me ban a lot of games by fakers in my jam
 SquidGeneral10#4090: yes, but on portfolios, you'd have to make note of the date yourself
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: oh yeah i dont want employers to look at the super scuffed shmup game i made from a space invaders sprite shoot for a self-imposed jam, but i do look back on it fondly honestly Because it's super scuffed
 einav23#1882: when uploading to itch you get a date
 SquidGeneral10#4090: it helps to put dates on things, too, lol
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: Imagine looking back to your eons old Scratch games
 theChief#0001: if my boss did that I think I'd die
 theChief#0001: yeah it's definitely a journey - but you don't want prospective employers to be using your first games as a judge of your current ability 😂
 SquidGeneral10#4090: It's something I've done with my portfolio, it's seen about 10 projects over the years but I limit the visible ones to 6. Keeps it to the strongest ones, and makes the website more accessible
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: I do keep doing jams!! I have participated in 3-4 totally and will participate in the gmtk
 einav23#1882: 👌
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i think it's good to develop a mindset of like. general apathy and looking at your previous games and projects as progress towards what you're doing today
 SquidGeneral10#4090: Itch allows you to show / hide projects, so I'd take full advantage of that feature 👍
 theChief#0001: we can't advise on specifics! Here's Mark's clarification on the rules
 SquidGeneral10#4090: You'll have to disclose that it was made before the jam, but I think that's alright.
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: True, and I do have a itch page for my games
Also I just realised I have made 3 games, but the one is junk and I act like it doesn't exist
 einav23#1882: its okay to start making art before if i have an idea that i might want to create right?
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: You also know I started gamedev this year right? My first game was finished in the easter vacation
 einav23#1882: ^ very true
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: actually I finished only 2, but we have the GMTK jam coming and I already think of a game to work now, in the summer
 SquidGeneral10#4090: Even if it's an itch page, WiX website, or google drive, having your stuff *somewhere* you can show it off or just refer back to it is useful, IMO.
 einav23#1882: prob no, maybe make a list in notepad or something tho so when you build your portfolio you can remember
 DrNukeLear#2414: That’s a really good idea.
 SquidGeneral10#4090: Portfolio is always a good idea!
 theChief#0001: jam games included
 theChief#0001: how many games have you made so far?
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: I was really wondering, I am a teenager now and I don't need a portofolio or something, but should I start making one and put any project I make so it isn't hard to remember them when in some stage of my life I need to make one??
 DrNukeLear#2414: He would have already have asked a question. Carry on Sam.
 einav23#1882: what if i would have said no?
 DrNukeLear#2414: By all means
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: guys can I ask something?
 Werewolf#5455: Best of Luck to everyone willing to participate this year
 Jeker#3389: I am moving a part around.
 Jeker#3389: Now, how did I fix that? With the most stupid way imaginable to man
 Jeker#3389: ok so, animations in my game no longer look scuffed (I was dealing with rotation, and animations, so yeah)
 Dave_BBX#4939: Hi
 MrBen#0001: 🏔️
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: boolean maths i can roll with at least. we did it like in ten different kinds of ways throughout just the two years of CS
 Zoro5168#0115: Ohk
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: exclusive or - if you know the OR operator, that operator is true if either value is true or if both are true. XOR is only if one or the other is true
 JuliusCube#8501: so its basically OR except cant be both
 Zoro5168#0115: Whats an XOR
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: both values at either end of the operator have to be the same for the truth table to be true. it's the opposite of an XOR, basically
 JuliusCube#8501: thats literally the only thing i understand from there
 Zoro5168#0115: Ohk
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: strict implication
 JuliusCube#8501: if and only if
 Zoro5168#0115:  what does this thing mean
 JuliusCube#8501: okay fair point i dont expect anyone to get this except that one guy who brought up "the terminal object in the category of integers with morphisms Hom(a,b) given by the relation of a | b  E k in Z: k*a = b"
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: probably a set of numbers put through a composition of tan and sqrt i guess
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i mean. Yes. i mean the sequence
 JuliusCube#8501: its a graph
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i'm in college and i have no idea what this is lmao
 JuliusCube#8501: okay fair point
 Zoro5168#0115: Yea thats why i cant solve it
 Redline#7370: like we learned tan in 9th grade 😩
 JuliusCube#8501: use the other 2 hints goddamit its not that hard
 Redline#7370: good question I'm not smart enough for these
 JuliusCube#8501: indeed it is. but what does it mean?
 BadPiggy#5202: Someday Chief. Someday lol
 theChief#0001: and more
 theChief#0001: if you like aria, dawn is just that but better 😂
 Redline#7370: hmm yes it's an image of desmos
 theChief#0001: says the piggy that hasn't played dawn
 darlingS#1797: I just like the music of Castlevania
 BadPiggy#5202: Aria of sorrow is still the best
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: Dracula's infinite reserve of wine glasses
 darlingS#1797: That's the one
 Redline#7370: no we want the solution (insert kekw here)
 darlingS#1797: Imagine tanning at all
 JuliusCube#8501: do you guys want a hint 3 then?
 DrNukeLear#2414: I’m pretty pale, but I end up tanning to what looks like a Middle Eastern complexion.
 darlingS#1797: What the a man but a miserable pile of secrets. But enough talk, have at you!
 Zoro5168#0115: When i saw hint 1 i gave up
 JuliusCube#8501: guys you should really use the hints for that one if you want to solve it
 lilburlap#8480: You ever wonder why we're here?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: what's the definition of a game?
 JuliusCube#8501: nope its incorrect
well its a correct continuation but its not the one im looking for
 Zoro5168#0115: *just to suffer*
 darlingS#1797: "Okay so how bad do you sunburn on a scale from snowman costume to lobster costume"
 Redline#7370: what's down? what's the meaning of life? why are we here?
 Wokarol#0940: Not much, just making a new mortal enemy
 Zoro5168#0115: Maths
 akaBl4ck#7384: what's up
 JuliusCube#8501: lemme check, probably not
 Tapu#9161: I just asked Wolfram to continue the sequence
 JuliusCube#8501: yes... but there are other mathematically correct solutions
 DrNukeLear#2414: It’s when the police see you and call animal control over a six foot lobster you need to worry.
 Tapu#9161:  is this correct?
 Zoro5168#0115: Who the hell uses abcd xyz where its at
 darlingS#1797: Boom, instant red amogus cosplay when I walk out the house from sunburns
 JuliusCube#8501: i prefer a,b,c,d but ill give you half credit
 darlingS#1797: I may have lived in Australia my whole life but I have the pale skin of Dracula and burn up to match
 BadPiggy#5202: I wonder what the peeps outside in the other patreon exclusive chats think about this chat lol
 Zoro5168#0115: x,y,z,w
 MagicSteve#6162: The perks of being a solo is that you have freedom with what you want to make, but the perks of being in a team means less work but also less freedom
 JuliusCube#8501: imagine using matlab
 Wokarol#0940: 344, 611, 633, 655, 677, 699, **0.0019e+9, 0.0316e+9, 0.2828e+9, 1.8064e+9, ...**
Approximately
 darlingS#1797: Then I have no advice because I was gonna say definitely team if it was your first oops
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: $50/frame
 Lawn#1538: I'm amused that the contents of your insides is turkey.
 MagicSteve#6162: no, I've been to many jams
 JuliusCube#8501: what is your frame rate? 10^(-17) fps?
 Redline#7370: do whatever you are more experienced in that's the safe option
 Tapu#9161: I'm becoming a cooked turkey sausage
 Tapu#9161: It's too hot outside today
 KΛΛWΛΝ#7763: imagine using seconds to mesure time, sike *laugh in gamer*
 darlingS#1797: Is it your first jam?
 Lawn#1538: It's most certainly a heat wave. Make sure you slip, slop, slap.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i know of people from the north of europe who'll go full blast with the AC if it's 20°c
 MagicSteve#6162: I don't know if I want to dothis jam solo or on a team
 Zoro5168#0115: Laughs in india
 JuliusCube#8501: well not that bad as in I can handle it.
 darlingS#1797: I may be used to heat but it doesn't mean I like 50 freaking degrees Celsius
 JuliusCube#8501: its a heat wave probably
 Redline#7370: nah it's like you go outside and you burn down in like 3 frames
 Lawn#1538: 36 is pretty high for Europe bud.
 JuliusCube#8501: 36 isnt that bad
 darlingS#1797: Also yeah that hurt
 Lawn#1538: Ayy, me too.
 JuliusCube#8501: bonus challenge for the people who have no life:
what are the next 4 terms of this sequence:
1, 14, 36, 58, 80, 168, 190, 212, 234, 256, 278, 300, 322, 344, 611, 633, 655, 677, 699
this one's actually difficult. Its actually not on the OEIS.
Hint 1: ||tan||
Hint 2: ||sqrt||
if you do solve it, you probably were using the hints.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: spring is 25°C on average for me
 Zoro5168#0115: 31 is like spring for me real heat comes with 40°
 darlingS#1797: Okay but I am not the universe my languages are music, memes, and panic
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: /\\(°,,°) /\\< bat
 Lawn#1538: Recently I think
 Lawn#1538:  did you get to experience that 50⁰C day in WA?
 darlingS#1797: °W°
 Redline#7370: In hungary we had summer for like 3 weeks with temps as high as 36°C and now we are at 21°C what is this
 Lawn#1538: Nothing at all, math is great. *"It's the language of the universe"*
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i wish it was just autumn and spring forever without summer or winter in the middle
 Zoro5168#0115: °°°°°°°°°°○°°°°°°°°°°
 darlingS#1797: Mobile phone
 DrNukeLear#2414: I wonder if I could move to Iceland for the weekend.
 Lyfe#8258: How tf are all of you typing the ° symbol
 JuliusCube#8501: yes indeed. it was. kinda.
 Zoro5168#0115: Feels normal to me
 darlingS#1797: Lol imagine being in summer
 JuliusCube#8501: its sunny in the uk? impossible!
 Wokarol#0940: The sequence was on there... kinda
 Zoro5168#0115: 32°
 darlingS#1797: Math
 JuliusCube#8501: whats wrong with math
 Redline#7370: so based
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: 31°C/87°F
 Lyfe#8258: But where I am it's just 18
 Lawn#1538: *checks general, sees math again, rolls eyes*
 JuliusCube#8501: australia moment
 Lyfe#8258: Back home apparently its 30 but also raining
 JuliusCube#8501: its 22 C for me
 darlingS#1797: 11°C it's 9 pm and winter and I am freezing
 Redline#7370: **fun daily question time:**
temperature check, how many °C you got outside? I have 21°C here somehow and I'm cold af
 JuliusCube#8501: correct, now that i think about it it isnt too hard.
 darlingS#1797: The most numbers I know are plot based arc numbers, *Eva* units, Amoongus' Pokedex number and the funny numbers /hj
 Wokarol#0940: ||  1     4     4     9    25    25    25    36    49    81    81    81   121   121   121   144   196   225   225   289   289   289   289   289   400   484   484   484   576 ||?
 JuliusCube#8501: this sequence isnt on there btw im not that stupid
it makes this challenge way easier
 darlingS#1797: I haven't thought about maths in so long my brain is instead think about last terms integrated science test
 JuliusCube#8501: no i dont think so
 JuliusCube#8501: idk just feel free to use whatever you want as long as you get the right answer
 darlingS#1797: Nvm it starts with one
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i just got news yesterday that i barely passed a geometry exam with 1 point above the passing grade so for a while my brain's just not going to think about maths  lmao
 darlingS#1797: Wait a second, are these electron shell numbers?
 BadPiggy#5202: I mean I can still do vector math cus gamedev
But still
 Wokarol#0940: How would that solve cheating?
 BadPiggy#5202: I'm so out of practice with math lol
I used to be good at it
 JuliusCube#8501: online encyclopedia of integer sequences
 Wokarol#0940: oeis?
 JuliusCube#8501: whatever if you get the right solution you get the right solution. no more hints from here on out
 darlingS#1797: In my opinion maths is cheating so do whatever you feel works
 JuliusCube#8501: id say yes
 JuliusCube#8501: should i consider using oeis to solve this cheating?
 Wokarol#0940: Oh right, reaction gifs won't embed
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: The horror.
 darlingS#1797: I don't think numbers I think references and music
 darlingS#1797: Everytime I see a number my brain scans it for 413 dang it
 Wokarol#0940: It's an equation, looks better in matlab but cant post images
 JuliusCube#8501: okay ill give you the point. you found *a* solution that makes sense, but you didnt find the best solution
 Zoro5168#0115: They squares
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: woah that is a whole wall of thext
 Merus#7019: I vaguely recall the answer to this one is insane

 DrNukeLear#2414: I can tell right now that you are the kind of person who likes comparing apples and oranges.
 darlingS#1797: There, I have solved maths
 darlingS#1797: The answer is pomegranate
 BadPiggy#5202: There's a direct solution for this. I forgot what it was lol
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: mhm
 JuliusCube#8501: if you find the right answer keep it in spoilers
 darlingS#1797: Fruit?
 darlingS#1797: For context I stopped doing ATAR/High level maths in early year 11 so I don't know what this is
 JuliusCube#8501: hint: ||what do you notice all the numbers have in common?||
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: 1, 4, 4, 9, 25, 25, 25, 36, 49, 81, 81, 81, 121, 121, 121, 144, 196, 225, 225
first thing i notice is that all of these numbers are squares of other whole numbers
 JuliusCube#8501: the problem with doing that is that the specific fitted function you get is probably not going to actually be similar to the "function" that created the sequence
 darlingS#1797: What the actual fresh heckity heck kind of maths is that
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: Keep the answer in spoilers please? I'm at work for a while yet, would like to have a go when I can 🤓
 darlingS#1797: I would use photoshop to make Barney yellow but I've decided I'm not in the mood to buy or pirate adobe products at 8:46 at night
 JuliusCube#8501: well yeah but here theres one right answer that im looking for
 Wokarol#0940: That sequence when rounded to integers fits the equation:
```
f = - (3987982480510733*x^18)/154742504910672534362390528 + (5905730348577047*x^17)/1208925819614629174706176 - (8090943591472419*x^16)/18889465931478580854784 + (6804963423947437*x^15)/295147905179352825856 - (491539898966701*x^14)/576460752303423488 + (6622295526022009*x^13)/288230376151711744 - (131369522453905*x^12)/281474976710656 + (2053486402422013*x^11)/281474976710656 - (1561958051403315*x^10)/17592186044416 + (116238196326893*x^9)/137438953472 - (6932330106863913*x^8)/1099511627776 + (2514719523989777*x^7)/68719476736 - (5620944397334671*x^6)/34359738368 + (4754289567785993*x^5)/8589934592 - (1481121857810429*x^4)/1073741824 + (5216491967458129*x^3)/2147483648 - (1516306960053093*x^2)/536870912 + (8223164171036871*x)/4294967296 - 2409099032010057/4294967296

 ArcadeEngineer#5120: incorrect? aren't there arbitrarily many ways to produce a given sequence
 JuliusCube#8501: what tf did you do
 JuliusCube#8501: yeah theyre incorrect
 JuliusCube#8501: those dont look correct but lemme check
 Wokarol#0940:  The sequence is as follows:
```
1, 4, 4, 9, 25, 25, 25, 36, 49, 81, 81, 81, 121, 121, 121, 144, 196, 225, 225,
62492, 363260, -2390800, -48664000, ...
```approximately
 darlingS#1797: I'm mainly wondering if Big Birds DNA is closer to actual dinosaur or Barney the dinosaur
 darlingS#1797: But in the bonus features for the DVD, a deleted scene shows Tweety getting hit and turning into a dinosaur
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: that assumes that changing the course of one evolutionary course would automatically just stop the other instead of producing different results that would be unpredictable
 darlingS#1797: The humans who got hit turned into monkeys, so yeah that might be iffy
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: a shrew
not a monkey
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: if it went far back enough to turn big bird into a non-avian dinosaur wouldn't it turn a human into like
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: my sheep brain is fine instead
 BadPiggy#5202: My pig brain hurts thinking about this .....
 darlingS#1797: Actually nvm he has a cousin who's normal size so his height wouldn't factor
 darlingS#1797: But Big Bird is a canary, and is already greatly scaled up, so presumably he ancestors may also have been scaled as such
 Pixstatic#3464: emus are already the appropriate size
 darlingS#1797: Okay but would he be a giant emu or just a normal size
 Pixstatic#3464: not like properly yellow like “lasso selected in photoshop and tinted” yellow
 Pixstatic#3464: he would turn into a yellow emu
 darlingS#1797: I'm still thinking about cassowarys
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: seems fairly simple to me
 BadPiggy#5202: Wat .....
 darlingS#1797: So you all know that looney tunes movie with Brendan Frasier, Looney Tunes Back In Action? If the magic monkey amulet that reverts DNA to a previous species in the evolutionary chain hit Big Bird from Sesame Street, would he turn into an actual dinosaur or Barney, and would he still be abnormally huge?
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: (in some areas where they're endemic you are _required_ to have somebody with a rifle with you outside)
 BadPiggy#5202: This lol.
If a polar bear sees you, well, hope you had a good life
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: (incidentally the large predator which is an exception to this pattern is the polar bear. they don't know what you are but they're pretty sure you're made out of meat)
 Pixstatic#3464: my aunt’s cat is practically a lion
 Pixstatic#3464: lions are so majestic I love them
 Lawn#1538: Lions have got some chill, tigers maybe not.
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: if a lion sees you, it's going to think 'i don't know what that is. i'd better not risk it' if a cape buffalo sees you it's going to go 'don't like that. get the hell away from me'
 Lawn#1538: They should be renamed Bundies.
 Lawn#1538: Horses.
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: the most dangerous animals are usually not predators but large herbivores. hippos are particularly bad. anything with a 'stand and fight' defense strategy (including cattle)
 Lawn#1538: Point still stand, beautiful plumage on the bipedal menace.
 Pixstatic#3464: yeah lmao
 Lawn#1538: Yeah, I'm not sure about that Monty Python GIF now lol
 darlingS#1797: Imagine if Big Bird was a cassowary
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: in some of the same areas where you've got wild cattle like banteng there is absolutely no way it's the most dangerous animal
 Pixstatic#3464: the vibe of this server during jam time is changed substantially by the sprinkling of link emojis
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: at the end of the day it's still just a big bird. it weighs less than you do
 darlingS#1797: Welcome to Jurassic Park *cue cassowarys running past*
 Lawn#1538: yeah I'm not sure about this Monty Python GIF now lol
 Pixstatic#3464: they kinda look like really big deadly stupid pigeons with rocks on their heads idk
 Lawn#1538: Yeah you definitely don't want to mess with a living dinosaur.
 JuliusCube#8501: if its the right solution, its the right solution.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I mean they are really beautiful, but super dangerous
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: the species distribution there doesn't make sense otherwise
 darlingS#1797: Again, I still think magpies are worse
 Lawn#1538: Maybe they already have...
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: it used to be pretty common in papua new guinea to capture cassowaries and move them around in a semi-feral state for (presumably) ritual food purposes
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: What if someone weaponized rabies?
 Lawn#1538: They live in the rainforests way up north. I think I've only seen one, and that was at the reptile park.
 Wokarol#0940: Give me a moment to pull up matlab and solve it in the stupidest but correct way
 Pixstatic#3464: ah yeah right. Rabies is much scarier if you consider the possibility of something small biting you without you noticing
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: cassowarys are terrifying
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: *Damn...*
 darlingS#1797: At least we didn't have to fight cassowarys. We wouldn't even be here if they decided to wage war
 Wokarol#0940:  // For some kids it really is just a child fear, not for all of course.
Last time I feared a spider was when playing Grounded but that doesn't count
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: No its not an easy disease but like if you get bitten by something they can do a preventative thing for the best
 JuliusCube#8501: every day i post a "math" question here. This is day #3:
continue the sequence for 5 more terms:
1, 4, 4, 9, 25, 25, 25, 36, 49, 81, 81, 81, 121, 121, 121, 144, 196, 225, 225
if anyone actually solves this correctly ill be incredibly impressed.
 Pixstatic#3464: I’ve lived here my whole life and the only time I have ever seen a wild emu was in a residential area in emu park
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: And it isn't even a good story!
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: It's not even done!
 BadPiggy#5202: Hmm..... Yes ....
The floor is made of floor
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I'm not telling that would be spoiling my own story :3 (that no one except the people from the event will read but like yknow what I mean)
 MrBen#0001: huh
 Pixstatic#3464: I went to emu park a while ago and saw an actual emu… kinda blew my mind that emu park has emus in it
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: *Not yet...*
 Lawn#1538: Not many here.
 Lawn#1538: It happened on your side of the country too lol
 Pixstatic#3464: not after developing symptoms tho
 darlingS#1797: There are too many emus
 theChief#0001: it is the single best written wikipedia page that exists, it's not even a contest
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: treatable as in you can go to hospital and they'll stick a needle into your stomach and give you stuff to make it go away. then you leave hospital no longer having rabies
 Pixstatic#3464: ew I smell murder in here! who murdered?!
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: there is a treatment regimen for after people develop symptoms but it only barely works. like you go from 'going to die' to 'almost definitely going to die'
 Lawn#1538: This is my favourite war. Spoiler alert: ||the emus won||
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Writing a murder mystery in 4500 words is a pain tho.
 Pixstatic#3464: do you mean treatable like shots or treatable like “freezing people alive because idk might work”
 theChief#0001: I love that within three comments, they bring up the emu war
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I didn't do the murder. I just wrote the murder.
 BadPiggy#5202: Loooool
Yup. This is the one
 darlingS#1797: CALLED IT
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Thanks. I hope my murder mystery turns out decent, it's for an event
 Pixstatic#3464: sorry for the spoilers but I think Emi did it
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: rabies is terrifying and even that is treatable, although the treatment for it is also rough as hell
 darlingS#1797: Oh so murder mystery writing
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: 
 TheGerkuman#0091: Emi, please stay ~~while I call the police~~
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: no just very rabies-like bat viruses!
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Welp I'm going back to solving a murder. That I created.
 TheGerkuman#0091: Thankfully no rabies here in the UK, but still. Aaagh.
 Wokarol#0940: You need to train your Google jutsu
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Phobia talk is... mostly.... fine, (make sure to use spoiler tags if needed). However lets not allow this to morph into a political discussion as its not appropriate for this channel.
 Pixstatic#3464: it’s probably good to address before people turn it into a personality trait I guess? Like before they develop the self awareness that they know they are afraid of spiders as opposed to actually finding them scary if that makes sense
 darlingS#1797: Just once I want to see a horror villain get taking out by a hardened bogan (translation: bogan = Australian redneck)
 TheGerkuman#0091: Tbh, the scariest thing to me is rabies
 Princent Vice#4280: Bears and wolves will leave you alone at least 🤣
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: except comb jellies don't fuck with those
 Wokarol#0940: Yeah, but there were probably people in hospital because of them
 Princent Vice#4280: As do phobias
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: yeah the actual danger from almost all venomous animals is heavily exaggerated
 Lawn#1538: You have bears, wolves, ~~and other Americans too.~~
 BadPiggy#5202: Old habits die hard
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Hello Shadow.
 CALSYTHE#6648: we have spider cops
 Princent Vice#4280: I suppose I don’t know about “most” kids but anyone I know who was scared of spiders as a kid is still scared of them as adults
We don’t even have scary spiders here
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Seems like fun.
 TheGerkuman#0091: Lightning *is* scary!
 MrBen#0001: true
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: labbing combos in ggacpr
 Lawn#1538: The USA is scarrier tbh..
 Pixstatic#3464: lightning is so fckin cool man I wish it was storming outside
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Hi Emi!
 darlingS#1797: Talking about Australia
 Lawn#1538: No one has died from a spider in like 60 years.
 TheGerkuman#0091: I'm afraid of venomous animals, and I'm not afraid to say it
 darlingS#1797: You say that but I personally am still scared of lightning. It's more of a sensory processing thing, but still
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: What's everyone doing?
 Wokarol#0940: I mean, it's not phobia but a general fear kids have.  Basically "darkness ain't as scary as you think" but with spiders. Which mostly works outside Australia
 MrBen#0001: hey
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Hello
 Lawn#1538: Haha, depends where you grow up. Just like anywhere really.
 BadPiggy#5202: Damn it, I can't find that meme
Oh well
 TheGerkuman#0091: Not to the extent that the media makes them out to be, though.
 Pixstatic#3464: I exist to prove that statement wrong
 TheGerkuman#0091: Aussies seem to be generally pretty hardened
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: My room is filled with spiders.
 Pixstatic#3464: I hate when people assume this lol my brain is capable of conflating an entirely safe (but giant) huntsman spider into a horrific unpredictable demonic mass of legs
 darlingS#1797: I'm not saying spiders aren't scary, I just know a lot less Australians that are scared than people born in other countries who moved here
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Gang gang
 CALSYTHE#6648: i feel like i have to apologize to the crows for my mom's behavior
 Lawn#1538: She's not in the ~~gang~~ murder.
 TheGerkuman#0091: Oh for sure. But the Australian government doesn't want kids being blasé with spiders.
 CALSYTHE#6648: this is true.  crows and i get along well.  crows will dive at my mom.
 Lawn#1538: I do not want this reality.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: something not being venomous has nothing to do with how scary someone finds something
 TheGerkuman#0091: Imagine a venomous magpie...
 Lawn#1538: But once they're your mate, you're in the bird club for life.
 Lawn#1538: yeah magpies can give you a hard time
 Princent Vice#4280: Lot of people “shouldn’t” have phobias, what a silly premise for a show. “Your phobia is illogical and you should feel bad for feeling it”
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: if somebody wants to eat the spiders that's their right, damnit
 Pixstatic#3464: Magpies are great stfu
 darlingS#1797: Magpies are worse in my opinion
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: to be fair i'm sure that venomous spiders are probably also poisonous
 TheGerkuman#0091: Pedantic, aren't we
 Pixstatic#3464: yeah no you walk through the neighbourhood and you’ll pass at least a dozen spiders that could kill you and that isn’t even a jovial exaggeration
 Lawn#1538: venomous
 TheGerkuman#0091: And sure, in the UK kids really shouldn't be scared of spiders. We don't have any poisonous ones.
But Australia has lots.
 CALSYTHE#6648: what if they pick me up and throw me outside?!?
 TheGerkuman#0091: They banned an episode of Peppa Pig in Australia because it said that kids shouldn't be afraid of spiders.
 Lawn#1538: Pick em up (normally with a bowl and piece of paper), throw em outside.
 darlingS#1797: They're pretty normal here
 Lawn#1538: Spiders are fine.
 Pixstatic#3464: I *hate* spiders
 darlingS#1797: Y'all are just scared
 Pixstatic#3464: horrific little eldritch nightmares and you can’t do anything but let them be
 Not Trout#7714: the demons were scared ot hte spiders
 Pixstatic#3464: the spiders in this godforsaken country
 BadPiggy#5202: I think there was a meme on Reddit for it. Let me find it
 Pixstatic#3464: they’re native here
 BadPiggy#5202: I remember in DOOM eternal, on the world map, the demons didn't even go near Australia lol
 BadPiggy#5202: My pig brain can't comprehend these geography jokes
 Pixstatic#3464: well australia also doesn’t exist so it doesn’t matter too much lol
 CALSYTHE#6648: i'm a little behind on my flat-earth understandings  😄
 darlingS#1797: I guessed it was an upside down joke I just didn't know what loops meant
 Pixstatic#3464: but the equator is just a circle around australia
 TheGerkuman#0091: Ngl, I tend to just misread NSW as NSFW
 Lawn#1538: Apparently our for loops run backwards too.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: while loops are eeeeeevil. I'm joking, but yeah I really dislike using them a lot
 Lawn#1538: They are making a joke about Australia ~~being upside down.~~ toilets running backwards.
 CALSYTHE#6648: bad joke that everything is opposite south of the equator
 Lawn#1538: Nice, hello from the NSW.
 darlingS#1797: Also what does this mean? If it's a Sydney thing idk
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: we all know that instead of doing `while() `loops australians only do `do{} while();` loops
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: for sure, good luck with it
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: is it not visa debit?
 darlingS#1797: For lack of explaining suburbs to everyone else here, yes
 CALSYTHE#6648: can you stop writing for loops backwards?
 Lawn#1538: I'd switch banks lol.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Although I'm glad that's not the way it works here, it would suck to have to get a credit card just to use paypal or other services
 Pixstatic#3464: I’m with suncorp and for whatever reason the card they issued me does not work for subscriptions whatsoever so neither patreon nor paypal can charge it for that
 Lawn#1538: You're in Perf?
 Lawn#1538: Ayy
 darlingS#1797: I am the Australian on my team
 Lawn#1538: Dope
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I have an Australian on my team
 Lawn#1538: ING, Greater, Commbank, all gucci.
 Lawn#1538: I too am Australian.
 Pixstatic#3464: I’m Australian my bank just sucks and I have like their least applicable account option
 Lawn#1538: I don't even have a credit card. I've used PayPal with debit for like 10 years.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: No, it might be something to do with the country you are in but its not a default rule of paypal everywhere
 Princent Vice#4280: The only option would be buying prepaid visas and that’s a whole kettle of fish
 BadPiggy#5202: I'ma play as many games as I can when I'm free before the jam so that I have some decent ideas going forward kek
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: ehh why be anxious? i have a starfinder thing today and probaaaaaaably a date tomorrow for me and my SO's fifth year anniversary so i have stuff to do before the jam. no need to be anxious, just do stuff! in the end a game jam isn't that big of a deal
 Princent Vice#4280: PayPal doesn’t accept a lot of German or Russian cards. This isn’t the first time I’ve heard this
 Pixstatic#3464: subscriptions work funny, it’s definitely a thing my friend
 darlingS#1797: The jam is the only time I'll willingly wake up at 1 am
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: thats definitely not a thing, a lot of people use paypal without a credit card
 Princent Vice#4280: My steam deck arrives tomorrow so I’ll have a good distraction for the next 2x days. Just have to get through this miserable Tuesday
 BadPiggy#5202: Argh. 3 more days of anxiety
And work
 SlamBamActionman#7160: *and 50 minutes
 MrBen#0001: hey
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: 3 days and four hours for everyone
 Batuhan#3662: oh thank you
 Lawn#1538: That's odd, I only use debit card too. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 TheGerkuman#0091: What time is it now for you, Batuhan?
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: the itch page automatically displays the start time in your local time
 BadPiggy#5202: Shouldn't it be according to your time zone on the itch page ?
 Pixstatic#3464: patreon does not accept it by proxy of paypal either since I only use a debit card and not credit
 Batuhan#3662: so ım living in turkey when does the game jam starts exactly day and hour for me?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: they are easy to find online, what are you looking for?
 Batuhan#3662: does anyone know different timezones
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i code, i design, i write, i write music, and i do pixel art. somtimes i paint too!
 Lawn#1538: PayPal?
 Batuhan#3662: Hi
 Pixstatic#3464: patreon doesn’t accept cards from my bank so I guess I’ll have to update my nickname…
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: lol
 BadPiggy#5202: Argh no damn it lol
I can't escape the influence of from software wherever I go
 darlingS#1797: I make sick beats, and by that I mean heist music battle themes and jazz covers of Accumula Town/Furret Walk
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: vaati vidya games?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: last joke on this: if you are not a patron you do not get any pronouns privileges. sorry!
 Pixstatic#3464: ah right, my mistake
 BadPiggy#5202: We make vidya gaems
 TheGerkuman#0091: Yeep. I think I'm gonna have to go onto the team finder and look for some more opportunities. Not sure I'm gonna be the right fit for the first one I was interested in. They need someone with more unity experience than me, I think. (unless they want me to be a junior designer, which I'd be ok with lol)
 CALSYTHE#6648: *they all make games
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: oh sorry there seems to have been some kind of misunderstanding. i make videoedgames
 BadPiggy#5202: ***No***
 Pixstatic#3464: anyway, now that our insightful and ‘genuine’ foray into the English language has concluded… we all make videogames, right?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: *on the site
 CALSYTHE#6648: so.... about that Jam?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Try logging in and logging out, could be that the validation isn't updating for some reason
 Math N#6097:  Cant seem to be able to post a thread in the TeamFinder App. Keeps asking me to turn on privacy setting in Discord, which I did.
 JuliusCube#8501: thats probably a good idea
 Mark Brown#6982: Anyway, cleared up! Let's move on 😄
 JuliusCube#8501: ... which is why i dont consider it a problem.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: "He can do that" <- who can do that?
"They can do that" <- who can do that?
Same different aside from someone who doesn't identify as "he" is also included and seen in the second option
 Pixstatic#3464: well when you reply to a message it’s usually enough context to piece together which of the billions of male humans he could be referring to
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: like, which of the ten people in this conversation right now or potentially hundreds of lurkers do you mean by 'he'
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: and without that 'he' isn't really any less ambiguous
 CALSYTHE#6648: they can say whatever they wants
 JuliusCube#8501: well yeah which is why i dont consider it a big problem
 Pixstatic#3464: eh take it up with the authors of English
 Princent Vice#4280: 💯
 Mark Brown#6982: In the context of a full sentence it's usually always clear
 darlingS#1797: If you aren't a patreon people just can't refer to you at all without excruciating details to ensure it's the right person /j
 JuliusCube#8501: "they" makes it ambiguous to whether you're taking about 1 or multiple people but thats less of a problem imo.
 Pixstatic#3464: I just like being able to go “haha it would be cool if the camera was kinda here-ish in this area” and it works
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Not everyone knows the same conventions and not everyone is very familiar with how discord works, lets not be sarcastic about people asking genuine good-faith questions
 CALSYTHE#6648: i too love they
 DrNukeLear#2414: I keep slipping and defaulting to “his”, will keep trying lol
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: thank you mark. i love pronouns
 CALSYTHE#6648: nice!  i actually worked with Cinebot, the predecessor to CineMachine.  it was really fun to learn those systems.  this was my first foray into doing any kind of camera work in a game.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: it's not easy to tell how to refer to someone online with just a username so people put the information into their names to be helpful. Anyone can edit their username in the discord settings. Also rather than "his" consider using the default of "they" as it's more inclusive 🙂
 manis#4282: yeah yeah i get it. Ok thanks for informing me :-))
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: mark brown personally invented pronouns for his patron discord server
 Pixstatic#3464: Cinemachine is a godsend tho, actually makes cameras fun sometimes
 JuliusCube#8501: its just a custom to do online. Just write your pronouns after your name or in your bio
 manis#4282: oh i see :-
 DrNukeLear#2414: It seemed to be a convention here, I just adopted it. Works well. Would recommend to others.
 manis#4282: ...
 darlingS#1797: I can't speak for actually coding cameras, but they seem like a pain and that's why I just make funny music and cry when I think it would be good to write a song in 11/8
 CALSYTHE#6648: i had a designer try to overwork the camera during combat sequences... just made everything worse
 JuliusCube#8501: no, its a feature of the english language
 manis#4282: so it's a feature of this server??
 Pixstatic#3464: literally just moving the camera by like 0.1 m can completely change the feeling of momentum and energy in a game
 DrNukeLear#2414: They’re called pronouns. It’s a declaration of how the discorder identifies themselves so that people get it right.
For now I'd recommend people put links in the description like they have been doing 👍
 CALSYTHE#6648: 1000% understand 😄
 Pixstatic#3464: I love hate cameras
 CALSYTHE#6648: hehe.  we used to sell everything with game cameras on some games.  collision with railroad tracks?  camera.
 Pixstatic#3464: I have nightmares about game cameras
 manis#4282: why is everyone here revealing his gender??
 CALSYTHE#6648: Of course.  A fully featured dynamic game camera will have hundreds of states and behaviors.  It's really complex.  I used to work with the guy who made CineMachine.
 Wokarol#0940: They mention in that talk tricks like "Camera moves closer, but some objects like pillars are ignored and camera instead rotates"
 darlingS#1797: It has to serve aesthetics
 BadPiggy#5202: You can have a meh-looking game, but a dynamic camera when done right does most of the heavy lifting for you in terms of visuals lol
 CALSYTHE#6648: #1 thing in this video.. distracting players.
 darlingS#1797: It all depends on how the camera is used
 Wokarol#0940: Yesn't. In Journey I think you always can affect the camera tho. But it will move on it's own
 Princent Vice#4280: Are you participating this year,  ?
 darlingS#1797: I think it depends on the use of the camera though. Personally, I look to Pokemon BW, and I remember Skyarrow bridge
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i tried dabbling in binary stuff for game maker once and it was fun but the complexity of it surpassed the need to super-optimize my games
 TheGerkuman#0091: It all depends on the game type, IMO. 2D stuff often can get away with not letting the player have control
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: for some stuff you definitely need to have an idea about how e.g. cache works. something you come across pretty quicj if you ever write a ray tracer
 BadPiggy#5202: Frik, God of war does it masterfully
 CALSYTHE#6648: there are exceptions
 BadPiggy#5202: Not true
OG silent hill does it beautifully and creates tension at every moment
 CALSYTHE#6648: (probably)
 CALSYTHE#6648: biggest camera mistake = always taking control of the camera from your players
 TheGerkuman#0091: I didn't enjoy my time at uni. But that's partly because I'm just not stable enough to live by myself, unassisted. And I stupidly thought I could. I was a hermited wreck by the end of my three years...
 Wokarol#0940: 1h talk about cameras in games
"50 Game Camera Mistakes"
 BadPiggy#5202: Frik. No but I'ma watch it.
I've only seen the talks by the Devs of DOOM 2016 and the Dev of downwell lol
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: one day i'll be smart enough to actually use binary stuff in code but since my games for now won't need that degree of optimisation i'll stay away
 Wokarol#0940: Did you see the GDC talk from the makers of Journey?
 BadPiggy#5202: F
 darlingS#1797: I kid you not, it was foggy a few weeks ago and I genuinely thought I should adjust the render distance
 darlingS#1797: Birds flying past as the camera proceeds to clip halfway through a rock because dynamic cameras are notoriously hard to code apparently
 darlingS#1797: Watching out into the distance as you see another mountain you can probably climb if it isn't BOTW and raining
 darlingS#1797: Cue the stock standard open world over-the-shoulder camera angle
 BadPiggy#5202: Camera angles intrigue me
Let it be games, movies or photography
 darlingS#1797: Also obligatory non-binary pun about coding in binary
 BadPiggy#5202: Ooo
I've always kinda wanted to look more into cinematography tbh
 Wokarol#0940: Fair, I love it tho. Seeing your stuff exist in our real meat world is just so satisfying
 darlingS#1797: The most computer based course I've ever done is media arts, and that just got me more into photography
 theChief#0001: the binary stuff is still incredibly useful for me day to day, and you learn a lot about optimisation
 BadPiggy#5202: The rest is umm...... Can't comment cus I forgot
 BadPiggy#5202: I had computer hardware topics as well lol.
About the only stuff which was important was how cycles and disks work tbh
 darlingS#1797: When I say small I mean comparatively
 BadPiggy#5202: I'm glad I stayed away from electronics lol. Any form of electrical engineering nearly killed me back in my first year of uni.
I'm speaking both literally and in terms of marks
 theChief#0001: you missed out on literally nothing. I did a degree in computer science for games and learned nothing that I hadn't already taught myself (with regards to programming)
the stuff I didn't teach myself
- history of computing, which is kinda interesting but doesn't improve your skills
- computer hardware stuff, which is actually super useful but not _necessary_, and you can still get all of the knowledge online anyway
- that's it
 darlingS#1797: The furthest I want to go is Lena Raine or Toby Fox levels: mainly work on small indie games and occasionally write a bit for a much bigger projects like Pokemon or Minecraft
 Wokarol#0940: The only overlap is that you sometimes write code for PLC or Robots
 BadPiggy#5202: Ooof
 Wokarol#0940: I didn't even go that route, I do automatics and robotics.
 BadPiggy#5202: Aye, I could never do gamedev outside of the kind of games I make lol
 Wokarol#0940: Cannot agree more
 TheGerkuman#0091: It's why I'm just interested as a hobbyist
 BadPiggy#5202: Software dev does the same lol
 TheGerkuman#0091: Anyway, the industry would've killed my adhd/autistic/depressed arse.
I have little to no formal education related to game development
 darlingS#1797: Didn't expect them to be good. Most art based classes are terrible anyway
 TheGerkuman#0091: I don't think a single member of my graduation year remains in game dev
 BadPiggy#5202: I mean I went to uni for computer science anyway. Just did ( and still do ) gamedev for fun
 TheGerkuman#0091: I can tell you from experience that a lot of game dev courses aren't very good
 BadPiggy#5202: Lol. Noice
 darlingS#1797: Lol imagine having any courses related to gaming. I self taught music writing and I happened to have a class for how to write resumes
 darlingS#1797: Also state any future plans. If you plan on going into a game design uni course, say it. This doesn't fully work for short periods of time such as jams or commissions, but it shows initiative
 TheGerkuman#0091: I got my 2:1 from turning a failing final project into a just passing project. This is what I meant by putting out fires. I would not wanna put that product on my portfolio XD
It's why I'm looking for just one of these jam things to be a successs for me, even a small one.
 BadPiggy#5202: I feel out of place being self taught here lol. All of y'all went to school for gamedev
 Wokarol#0940: Show the design docs, brag about the degree/uni and for the future:
Create stuff to show in any way
 darlingS#1797: My Careers and Enterprise teacher always said it is best to have as much proof of your ideas no matter what field you are going into for your resume or portfolio
 TheGerkuman#0091: Good thing I do music now
 BadPiggy#5202: In that case, welcome to indie Dev XD
 TheGerkuman#0091: To be honest, most of the stuff I learnt at uni was pre-production design. Which is something that's more for bigger companies. Little indie devs tend to get multi-skilled people and not have a separate team who does that kinda thing
 Wokarol#0940: And if not, a design doc presented nicely works too
 Wokarol#0940: This will show that you know what you are doing and can design spaces and develop on ideas and proves that your skill is not only on paper
 BadPiggy#5202: This ?
Then yeah, what Wokarol said.
Design chops can be shown off in more ways than one
 darlingS#1797: My first guess for showing of dev stuff is concept sheets. Anything you write down, no matter what area it is, is proof of your work
 pogrammerX#1167: i have a own game engine
HAH UNITY AND UNREAL USERS
1084 FPS on a laptop go brrrrrrrr
 TheGerkuman#0091: Wokarol defined it pretty well
 Wokarol#0940: Grab something like Portal 2, Little Big Planet or whatever it is you have an like and create some levels
 BadPiggy#5202: No I mean, what do you mean by Dev work ? Lol
 Wokarol#0940: In that case I can recommend:
**Level editors**
As a way to show your skill and as a way to train
 TheGerkuman#0091: Yeah. How can one do that without relying on others to do their side of it?
 Wokarol#0940: Level design, game design and stuff?
 BadPiggy#5202: ^ same question
 Wokarol#0940: What dev work are we talking exactly?
 TheGerkuman#0091: Most game jam people aren't gonna ask to see design docs.
 darlingS#1797: That didn't work out the first time
 darlingS#1797: I found I had way too much for my portfolio when asked about it, so I ended up linking my YouTube channel which so far is only 3 Pokemon jazz covers
 TheGerkuman#0091: That's fairly easy for an artist or programmer. But for someone who does like, dev work?
 BadPiggy#5202: Or are they going ahead with season 2 ?
 pogrammerX#1167: yea
i feel like there wasnt a episode in YEARS
 BadPiggy#5202: Still waiting for season 1 finale :(
 CALSYTHE#6648: jmao
 pogrammerX#1167: lmao
 Wokarol#0940: > you end up not having a portfolio because nothing's good enough to show off n_n;
Which is a good motivation to make stuff you can talk about/show honestly
 TheGerkuman#0091: I never got the appeal of that hazbin/halloumi boss thing
 pogrammerX#1167: same
 BadPiggy#5202: HOLY CRAP
I DIDN'T NOTICE THIS BEFORE LOL
I love that show
 TheGerkuman#0091: Most team posts who want a portfolio will say 'please provide a link to your portfolio when you DM' or something like that.
To be honest, as much as I think portfolios are a good thing, when you're someone who's spent most of your uni/indie dev life putting out fires, you end up not having a portfolio because nothing's good enough to show off n_n;
 pogrammerX#1167:  nice helluva boss pfp
 pogrammerX#1167: okay thanks
 darlingS#1797: Oops
 BadPiggy#5202: Pretty sure they meant to say prize lol
 Wokarol#0940: ~~I mean... if you want to pay for it I can send my PayPal~~
 theChief#0001: I think it's on the itch page
 theChief#0001: don't quote me on that though lol
 theChief#0001: top 100 will be played by mark, top 20 (I think?) will be shown in a video 🙂
 BadPiggy#5202: The game you made and the thousands of games you'll get to play will be your unofficial prize
 darlingS#1797: It would be way less accessible if so
 BadPiggy#5202: No
 pogrammerX#1167: i dont care if no or yes, but will there be a price?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Ask away! 🙂
 pogrammerX#1167: i have a question about the gmtk 2022 game jam
 BadPiggy#5202: Aye but .....
I'm too lazy a pig to copy paste.
Or to dig through the description kek
 darlingS#1797: I've seen a few people just link their itch pages or personal websites in the description
 theChief#0001: actually yeah  a "portfolio" field would be really nice, and the ability to attach media to the post would be cool too?
 BadPiggy#5202: Just saw the team finder. Cool app tbh
Though maybe a suggestion, it would definitely be hard to police but what if people could provide a link to their portfolio/itch page etc. or maybe a gif or image or two of their last project ?
Would definitely help in knowing a person's skillset
 DrNukeLear#2414: Absolutely. As an ultra wide monitor user, very much so. Sometimes I get both though.
 BadPiggy#5202: Oh wait..... Nvmd
 BadPiggy#5202: What's the link for the team finder ? Not looking for a team but I definitely just want to take a look at how it is
 TheGerkuman#0091: I wonder if I should try and ping some more people with the teamfinder instead of putting my eggs into one basket.
 theChief#0001: but extend that out to ultrawide and it looks awful or you've got to do a bunch of extra work
Something like this for example looks way better than black bars and serves the same purpose
But yeah, some math I guess
 BadPiggy#5202: I do this only for GBjam / Nokia jam / Low Rez jam lol
 Wokarol#0940: Also, side note for retro games:
Black bars? Ewww
Painted bars? Hell yeah!
 theChief#0001: if you're on an ultrawide monitor, it's _so_ bad
 theChief#0001: it is a hack though, and I don't think black bars should be desirable for full res games
 theChief#0001: on start, set it to whatever Screen.size is
 theChief#0001: yep, you'd be able to change it through code though
 Wokarol#0940: And it would look wrong on 4k monitors as the image would be slightly pixelated
 Wokarol#0940: But then we circle back to it being a hack
 theChief#0001: you might even be able to use it and just set the reference resolution to 1920x1080? (or whatever resolution you want)
 Wokarol#0940: Oh, it does? Nice
 theChief#0001: ah yeah, that would make sense!
 theChief#0001: I often use 2D URP, yeah 😁
 GodOfPro#7302: also is 2d URP good for a jam or i won't even need it
 Wokarol#0940: The screen space is not gonna be mapped properly so the raycasting will fail. You could probably work around it but it would make working with graphic raycaster (event system) harder
 theChief#0001: me neither - but a few people I know have!
 DrNukeLear#2414: Really? I’ve had no issues.
 GodOfPro#7302: ok thanks
 theChief#0001: > I get it for pixel art games, where every pixel needs to be a certain size and everything is worked out by aspect ratio, but nothing else 😂
- me, 5 minutes ago 😉
 DrNukeLear#2414: Yeah 2021.3.4f1 only adds DOTS/ECS support.
 Wokarol#0940: I disagree, it works for retro games if done correctly (like Towerfall Ascension)
 theChief#0001: you can use whichever you like 🙂 I think 2021.3 is a little unstable at the minute, but it should be ok for the jam
 GodOfPro#7302: does the 2021.3.3f1 ok to use even tho it isn't the latest LTS
 Wokarol#0940: Wouldn't that mess up the mouse interaction of any kind?
 DrNukeLear#2414: I’ve never managed to get it to work
 theChief#0001: but they've got the device simulator now which is _incredible_
 theChief#0001: I don't think so 😅
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: that's ok I wasn't specifically saying it towards you, more just saying it before a specific type of conversation started
 BadPiggy#5202: F
 unityAccount#7810: Does the Unity Remote app still work?
 theChief#0001: yeah I make apps in Unity for my day job, this sort of thing is what I've had to deal with 8 hours a day for the past 7-8 years lol
 Wokarol#0940: Oh, of course. I was serious saying I will probably forget to sleep but I don't in any way encourage it.
It's just unhealthy and not worth it.
Sorry if it sounded like bragging or encouraging
 theChief#0001: but they default the UI mode to "overlay" which is objectively the correct one (that was a joke), even though it feels a little wonky to use 😂
 BadPiggy#5202: I learnt that the hard way back when I'd put all my games on mobile
Now I can't even do that
 BadPiggy#5202: Lol
 theChief#0001: I guess it's _slightly_ more complicated, and they want the easy option up front
 theChief#0001: tbh I have no idea why it isn't set to "scale with screen size" by default
 theChief#0001: ahhhh yeah
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: that's fair I just remember always setting a resolution but yeah it was the UI reference
 theChief#0001: I get it for pixel art games, where every pixel needs to be a certain size and everything is worked out by aspect ratio, but nothing else 😂
 theChief#0001: yeah makes sense xD I'm just very anti-black bars 😉
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: ahh that's what I was thinking of, no wonder i was confused lol
 TheGerkuman#0091: It *is* midday UK time. I doubt he sleeps in on a Tuesday XD
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: he does that sometimes
 unityAccount#7810: That seems cool
 BadPiggy#5202: Oh look, Mark is online
 TheGerkuman#0091: Ohhh, a scaler :)
 theChief#0001: what you do is set the canvas scaler to "scale with screen size", and set a reference resolution and what it tries to match
so you might say "I want my UI numbers to always be 0-1080 vertically"
 Tapu#9161: The pain all web developers know 😔
 Wokarol#0940: Nope, you gotta do it yourself. But you can use a bunch of UI components to handle that automatically
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: dealing with aspect ratios and display stuff is some of the tougher stuff of any engine honestly. godot display management still escapes me lmao
 BadPiggy#5202: Or atleast in 2018.3 it's not
Idk about later versions kek
 BadPiggy#5202: It's not in percentage
 TheGerkuman#0091: Ignore this post, I got confused
 theChief#0001: wait, no - not percentages
 theChief#0001: yep!
 theChief#0001: let your game render on the whole screen xD
 unityAccount#7810: Can you use something like percentages when it comes to UI? Like the pause button should be 10% from the left edge of the screen on every aspect ratio
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: gotch, like I said I haven't worked with unity fr a while
 theChief#0001: but black bars are bad
 BadPiggy#5202: I forgot what the option is called, but if you set the canvas to scale with screen size and just anchor stuff like the chief said, it works most of the time
 theChief#0001: a good way around it would be to force your _ui_ into a specific aspect ratio - that would be reasonable
 theChief#0001: no you don't, that's why the anchors exist 😛
 BadPiggy#5202: F
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yeah but then yoou have to recoade your UI to look diffeent for every possibility which is also terrrible
 theChief#0001: I get that it might be the "easier" option for making sure everything looks consistent, but it's frustrating UX 😛
 TheGerkuman#0091: Yeah, don't force aspect ratio. There's no real reason to.
 theChief#0001: forcing an aspect ratio is generally a pretty poor design choice tbh! It looks _awful_ on ultrawide monitors and 4:3 screens, which a lot of people do use
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: I’ve had terrible sleep for weeks, I’m glad it’s somewhat sorted out now for the jam
 TheGerkuman#0091: Game dev requires fresh brains
 BassWasTaken#7424: But that's just me getting on my horse about sleep which I will now quickly step off of again before I continue to rant for an hour.
 BassWasTaken#7424: Also good sleeping habits are whoefully undervalued anyway and a lack of proper sleep accounts for a huge portion of health problems and accidents today.
 theChief#0001: that's because they don't _want_ you to force an aspect ratio 😛
 theChief#0001: the best way to force an aspect ratio is:
- make a render texture that has your desired output resolution
- set your camera to output to that render texture
- add some overlay UI with a RawImage, with the texture set to that render texture
- add an "aspect ratio fitter" component, and set the aspect mode to "fit in parent"
- add an image component to your canvas and set the colour to be black 
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: so you have to set the resolution you want to work with and the manually tell unity how you want to handle different screen sizes? that seems like a nightmare
 theChief#0001: in the game, it changes the camera size
 theChief#0001: if you've got UI, you need to account for that using the rect transform tool and anchors!
 theChief#0001: it'll just change the output
 theChief#0001: the setting is there so you can try out different aspect ratios
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: weird... so what does it do if you change the size of the window? I haven't used unity in a long time
 bodzash#4904: 👏
 Tapu#9161: In a way it's possible to but would not suggest it for anything that's more complex than a jam game ( Since you'd need to run a web build and ship the user a browser)
 TheGerkuman#0091: Biggest issue is scope. AIM SMALL! Scope creep and/or an unrealistic initial scope kill projects dead.
 theChief#0001: It doesn't do that in a build 😂
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: wooooo 🥳
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I though that the whole point of setting a working resolution was that it automatically gave you black bars to keep your choice aspect ratio intact
 Jeker#3389: Hey, sorry this might be kind of off topic but...I GOT B2 ENGLISH DEGREE! WITH A 99/100
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Please no jokes about not sleeping/eating/etc during the jam. the games industry has a real problem with worker "crunch" and its not ok. This jam is mean to be a fun challenge, it is NOT meant to be training yourself to cope with bad work environments.
What you do with your own body is your choice, if you decided not to sleep etc then that is your choice, but we will not accept anyone bragging about it and we will not accept comment such as "if you rest then you're not dedicated enough". You might mean it as a joke but there are many people who actually believe it as well as it already being a bit issue in the industry and we don't want to facilitate that
 theChief#0001: That's right, yeah
 Mark Brown#6982: there's no way for Unity to actually apply black bars in the built version, right? I ended up plopping in a couple black rectangles on the UI layer to fix 16:10 issues in Platformer Toolkit
 theChief#0001: Like walrus said, you'll probably want to switch it over to something more common
 theChief#0001: That's a setting in your game view, it doesn't affect the built version ☺️ basically it means the game will display based on the size of the window in the editor, rather than putting black bars and locking it to your target aspect ratio
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: you most likely want 16:9 free aspect means it isn't set at and aspect ration and will be really weird to work with if you don't what you are doing
 GodOfPro#7302: what does unity free aspect do ? i don't know a lot about unity
 Wokarol#0940: I will either sleep too much or I will forget to sleep by accident
 Jonathor#1971: yea lol who goes outside anyways
 GodOfPro#7302: the test build works on itch nice
 GodOfPro#7302: the go outside part is the hardest part lol
 bodzash#4904: 10/10 advice, can recommend
 theChief#0001: Your brain requires these things, if you don't do them your game **will** suffer
 theChief#0001: Plan around getting _at least_ 6 hours sleep both nights, if not more! Also eat well, drink lots and _go outside_ 😉
 Clive Dev#0446: lol
 theChief#0001: Please don't do that 😂
 Jonathor#1971: Pretty tough to work 24/7 2 days straight sitting on your computer lol
 BadPiggy#5202: Yup
 TheGerkuman#0091: I think every project I've been part of has been a bit of a disaster. Usually not my contributions though. Game dev work's tough
 GodOfPro#7302: 177 seconds
 GodOfPro#7302: a empty project with just a square that moves with wasd is maxing my cpu lol for webgl
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: No worries, technically you could do it with a completely empty project but if you have something moving then you knows its working for sure
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: yeah, last jam i was doing a scramble to get my game up in webgl and due to some unity shenanigans, i couldn't and had to upload to downloadable. my game did well regardless but i can't imagine how well it would've done if i had it uploaded as a webgl thing
 Clive Dev#0446: would it be fine to submit an empty itch.io project then upload the builds and design the page when the jam is about to end?
 BassWasTaken#7424: It sounds simple but I had not considered you can test all that by uploading literally just a project with a moving block and that's brilliant, will definitely do that.
 GodOfPro#7302: also is it recommended to use 2D URP for a jam or it doesn't matter to use the 2D core
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Also please do remember that there will be no option to email Mark to fix things if you upload your game and the files don't work, or if you're "only 5 minutes late".
I can't stress enough how important it is to get your game in on time. Please make a project with a moving block, export it and upload it to itch so that you know how to do that and what files you need etc before the jam starts
 Tapu#9161: GMTK jam, the yearly stress test for itchio servers
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: yup
 Zoro5168#0115: Ikr
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: there is a 2 hour grace for uploading, you shouldn't need it. get your game in on time you do NOT want to be fighting 5000 other people also uploading games at the same time as you
 Zoro5168#0115: Binge create with code course
 unityAccount#7810: Oh, in that case that's fair. But generally, there's no need to stress about learning tons of stuff before the jam as you may end up exhausted and remembering nothing from all those tutorials😅
 Zoro5168#0115: Im bout to learn js html and css in 2 days
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i mean i've seen this person talk before and they're completely new to unity from what they said, so you know, maybe checking tutorials beforehand is a good idea, especially in a 2 day jam which itself is already a stressful environment to get something done as a complete beginner
 unityAccount#7810: I think the most learning happens during the jam😅
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: isn't there a 2 hour grace period after the deadline for actually uploading the game?
 Clive Dev#0446: Building to webgl in unity takes pretty long so if you want a webgl build, maybe start building, at least, 30 minutes before the submission period ends.
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Splitting objects is so satisfying
 GodOfPro#7302: i need to learn as much as i can before the jam lol
 GodOfPro#7302: yea def
 Yollie#2239: good luck! make sure to scope small though
 GodOfPro#7302: it is going to be my first game / jam so i hope i can finish it lol
 Yollie#2239: im kidding use it if you have a few hours left or something
 Yollie#2239: just dont use webgl if it doesnt work 👍
 theChief#0001: well this isn't entirely true 😉 if you use compute shaders (which would include VFX Graph) then you won't be able to do a web build. There are a couple of other things that aren't supported, too. Also, Unity's WebGL implementation is pretty crap, so it's very important to **__TEST EVERYTHING REALLY WELL__**
 Mark Brown#6982: I think Gzip is the one that *does* work
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: i don't know if 'brotli' works now or if you need to set it to 'disabled'
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: the big one is player settings -> publisher settings -> compression format. the default 'gzip does not work on itch'
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: probably best to like, download a tutorial sample game or something and tweak with stuff until you get it to work. it's not something you want to be banging your head against in the last hour of the jam
 GodOfPro#7302: interesting yes i use unity so what project settings i should use to work with itch ?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Hmm weird, it should work for the phone app. Ah well, as long as the back-up button works fine 👍
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: are you using unity? it should 'just work', though there are some things in the project settings that could trip you up. in particular the default compression settings don't work for an embedded game on itch
 TheGerkuman#0091: Mobile
 GodOfPro#7302: do i need additional code to support the web version or it will handle it it self ?
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: it is recommended though. you'll get a lot more eyes on it as a web game
 GodOfPro#7302: ah ok
 SlamBamActionman#7160: > You must produce a digital computer game, that runs on Windows - or web browsers supported by Windows. You can support additional platforms (such as Mac or mobile) if you like, but a Windows / browser build is necessary.
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: ok thanks
 theChief#0001: you don't _need_ to - I almost certainly won't be doing a WebGL build
 GodOfPro#7302: i need to build the game as WebGL for the jam right ?
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: there's a plugin for that everybody uses but i can't remember what it's called
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Are you using web Discord with Chrome? Or the standard client
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: I want to be able to destroy an object by having it explode out
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Anyone know how to split a mesh into parts in blender
 TheGerkuman#0091:  seems that the DM button isn't working for any of the posts on the team finder website. Says it can't find any user.
Obviously there's the backup ping thingy, but the FAQ said to let you know if any of it isn't working, so...
 manis#4282: xddd
 BadPiggy#5202: It's a test of anxiety more than anything else until then
 SquidGeneral10#4090: Nope, gets revealed when the jam starts 👀
 manis#4282: is it like LD where we vote??
 manis#4282: I ve read nothing about the possible themes
 SquidGeneral10#4090: Hihi! You looking forward to the jam? Any theme predictions?
 manis#4282: heyyyy 
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: lol i've left school this year
 Zoro5168#0115: School sucks
 Clive Dev#0446: epic :0
 Merus#7019: hello those who asked for it: we've made  into an announcements channel, so you can follow that channel in your own team or jam discords and get GMTK Jam announcements like the theme!
 darlingS#1797: But that's pretty neat
 darlingS#1797: Wouldn't expect it to make sense anyway
 tykenn#8548: We voted on a few ideas through discord and then set up a shared wiki with stuff for other people to reference, also there were some DMs going back and forth for more specific crossover ideas. It was pretty lax though and ultimately the continuity made little sense.
 darlingS#1797: How much did they have to reference? Only one other or like, all of them?
 theChief#0001: okay this is a pretty apt description 😂
 tykenn#8548: It was a pain to coordinate though
 DrNukeLear#2414: That sounds epic
 tykenn#8548: I once hosted a crossover game jam. We all had to reference each other's games in our own. It was a fun experiment
 darlingS#1797: Music alone would be a pain without like 70 different people
 darlingS#1797: That seems painful
 darlingS#1797: Actually that sounds like someone released a full version of Melee in 48 hours nvm
 darlingS#1797: Game jam smash bros
 BadPiggy#5202: Though it's more like comic con for jammers
 BadPiggy#5202: Hard to disagree tbh lol
 dardasaba#9759: Well said xD
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Well its 10.39 am here so like almost noon but like it's still morning and I just woke up cus I sleep long so it's morning yet also no cus I'm also not a morning person
 DrNukeLear#2414: In my house it’s not morning until the third cup of coffee. I am never a morning person.
But good morning.
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: g'morn
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Good morning everyone
 Stopa#6148: Sunday evening every jammer: "Mr. Mark, I don't feel so good..."
 PepperBoi#4544: But instead of dust it’s sleep deprivation
 tykenn#8548: So of course it ends in half of us getting thanos'd
 tykenn#8548: GMTK jam discord is like the crossover episode of game jam discords
 PepperBoi#4544: Yeah i did some but I had to miss a few
 manis#4282: i did them during school lol
 L3mmy♡#2307: Yeah, I picked up pixel art during lockdown and thought I might as well make it more useful than just pixels on my screen and make art for games
 PepperBoi#4544: Yeah I got into game dev cause of Covid so it was weird having school this year and not being able to do some of the yearly jams i did
 L3mmy♡#2307: It's nice to be back, I took a break because University and weekends were my only free days
 L3mmy♡#2307: I'm slowly unrusting
 PepperBoi#4544: Yeah I got burnt out after like 20 lol, it’s like riding a bike tho
 PepperBoi#4544: I can’t imagine having my first jam in a team
 L3mmy♡#2307: and then, there's me, 11 mini jams games, haven't jammed in basically a year
 PepperBoi#4544: Ooh cool
 L3mmy♡#2307: The hype in the team is real
 L3mmy♡#2307: We have a first jammer in our team
 RocketCow#5210: so are plenty of others.
 PepperBoi#4544: Like I’ve seen people from mini jam, gwj, ludum dare, devduck and probably more
 RocketCow#5210: no, I'm new as well
 manis#4282: Im the only one new....Not in game jams but in GameJam Discor servers LOL
 manis#4282: xDDD
 PepperBoi#4544: Yeah lol
 L3mmy♡#2307: I'm the only Jam Legen't there
 L3mmy♡#2307: Oh yeah, I think I seen you a bit around the Mini Jam Discord server
 PepperBoi#4544: It’s crazy that I see people from every game dev Discord I’m in here lol
 L3mmy♡#2307: Yeah, we have a discord server for us, my team, and it would be nice to have the most important info there directly so we don't have to check here
 manis#4282: Well, you see, me and my friends who participate in gamejams like this have a discord server to that we can talk and it would be nice to have each jam news posted there directly
 Brainz Code#7664: Thanks
 manis#4282: thanks for the link :-))
 manis#4282: yeah he said that you should try clicking the link mentioned in that channel
 Brainz Code#7664: for the jam
 Brainz Code#7664: I want to find a team
 L3mmy♡#2307: that's normal, you're meant to click the link
 manis#4282: i don't think it's a chat channel
 manis#4282: Yeah it really would but it's ok :-))
 Brainz Code#7664: I can't send a message in 
 L3mmy♡#2307: but a channel with info about the jam that we could follow would be great
 Merus#7019: okay, I'll run it up the chain and see what we come up with
 manis#4282: oh ok fine then :-))
 L3mmy♡#2307: I don't think non-patreons have access to those yeah
 Merus#7019: hmm, we may not have made those channels available to non-patrons...
 manis#4282: well, yes! It would be great! Although it's hard for me to find those 2 channels that you've just mentioned in this server
 Merus#7019: we have a couple of channels like that already,  and  . Would you like me to ask Mark to make jam announcements in there, so you can follow it in your own Discord?
 manis#4282: I mean...In other servers there is the "Follow" button which makes anouncments come to your own server directly
 Merus#7019: I'm not sure what you mean?
 manis#4282: hey! Is there any way to follow the jam channels when they are open?
 Phallo#3476: quick general hint on life that will also apply to the game jam... make sure you have adequate air circulation during the jam
study results from harvard

 RedTeapot#1960: There might be on 
 Jooj0ker#1972: Any game designer looking for team for gmtk game jam?
 RocketCow#5210: I've been meaning to wathc it as well
 CoffeeMan#2926: hello
 wren#0640: i am a big brennan fan so calamity has me intrigued but i havent gotten around to it
 RocketCow#5210: "short"
 RocketCow#5210: Though now we have Exandria unlimited, which is a short format
 RocketCow#5210: it is very long
 Selviam#7268: ive been wanting to watch the critical role series but its so loooooong
 RocketCow#5210: Matt has a knack for making any injure sound... utterly unpleasant
 RocketCow#5210: I was more worried about them trying to tone down the gore that is inherently present in matt's narration
 StormyMay#4100: im realizing that may sound bad to the uninitiated its not what it sounds like
 StormyMay#4100: homie literally allowed scanlan to piss on him
 RocketCow#5210: but they didn't
 StormyMay#4100: my favorite bit is npc matt mercer getting brutalized
 RocketCow#5210: I was afraid that they'd cut Matt's particular mix of humor and *utter brutality*
 RocketCow#5210: legend of vox  machina is delightful, though
 StormyMay#4100: I gotta highly recommend legend of vox machina tho
 RocketCow#5210: 2 is  more fun, because they got used to playing characters from the get-go
 StormyMay#4100: understandable its  ahuge undertaking
 wren#0640: i might watch the recent exu but i doubt ill ever watch 1 or 2
 StormyMay#4100: i have watched the entirety of 1 and 2 but im a hot sec behind on 3
 tykenn#8548: You can't just break down the maze. The walls are as sturdy as those bushes in pokemon
 RocketCow#5210: please don't remind me that I have like 40 4-hour episodes on season 2 alone left
 StormyMay#4100: I enjoy the joke that after the end of critical role campaign one percy and vex use a giant hedge maze to keep adventurers out
 BadPiggy#5202: Just break down the maze
 RocketCow#5210: The winchester mansion: The game
 tykenn#8548: This reminds me of something I'm adding to a game: there's a wanted criminal guilty of severe building code violations in a town that really takes it seriously, but nobody can arrest him because they can't find him in the massive maze he built in his yard.
 RocketCow#5210: my bad
 RedTeapot#1960: Oh yeah, you have some regulations to comply with but you're forced to place the explosives and dangerous stuff somewhere
 Lawn#1538:  please.
 BadPiggy#5202: Take me home
 Samarjan#1383: country roads...
 RocketCow#5210: my god, a city builder that is all about side-stepping regulations in creative ways.
 Tapu#9161: And a poop volcano
 RedTeapot#1960: Card-based city builder but a lot of cards you get are explosives and stuff
 RocketCow#5210: Mafia 7: argue with an Osha representative for 15 and a half hours
 BadPiggy#5202: Broforce
 Tapu#9161: Rule #6245: Have 2 tons of dynamite in every building
 RocketCow#5210: I want to make a game eventually that is all about rules-lawyering
 Selviam#7268: then the city falls apart bc the rules got changed to destructive ones
 Scolon#4218: I should sleep too, I need to setup a few things tomorrow
 BadPiggy#5202: No I meant literally re-write OSHA rules lol
 Samarjan#1383: were making our own jams with HARD HITting ideas like this
 Tapu#9161: Osha is you
 birdstone#3073: it's midnight for me gonna go to bed, goodnight
 BadPiggy#5202: Make a game where the player has to re-write the rules
 RocketCow#5210: I did *NOT* misspell it this time.
 RedTeapot#1960: Imma make a game where the player has to read it muahahaha
 wren#0640: if theres any evidence you havent read all pages of the official osha guidelines instant perma ban
 birdstone#3073: will prepare an instruction manual for my game
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Osha Compliant vs Osha Complaint
 RocketCow#5210: have fun reading 300 pages of osha regulations
 RocketCow#5210: this year's theme is "osha compliant"
 Samarjan#1383: actually i like this a idea a lot im writing this down on my idea notes lol
 birdstone#3073: "your game doesn't comply with worker health and safety"
 RocketCow#5210: every 75 feet
 Samarjan#1383: 😎
 Selviam#7268: and hard hats
 birdstone#3073: that's a very moxxie move
 RedTeapot#1960: Don't forget fire extinguishers
 SlamBamActionman#7160: banned
 BadPiggy#5202: F in chat for " out of control "
 Samarjan#1383: Skateboard racing with a STEPLADDER
 RocketCow#5210: NO UNSECURED PLATFORMS!
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Darn right!
 birdstone#3073: LOL
 wren#0640: NO unsafe scaffolding in your games
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Only allowing Safe For Work stuff
 SlamBamActionman#7160: All games must show OSHA-compliant situations
 RocketCow#5210: yeah, like I said, I'm not planning on stretching any taboos, just a personal annoyance.
 BadPiggy#5202: This
 birdstone#3073: just be safe and go for a general audience, something both a kid an adult would enjoy
 Samarjan#1383: ah right
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Just err on the side of caution when it comes to that stuff. Society is a bit stupid with what's taboo sure but them's them breaks
 birdstone#3073: this conversation made a weird turn
 wren#0640: all jam games bust adhere to the hays code
 RocketCow#5210: this.
 Tapu#9161: It's fine if it's a man's
 Samarjan#1383: MOST nipples are fine
 birdstone#3073: k wait hold on
 RocketCow#5210: Disclaimer: I will not do NSFW stuff, don't worry. I'm just annoyed by the fact that violence is fine, but a nipple isn't
 birdstone#3073: ^ as long as it's not like doom level violent it's fine
 StormyMay#4100: pg-13 if you will
 Scolon#4218: Fantasy Violence is fine
 RocketCow#5210: no I mean the american standard of NSFW
 birdstone#3073: i mean it's better to aim for something that world appeal to a general audience and not risk things
violence like traditional zelda games should be fine i think
 BadPiggy#5202: I'm not
 RocketCow#5210: ah yes, the *american*
 Scolon#4218: Questionable pixels lmao
 BadPiggy#5202: Basically, your jam entry can have a decent amount of violence in it as long as it's kinda tame
Anything else is not allowed
 RocketCow#5210: it isn't. I tagged my first itch project NSFW because of a few questionable pixels and I have done nothing but regret it ever since
 Scolon#4218: No lol, it's pretty self explanatory anyways
 Tapu#9161: No hard hat
 StormyMay#4100: I mean the super long ads are always skippable but being busy and getting really long ads is incredibly frustrating
 BadPiggy#5202: ***No***
 RocketCow#5210: hey  guys do you want to have an extended discussion about what is and is not safe for work? no? okay.
 birdstone#3073: funny physics are the best
 Tapu#9161: Use your nose on those ocassions 👃🏻
 birdstone#3073: what happened to the time where all ads could be skipped
 BadPiggy#5202: Yup
 Selviam#7268: or explosiuns anad destructioooon
 Tapu#9161: Everyone likes physics
 StormyMay#4100: do you know how many times I've had my hands full and been unable to skip a 30 minute ad
 birdstone#3073: goodnight
 JJfriends#3686: Gn peeps I'ma sleep (sorry again mods)
 StormyMay#4100: okay but ads longer than a couple minutes should not be a thing on youtube
 BadPiggy#5202: If you really can't come up with an idea for a game, a mechanic where you YEET something is always fun
 RedTeapot#1960: I believe getting banned from the Discord doesn't disqualify you from the jam (assuming your game is fine). It's not an advice though kek
 JJfriends#3686: Sowwy
 birdstone#3073: i remember getting a 15 second ad for a 7 second video
 Lawn#1538: 
 Lawn#1538: Follow the rules and it’ll be all gravy.
 StormyMay#4100: "mom vs dad" "I cant get past green!!11!!!!"
 Tapu#9161: Level 9000 mom vs level 7 dad
 JJfriends#3686: Please don't kick me from the jam been waiting for a year
 Scolon#4218: Just make a fun game dude
 birdstone#3073: "ONLY 2% OF THE WORLD POPULATION CAN FIND PURPLE"
 JJfriends#3686: It's a joke sorry mods my b
 StormyMay#4100: mkake a game where you can actually play the games you see in fake mobile game ads
 Selviam#7268: heeheh lmao
 Lawn#1538: I’ma mute you very soon.
 JJfriends#3686: Ok I'm getting banned
 BadPiggy#5202: Then you ask why no one teams up with you lol
 Scolon#4218: Bro?
 birdstone#3073: what
 birdstone#3073: oh no
 Samarjan#1383: yeah my bad
 Tapu#9161: Not safe for Waluigi?
 birdstone#3073: there's an urge to insert nafta into things
 BadPiggy#5202: Yo yo. Calm down with the expletives in chat lol
 StormyMay#4100: omg a game where you grow fucks to give
 StormyMay#4100: so no pokemon insurgence
 Samarjan#1383: why grow dicks when you can grow fricks
 Scolon#4218: Also don't make meme games in general, mark doesn't really like them
 BadPiggy#5202: You can maybe have a small amount of blood, but anything else will probably result in an instant disqualification lol
 StormyMay#4100: i was also poking fun at it typos can be so funny
 birdstone#3073: lol ik i was poking fun at it
 Scolon#4218: Oops lmao
 JJfriends#3686: Let's go dick growing gg ez
 StormyMay#4100: typos my beloved
 RedTeapot#1960: Oops
 birdstone#3073: "now" allowed?
 Scolon#4218: Yeah it's now allowed
 BadPiggy#5202: Also nsfw ain't allowed lol
 JJfriends#3686: Cookie clicker but u grow a dick
 StormyMay#4100: bro just make genital jousting 2
 RedTeapot#1960: NSFW is not allowed though
 BadPiggy#5202: Genital jousting
 StormyMay#4100: whats that party game where you literally just play as dicks
 Scolon#4218: Bro?
 JJfriends#3686: If the theme is something Abt growing I'ma make a dick growing simulator
 StormyMay#4100: just checking lmao
 BadPiggy#5202: Ah crud
 StormyMay#4100: did you mean to respond to me with that?
 StormyMay#4100: sometimes u gotta get out of your comfort zone
 Lawn#1538: Tell that to Team Cherry (they only had two programmers)
 JJfriends#3686: Also vcs will be awkward with 2 ppl
 Selviam#7268: i kinda cant since i wooont have a desk for a while
 JJfriends#3686: Cause 2 people feel too little that going solo feels better
 Selviam#7268: thats my plan so far ive been practicing coding *(even though i really need to figure out audio)*
 WorkingJoe#4433: 48h moment
 Scolon#4218: Why do you need 3+ people?
 Lawn#1538: Why do you need more?
 JJfriends#3686: If I can't find more than 2 ppl on my team I'm going solo
 Lawn#1538: Definitely get a mouse.
 BadPiggy#5202: In some ways, it may even be better lol
 Selviam#7268: it'd be cool if there was a game jam but there was only *one* game or maybe like two or three more depending on just how many people joined
 BadPiggy#5202: If all else, there's nothing wrong with going solo
 StormyMay#4100: someone get that boy some mouse
 Lawn#1538: It has been pretty quiet here since launch, it’ll pick up again in a few days.
 WorkingJoe#4433: Time to start a team made out of all 100 rejects and make a AAA game like monkeys on typewriters
 Selviam#7268: i can do that and its my favorite i just dont like drawing it with a trackpad
 Lawn#1538: There’s all sorts you can do in a jam.
 BadPiggy#5202: Don't feel bad about this tbh.
Most people prefer to jam with people that they've jammed with before, or if they've seen their work before
 WorkingJoe#4433: Le plant
 RedTeapot#1960: What about pixel art then?
 Lawn#1538: Team morale booster
 Lawn#1538: You can always contribute to the initial design, planning phase, and playtesting.
 Scolon#4218: It's ok you'll find a team
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Same!
 StormyMay#4100: we have a dedicated tester on our team
 JJfriends#3686: Tried the gmtk game jam finder. All big teams are full, all small teams are full, everyone rejects me, feels like I'm in 6th grade again
 StormyMay#4100: playtest!
 Selviam#7268: i'd possibly wanna join a team but the best thing i can do is graphics but i cant reaaaally draw much since my art tablet broke down
 WorkingJoe#4433: *Distant balalaika sounds*
 Samarjan#1383: find a pair of adidas and a bottle of vodka, youll fit right in!
 WorkingJoe#4433: I'd look for a team but I'd love to try the Unigine engine and there's like three (3) people using that, and two (2) of them only speak Russian
 StormyMay#4100: wow im literally spewing the same shit professors have told me about my portfolio I diodnt realize it applied so much to other disciplines
 RocketCow#5210: dm me, I'll have a look
 JJfriends#3686: YES YES YES FIFHUEDB
 RocketCow#5210: I was planning on going alone, but I could have a look at your prior work if you want?
 Samarjan#1383: sams udertal
 JJfriends#3686: Your probably right
 StormyMay#4100: its important not to hide your works in progress, especially later on when you do have quality work to show. ppl wanna see process
 Selviam#7268: daammnn looks like im gonna miss the first day bc of the same reason funnily enough
 WorkingJoe#4433: No way
 JJfriends#3686: I'm gonna tell them I made undertale
 wren#0640: yeah but also i miss her :(
 Lawn#1538: Then showcase what you’re working on. It doesn’t have to be complete.
 Selviam#7268: wait the jam starts friday?
 RocketCow#5210: I'm sure your gf will understand that you have a special event that will take *one* weekend, no?
 JJfriends#3686: Don't have any, trying to work on something good but long (nothing released)
 Lawn#1538: Have you showcased your new games?
 StormyMay#4100: show them what you want them to see first then, dont send them your whole page send your best work
 JJfriends#3686: Unity, c# been doing for year and half
 wren#0640: oh no my gf wants to go out on friday and i dont wanna be like "Hey i can't see you because of the Game Makers Toolkit gamejam" but also like. i wanna work on my jam game.
 JJfriends#3686: Like bruhhh I made them in 6 hours for a game jam I'm so much better now
 WorkingJoe#4433: Any teams working in unigine? Xd
 RocketCow#5210: Sh*te, what's your qualifications?
 JJfriends#3686: Dude they look at my really old games I made in a few hours and their like "nope not good enough"
 StormyMay#4100: took me a few tries to nab a team
 JJfriends#3686: Every dah
 RocketCow#5210: you did the team finder dance, I assume?
 StormyMay#4100: just gotta keep reaching out to ppl and be confident and friendly
 JJfriends#3686: I want to find a good team where I can actually stand a chance in. Like I'm not Abt to go 1v10
 JJfriends#3686: Dang why can't I find a team
 Samarjan#1383: hay i have one of those!
 RocketCow#5210: The real Toolkit was clinical depression
 Selviam#7268: Yeahh!
 StormyMay#4100: that was also the year of our lord 2020 which didnt help
 Samarjan#1383: so i guess its worth it
 Selviam#7268: the power of friendship!
 StormyMay#4100: we had a less than stellar teacher so nobody took the apah test in my class lmao
 Samarjan#1383: the best thing college gave me was my friends
 Selviam#7268: i mean i might as well take it and my parents would probably kill me if i didnt
 RocketCow#5210: oops all 8 am
 StormyMay#4100: I mean you could always take the class and not the ap test, I did that for about 3 classes
 RocketCow#5210: I had to take an art course in high school and I was better at drawing a human ear than I was at drawing *an orb*
 Samarjan#1383: source: went to college
 Selviam#7268: im excited but nervous bc im actually *not that good at history memorization hahaha* but a teacher i already like is gonna teach the course so theres that
 Samarjan#1383: whats college, if not designed to kill your love for what you are passionate in
 StormyMay#4100: my ah1 professor was much better about understanding the importance of context and significance over memorization of details
 RocketCow#5210: That's a big yike
 StormyMay#4100: that teacher was a professional art historian who refused to understand she was teaching fine artists not art historians and firmly believed you werent really learning the art if you didnt memorize the things
 RocketCow#5210: wow, that sounds like it's designed to kill your love of art.
 Selviam#7268: gosh at least my AP will look good for college 👍
 StormyMay#4100: college ah2 had to memorize about 45 specific pieces' artist, date, medium, and location per ~3 weeks and the tests weren't cumulative
 StormyMay#4100: college ah1 I just needed general period, meaning, and relevance  for about 20-25 pieces per week and a half for a 10 week course
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Uh uh, fuck that.
 RocketCow#5210: I took  one art class for my degree and asked "okay, how do I, who doesn't know artists beforehand, get into this"? Didn't get a response beyond "you'll just have to learn more about artists" and elected another course.
 Selviam#7268: that i do know i thought college history ap would be like 400 or something
 StormyMay#4100: college is way more lax than ap in general tbh
 StormyMay#4100: ap you have to memorize 200 pieces of notable art throughout literally the entirety of human history, their period, their artist, their relevance, their meaning, etc
 Selviam#7268: what-
 StormyMay#4100: ap art history is arguably harder than college art history
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: That's pretty badass, ngl. Lmao.
 Selviam#7268: now thats true multitasking also how is art history im about to take it as an AP
 RocketCow#5210: yeah, but that is, you know, your own fault. Unity will crash sometimes just because you went *a little too fast for its liking*
 Selviam#7268: the idle crash happened during the last game jam i was in thnank god it was a week long jam 🙏
 WorkingJoe#4433: Have had the same experience in ue4. One minor looping oversight and the program just hangs
 StormyMay#4100: this is reminding me of the art history class I had where I sat behind a guy building a game on his laptop in class twice  a week
 RocketCow#5210: I've never had the editor crash on idle, but I've had it crash on trivial tasks
 WorkingJoe#4433: It's not just unity though
 Lawn#1538: I’ve had the editor crash plenty of times while idle, but more often than not it’s while I’m running my game in editor.
 Selviam#7268: editor
 RocketCow#5210: as in the editor crashed or the game crashed?
 WorkingJoe#4433: Ctrl-s is the new enter
 Selviam#7268: idk if the game i made was just really buggy but i was just looking away from my computer for a second and found the crash bug reporter
 RocketCow#5210: it doesn't crash when you do *nothing.*
But god forbid you try anything *trivial*
 Selviam#7268: I remember when i first started using unity and didnt realize that the program would just crash randomly even if you arent doing anything with it
 RocketCow#5210: I'm too dysfunctional to be a partical
 Samarjan#1383: at this point im not sure if IM a particle or not
 RocketCow#5210: yeah, you have a point
 RocketCow#5210: every action shot needs particles
 RocketCow#5210: every close up of skin involves a few thousand hairs, which *are* in the end particles
 Samarjan#1383: a LOT a lot
 RocketCow#5210: there's certainly a lot  of them
 Samarjan#1383: i guess particles just run the vfx world at this point lol
 RocketCow#5210: I mean, in blender grass is just particle systems but in green
 Samarjan#1383: although it was for grass instead
 Samarjan#1383: funny you say that, it was similar for me as well
 RocketCow#5210: and blender just said "haha, no, f*ck this sh*t I'm out"
 RocketCow#5210: For me it was stacking a ton of particle systems on top of each other
 Phallo#3476: my first game jam i for some idiotic reason didnt think i needed to save unity and just needed to save my c# code... unity ended up crashing and i lost roughly 5 hours worth of work
 Samarjan#1383: i guess its just a curse working in a creative industry
 RocketCow#5210: That being said, I managed to do that once for blender as well.
 Pixstatic#3464: most people making vrc avatars are artists without lots of game experience and for some reason they can’t stand the thought of compromising small amounts of detail in unnoticeable places so as to halve the poly count
 RocketCow#5210: oof.
 Samarjan#1383: i once lost 30 mins of work even with increment saves because i had managed to do something obscure that corrupted all my save files from the moment i did that thing
 RocketCow#5210: I did a commission for a VRchat avatar once and I broke both my legs to optimize that one.
 Pixstatic#3464: I hate them lol no way in hell your supposed 3080 can handle that enough better than my gpu for it to actually be playable
 Phallo#3476: my model is for a vrchat avatar 😂
 RocketCow#5210: I see, that makes sense
 Phallo#3476: ya the final product is not going to be a million... but i want to keep as much detail as possible until the last moments as to potentially make the final product look just that much better
 RocketCow#5210: yeah but intercourse those people
 Pixstatic#3464: a million isn’t *too* bad (I’ve met people who have a cool 800,000 in their vrchat avatar’s fkin ear fluff tho so idk)
 RocketCow#5210: hating your software is par for the course, but *what* about maya do you hate?
 Samarjan#1383: As someone whos worked with Maya, i can tell you......
GOD i hate maya
 LorantC#5076: Isn’t it about setting on which processor to render? The gpu one was recommended but I don’t remember either the best config
 RocketCow#5210: I forgot the cooldown again, a million polys is *a lot*
 RocketCow#5210: I mean
 Phallo#3476: i have a blender model i have been working with that has roughly 1 million polygons and it crashes blender after almost every change i make to it 💔
 RocketCow#5210: I do wonder how other 3d programs handle big scenes. All I know is blender paralyzing my entire system back when I used to do VFX stuff.
 Pixstatic#3464: it sucks working in blender because in big blender scenes it freezes up for a good second or two whenever you save and that dramatically reduces my average fps
 Phallo#3476: come on... you know it is actually ctrl + s s s s s s s s s
 RocketCow#5210: that Sh- stuff used to crash at any opportunity
 Pixstatic#3464: stop this is hitting too deep
 RocketCow#5210: I got that habbit from Adobe's software, to be fair
 tykenn#8548: ctrl+s twice just in case you only imagined it the first time
 Pixstatic#3464: I hate working in any web-based application for exactly this reason
 LorantC#5076: This also happens with uhd intel processors(laptops)
 RocketCow#5210: my default is ctrl+s after *literally every action*
 Phallo#3476: as a programmer i always tell people to save a lot... but when using unity SAVE A LOT!!!
 Pixstatic#3464: I have tried, unity seems to dislike my obscure radeon card quite a bit and the UI rendering suffers the most.
 RocketCow#5210: I said it before: Unity will take your most challenging code and process it without a problem, but god forbid you ask it to *add a component to an object*. No, it will crash
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I thought you hated unity, but also *loved* unity.
 RocketCow#5210: how so? I'm curious now.
 Pixstatic#3464: lmao true. such a good tool but for a good tool it really sucks as a tool
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I got you wrong.
 theChief#0001: Ah restarting the editor usually stops that, or you can reset your window layout
 RocketCow#5210: don't get me wrong, I love unity, but I also *hate* unity
 Pixstatic#3464: I can’t even find my shader errors in the console because unity’s own GUI renderer is spitting errors everywhere
 Pixstatic#3464: I’ve been updating a bunch of shaders I wrote 2 years ago so I can use them during the jam and man I hate unity sometimes
 theChief#0001: I think an appropriate level of challenge would be making it so the arrow had more momentum - i.e. you can't change the direction quite so quickly
 RocketCow#5210: either is fair.
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: Yeah, but I feel like starting with blank slate. The project feels more a like prototype.
 RocketCow#5210: Occasionally digging up an old project and just iterating on it with what feels right can work
 RocketCow#5210: I mean, even if you don't come up with a plan
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: I might work on it again, but proper with planning of course.
 RocketCow#5210:  But yeah, play around with failure conditions and you have something good on your hands.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I would have been your daddy...
 RocketCow#5210: Just because he's your father it don't mean that he's your daddy
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: He's Mary Poppins, y'all!
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: I basically took inspiration from Guardians of the galaxy.
 RocketCow#5210: I do think there's a game in there, though
 RocketCow#5210: either that, or you could turn it into a kind of puzzle thing, where you have a limited *distance*. Or perhaps *limited turning angle*
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: Maybe I could've added some momentum or something. To make it fly like a paper airplane.
 RocketCow#5210: that's the one
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: You are talking Yondu. He's the guy who can do that arrow thing.
 RocketCow#5210: It gives me uh... guardians of the galaxy vibes. The guy with the mohawk and the arrow? Add some restriction to the base idea to make it appropriately challenging and *yes* I think there's a game to be had here.
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: I scrapped it.
 RocketCow#5210: And that deserves compensation.
 RocketCow#5210: if you ask me, asesprite is among the best software for pixelart available at the moment, and a lot of love went into it
 OrangoMango#0973: alright now I understand. Thanks
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: I just listened to the songs I composed for the 2020 GMTK Game Jam... Man, I forgot I made it a twist horror game with unfinished assets and wonky physics...
...
...
...
And didn't work since I shipped the Debug version instead of the final version... It's weird how I managed mid 2,000s in the rankings that year...
 RocketCow#5210: I mean, build it yourself, yes, try it. But if you like it, *really* consider giving them the 10 or 15 bucks or whatever it is
 Stef#4244: Then buy when you have money to support
 OrangoMango#0973: ah but the two versions are the same?
 RocketCow#5210: to support the people who make it?
 Stef#4244: You can have the github version for free
 OrangoMango#0973: Yes so why buy it?
 RocketCow#5210: no, because it's good software, relatively cheap and regularly updated.
 OrangoMango#0973: because there is the source code on GitHub and I don't understand
 NoFace#5304: where are the gdeveloper's?
 RocketCow#5210: yeah, but if you do pixelart regularly it's very worth it
 StormyMay#4100: libresprite was recommended to me as a free alternative
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: Could be used to do dream logs
 OrangoMango#0973: aseprite must be buyed right?
 RocketCow#5210: I mean, a lot of cyberpunk relies on *diving into the matrix* and that's cool as heck for the right people
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: Typing while dreaming.
 Phallo#3476: yes in theory... the real problem would be decoding them to something we could replay
 StormyMay#4100: just saying science fiction and cyberpunk would look way less cool if you just did brain typing
 RocketCow#5210: That's just hypotheticals. who knows.
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: Typing what you are thinking could lead to an accidental... ya what.
 Tapu#9161: Could you record dreams with a neuralink?
 RocketCow#5210: Mods, please note that I only swear when refering to myself.
 RocketCow#5210: you raise a fair point, and that means something coming from  a GITS nerd *sshole
 StormyMay#4100: yeah but what about the ✨ aesthetic✨
 Phallo#3476: this is my personal top selling point for neuralink... telling the brain to have force feedback in situations where there is none
 RocketCow#5210: imagine if physical keyboards stopped you from typing stupid things
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: Type something on accident
 RocketCow#5210: might as well have typing at the speed of thought at that point
 Tapu#9161: Just use brain to type
 StormyMay#4100: neuralink haptic feedback for holo keyboards?
 RedTeapot#1960: I believe there were some but they lack any tactile feedback. Same as tapping on a tablet basically
 Tapu#9161: The lack of feedback is the issue
 RocketCow#5210: not for anybody who goes beyond the "looking at the keyboard as you type" stage.
 Phallo#3476: i would say this is mostly true... but if you did it enough there would be a small chance of build up and corrosion due to the minerals in the water
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: I wonder if holographic keyboards will be thing.
 StormyMay#4100: i use a logitech silent mouse and keyboard because im a college student pc gamer that doesnt hate my roommates
 Tapu#9161: The capacitors could short circuit and die
 RocketCow#5210: for tightly packed electronics, yes. For keyboards? Usually not.
 RedTeapot#1960: Won't help with the greasy stuff. Needs detergent
 RocketCow#5210: electronics really don't care whether or not they were wet in the past, as long as you *let them dry*
 Tapu#9161: You'd need distilled water tho
 Phallo#3476: ya you can do that to all electronics if you do it correct
 RocketCow#5210: well, technically that's most keyboards
 Tapu#9161: Wouldn't it be nice if they made washable keyboards? Just dunk it in water and let it dry
 RocketCow#5210: I'm just very lazy.
 RocketCow#5210: it's not even hard to get the keycaps off
 RocketCow#5210: same
 Phallo#3476: my requirement is that it is only gross and not REALLY gross
 RocketCow#5210: the fun thing about the whole "aluminium slab with keys on top" style of keyboard is that you can just turn it around, slap it on the desk a few times, and it's *clean enough*
 RocketCow#5210: used those for the longest time. Invested some money when I had it into  both and they've been lasting. But it's nothing to be ashamed of.
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: Ngl, I never clean my keyboard.
 Tapu#9161: I use a 15$ keyboard mouse combo
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: Currently eye-ing on the womier k87 botanical theme. Looks like a nice acrylic keyboard.
 RocketCow#5210: that's very fair
 Phallo#3476: the big thing for me with mechanical keyboards is that im so used to typing on laptop style keyboards that i type drastically worse on a traditional keyboard and could not do the switch
 RocketCow#5210: I bought a mechanical keyboard from the local discounter for 70 bucks years ago, and it's still serving me well.
 Phallo#3476: this is the keyboard that i use and it is beautiful... was waiting for something like it for years
 RocketCow#5210: I don't know, thock never did it for me
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: Thock keyboards are totally satisfying, especially when coding.
 RocketCow#5210: can't wait for them to find my *expletive* geocities site
 Lawn#1538: People are still making content off the geocities archive.
 Amit.H#0786: i'm a writerman type
 Merus#7019: I'm a typewriter man
 Merus#7019: ka-thonk
 Scolon#4218: CLACK
 Phallo#3476: clack
 RocketCow#5210: clack
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: Keyboard sound preferences, thock or clack?
 Lawn#1538: I listened to a great podcast about geocities and the rag tag team of archivists who saved it.
 Lawn#1538: *Under construction*
 RocketCow#5210: oh god, geocities
 Amit.H#0786: I had a website once... *cries in Geocities*
 Merus#7019: I've had a message up on my site that I'll come back and pretty it up when I get time for abouuuuuut six years
 Lawn#1538: It depends who your website is targeted for.
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: I had a website... But then it became a pain to manage and no one visited it anyway... It was one of the google sites
 RocketCow#5210: bold assumption
 Tapu#9161: You
 RocketCow#5210: I've been meaning to make a website, but then again, who cares about me
 StormyMay#4100: :D
 StormyMay#4100: sure! I can give crit if you want
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I honestly think I just need to redo all of mine. Lol.
 StormyMay#4100: I've had watermarking and display optimizing on my to do list for so long
 StormyMay#4100: the eternal mood
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I need to update my website...
 RocketCow#5210: I feel like the *intent* of the rule is pretty clear. If you are challenging the rule, you might want to stop. If you feel like "this should be fine" but are questioning your judgement, you're probably fine.
Don't think I'll use it again though 
 RocketCow#5210: just ask yourself: Am I salvaging old material, or did I make this *for* the jam beforehand?
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Yes. Just as long as they're not made specifically for the jam. If it's art or music, you should note that when you submit your game.
 RocketCow#5210: *almost*
 StormyMay#4100: (disillusionment)
 RocketCow#5210: I find Cash's later disillusionenment (how do you spell this god-forsaken word?!) with the american ideals fascinating
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: You should hear One Piece at a Time is one of my faves from him!!
 RocketCow#5210: Though I find it funny when cash fans find the original NIN version of hurt and come to realize "wow, this sh*t's f*cked up"
 Karto#7782: Are we allowed to use assets we made before the jam started?
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Ring of Fire
 RocketCow#5210: I mean, I like "hurt" as much as the next guy
 RocketCow#5210: as an old man.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: ***BIG IRON ON HIS HIIIIIIIP!***
 RocketCow#5210: plus cash *died* 9 years ago
 StormyMay#4100: Boy named Sue is HILARIOUS
 StormyMay#4100: Okay but Johnny Cash is so funny and is actually meant to be ironic
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Ngl, Johnny Cash.
 RocketCow#5210: I can see it, my thought just went to bands locally that do similar things but *highly ironic*
 StormyMay#4100: Bo Burnham explained it best actually
 Selviam#7268: ohh yeah Lil Nas X did have a really good country song but i prefer montero
 StormyMay#4100: A lot of casual country music gets its fame from layman relatability
 RocketCow#5210: oooohkay that is
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: The only country I listen to is Lil Nas X || /j ||
 StormyMay#4100: Oh no its genuine
 Selviam#7268: the only country song i really like is that one that goes "I drove my keys into the side of his pretty little four wheel drive"
 RocketCow#5210: I have to ask though, his following, is that genuine, or is the whole thing more sarcastic?
 StormyMay#4100: That wouldn't be my top country music recommendation these days by far
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Me neither...
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Wait... Cult Ford is coming to Cheyenne?? Figured he would have a CULT following around here...
 RocketCow#5210: this certainly has a charme to it, yes
 StormyMay#4100: Dont get me wrong I still love colt ford
 StormyMay#4100: I very much did thank you, I was like 10
 RocketCow#5210: Some casual  sexism aside, I can't help but find this charming
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Did you at least have fun at the concert? Lol.
 RocketCow#5210: I genuinely love the cheese tho
 StormyMay#4100: That song came out at the peak of twilight movie fame too
 RocketCow#5210: Instant twilight reference, can't lose
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Chicken and Biscuits
 StormyMay#4100: I think that song encompasses the embarrassment perfectly
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: No clue here either...
 RocketCow#5210: never heard, let's give it a listen
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Oh, idk who that is.
 StormyMay#4100: No I think you'll probably judge out loud because it was Colt Ford,  country rapper
 RocketCow#5210: we will judge silently, though.
 Selviam#7268: was it justin?
 StormyMay#4100: I dont wanna say the first singer I saw live yall are gonna judge me
 RocketCow#5210: I feel like it's a very european thing though. These guys are Swiss. I'm german. It's like a faint shadow of germanic culture that sometimes creeps through.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: First band I saw was Paramore
 StormyMay#4100: My bad joke aside that makes a lot of sense
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: Same, Im on a potato 3000.
 RocketCow#5210: First band I ever saw live on my own, in fact
 Pixstatic#3464: I love it but I'm not rich enough
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Caninus
 RocketCow#5210: See, this is what I think off when I say folk metal: (not for everybody, shouting, heavy guitars, you know the drill)
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: 🤣
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: Anyone like building compooters?
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Same. Lol.
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: I guess there top hit was the song when the master didn't give them there treats...
 StormyMay#4100: SAME BRO
 RocketCow#5210: I HAVE to remember that cooldown is a thing. This does not support my usual chatting style.
 Lawn#1538: We’re supposed to screen them I guess
 Lawn#1538: Links are fine but embeds don’t work.
 RocketCow#5210: they won't embed, though
 Merus#7019: that guild didn't work out
 Merus#7019: the problem was, I was in a WoW guild where they were into metal and were talking about a band, and I joked "do they sound like a blocked toilet" and it turns out their favourite band was the same band
 RocketCow#5210: links are allowed yes
 StormyMay#4100: Are links allowed in this chat?
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: There was this metal band I used to listen to where the two lead singers were pitbull terriers.
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Someone forgot to flush...
 StormyMay#4100: I cant believe I'm educating a bunch of programmers on white trash washing machine
 RocketCow#5210: but yeah, I was brough up on a combination of weird folk stuff and weird rock/metal stuff.
 Merus#7019: I don't know a lot about metal but I remember I heard a metal song that sounded like a blocked toilet
 StormyMay#4100: That is redneck
 RocketCow#5210: oh lord
 StormyMay#4100: Think the most yeehaw think you've ever thunk
 StormyMay#4100: Excuse me I misrememvered the name its white trash washing machine
 RocketCow#5210: I'm european, redneck means *nothing* to me
 StormyMay#4100: I would argue that redneck washing machine is folk metal
 Selviam#7268: but i dont wanna do hard math in the first plaaace i just wanna make pretty graphics
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: A banjo plugged into a amplifier
 Pixstatic#3464: tungsten metal is my favourite
 RocketCow#5210: it's a very *wide* term these days
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Pirate Metal is dope
 Pixstatic#3464: I don't know what "folk metal" is but I feel like what I'm imagining is wrong
 StormyMay#4100: The closest I come to teaching my computer to do math is when my pen pressure suddenly doesn't exist and I have to troubleshoot
 RocketCow#5210: I remember when I was 10 I was obsessed with a within temptation record.
 tykenn#8548: But this way instead of doing the simple stuff lots of times, you just do the hard math once (until something inevitably breaks and you have to dig through your old code repeatedly over the next 60 years)
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: For a moment there I read M-E-T-H 🤣
 RocketCow#5210: My youth was DT, there was a lot pink floyd, there was a lot of *really weird folk metal*
 Pixstatic#3464: lucky
 Lawn#1538: I played Dream Theatre for my HSC.
 RocketCow#5210: to be fair, my mom isn#t exaclty... uh... pop oriented?
 Scolon#4218: Don't you just hate when you have to teach your computer how to do math
 Lawn#1538: Yeah that’s absolutely bizarre.
 Merus#7019: just the idea of Dream Theatre being mom music
 RocketCow#5210: we're talking images and words, *and nothing else*
 Pixstatic#3464: but the tedium is gone and replaced with confusion and fear
 Selviam#7268: but wont you need math to teach it math to make it do math for you
 StormyMay#4100: you expect me to have the patience to program
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: I always try to aim for that extra credit.
 Pixstatic#3464: it takes orders of magnitude more time but it's ""fun""
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: I got better at math because of programing
 RocketCow#5210: 28 isn't *that* young
 Pixstatic#3464: just program things to do the maths for you
 Selviam#7268: i remember when i was considered really good at math for my age then middle school hit 🥲
 StormyMay#4100: I dont have the patience for lineart you expect me to have the patience to math
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: ||Never gonna let you down||
 Merus#7019: > My mom used to listen to Dream Theater when I was young.
oh lord
 Pixstatic#3464: factually correct
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: Math is life, math is love.
 Lawn#1538: ~~Thin ice shadow.~~ lol nah, good.
 RocketCow#5210: when it comes to music I am pre-damaged. My mom used to listen to Dream Theater when I was young. I'm damaged for life.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: ||Never gonna give you up||
 StormyMay#4100: Cries in artist
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: I teenage, I teenage
 Pixstatic#3464: math is so good what are you talking abouutttt
 Merus#7019: the only music takes I want to hear right now are takes On Me by A-Ha
 StormyMay#4100: /j just so we're clear but math is terrible
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I adult, I adult
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: In defense, I agree
 Lawn#1538: I kid, I kid.
 RocketCow#5210: They didn't shame music, they had some takes
 StormyMay#4100: I DIDNT SHAME MUSIC
 Lawn#1538: The ultimate math.
 Pixstatic#3464: I'd say I'm a fan of all the "-phile"s but that really only works in context
 RocketCow#5210: IT'S *oops all math* here
 Lawn#1538: It’s deserved after you shamed music.
 StormyMay#4100: Oh no wait I didn't mean to help steer the conversation back to math
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: I've heard of him
 Merus#7019: if I wasn't busy I'd be seeking down the 'wat' video that's a 15 minute talk just about bizarre Javascript behaviour
 RocketCow#5210: I like numberphile
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: Anyone a fan of numberphile?
 RocketCow#5210: or 5/16, 5/16th, 5/16rth and 1/16th...
 Pixstatic#3464: something something javascript bad
 RocketCow#5210: Yeah, that highlights the point of time signatures often being interpretable in different forms. One of my favourites is 15/16th which can be read as 15/16th or 8/16th followed by 7/16th or the other way around.
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: I never divide, I multiply
 StormyMay#4100: When you put it like that I  actually remember a few pop culture songs that do that in specific areas to punctuate bars, living on a prayer is a good example
 Merus#7019: you break the laws of mathematics, you should expect prosecution with an ironclad proof
 tykenn#8548: Division by 10 only seems to come up because we use a decimal system, which makes 10 "round". If a different number was round, 10 would be far less useful
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: I there is a song (and it was featured in Fantasia 2000) that switches between 4/4 to 3/4 for every bar, essentially 7/4
 RocketCow#5210: What are you all about, divide by zero gives NaN, a perfectly usable data point.
 StormyMay#4100: Bro my precalc teacher was a stoner that let us cheat on tests and played guitar in class thats where my math education fell apart
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: Sentence would be undefined years prison.
 RocketCow#5210: There are, especially in prog stuff
 Selviam#7268: i have such a terrible understanding of math i wish i could get better at it during the schoolyear to help my scripting
 StormyMay#4100: I think there are a few prominent ×/16 songs iirc
 RocketCow#5210: divisible to an integer, that is, of course
 RocketCow#5210: if the denominator is divisible by the... other thing, it can be reduced to a *regular* time signature
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Maths > Math
 Merus#7019: someone here dividing by zero?
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: Math is fun, once you understand it.
 StormyMay#4100: So its a waltz!
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: ┬─┬ ノ( ゜-゜ノ)
 RocketCow#5210: no it isn't, I'm drunk, it is the same as 9/1 which is 3/4, my bad
 StormyMay#4100: Can't believe I wanted to do that shit professionally I hate math
 StormyMay#4100: Oh music, the most cursed of all the maths
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: Jail time
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 RocketCow#5210: 27/3 is the same as 8/1, which is functionally 4/4
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I only divide by 0
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: Divide by 10
 tykenn#8548: Division by two is great. Division by 3 can also be useful. I almost never find myself needing to divide things by five
 StormyMay#4100: I dont think I've ever seen a 7/4
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: What would 27/3 sound like?
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Anyone hear of 7/4?
 StormyMay#4100: Functionally yeah
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Band member, I do remember songs that had 5/8, but I couldn't name them since I am bad with names
 RocketCow#5210: well, that's 5/4 but same idea
 RocketCow#5210: uuhh mission impossible?
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: 
 RocketCow#5210: gone, reduced to atoms
 tykenn#8548: If only we didn't have ten fingers. Then maybe we wouldn't be stuck with a decimal system based around a number that can only be divided evenly once
 StormyMay#4100: I also seem to remember a song in 5/8 but no examples come to mind
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Ha yes, 7/8 the most interesting and cursed of the music signatures
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: *Where's the 4th measure?*
 RocketCow#5210: 9/8 followed by 7/8 is a close 2nd, a lovely unbalanced back and forth
 StormyMay#4100: 4/3 is a scam in the best way
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: 4/3 is pretty cool
 RocketCow#5210: yes all my musician friends hate my compositions
 StormyMay#4100: The only 7/8 song I remember singing is Chindia, it was a tough one
 RocketCow#5210: it has that slight lobsidedness that is just... *yes*
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: 70 is dam near vertical
 RocketCow#5210: it is my absolute favourite time signature
 StormyMay#4100: 7/8 is so fascinating to listen to and so difficult to sing in
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: Five has 4 letters.
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: It's half of 10, then multiplied by ten its 50 is half of 100, then if you multiply that by 10 then...
 RocketCow#5210: No, I find it interesting, not frustrating. When I write music my first instinct is to write in 7/8. That is why I would be interested in hearing your thoughts on it.
 StormyMay#4100: 420 is pretty high
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: 180 turns me the other way
 Selviam#7268: and 180 is pretty half
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: 360 is pretty round
 RocketCow#5210: it's almost-even in the sense that a lot of every-day numbers are divisble by it
 tykenn#8548: Didn't you basically say it's interesting because it is frustrating? Because it fights against our need to divide things
 Selviam#7268: thats it
 StormyMay#4100: Its not even but it IS round
 RocketCow#5210: imaginary numbers I totally get
 StormyMay#4100: Its like. When you're setting up a still life if you accidentally grab four objects and set them out you're gonna have a REALLY hard time making a compelling composition until you grab another object or put one away. Its really just the fact that humans are drawn to such trivial things as the number of objects in a purposefully composed image that I find so funny
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Several people are typing...
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: Imaginary numbers too
 RocketCow#5210: That's fascinating to me, because I think of odd numbers as the most interesting. Could you explain why it makes you feel that way?
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: Null, I like null.
 tykenn#8548: five is such a frustrating number
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: I split one object in to two I get half of five
 RocketCow#5210: What I don't understand is what is hilarious about systemic quirks?
 StormyMay#4100: So groups of 5 objects are interesting SOLELY because it can't be divided in half
 StormyMay#4100: We're taught to always group objects in odd numbers because the human brain likes to pair things, so having an object that can't be paired incites engagement in a composition
 RocketCow#5210: well, yeah. For all intends and purposes art is made for humans, so it makes sense that its analysis would center on what *human brains* do.
 StormyMay#4100: The entire basis of the rules of fine art composition are based around arbitrary things human brains do
 RocketCow#5210: obviously people 2500 years ago hadn't had it figured out, nor do we have it figured out today
 StormyMay#4100: Human logic is so hilarious
 RocketCow#5210: But that's how it works. You *suggest* a theory and the theory remains active until disproven. That's the basis of our system of knowledge.
 RocketCow#5210: it is very good analogy, yes
 Selviam#7268: it'd be kinda cool if humans evolved form chickens like in Ponyooo
 StormyMay#4100: I do still think its a good analogy for arguments over specifics though
 RocketCow#5210: Whether that's true really doesn't matter.
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: Anyone remember Klay World?
 RocketCow#5210: yeah, plato stated the theory of the featherless biped, diogenes threw the chicken, or so the story goes.
 StormyMay#4100: Yeah diogenes what a guy
 PropheticPotato42#5763: The smart ass was Diogenes
 tykenn#8548: The featherless chicken was Plato?
 RocketCow#5210: and Plato had some... uh... let's say questionable takes?
 StormyMay#4100: Couldn't remember the philosophers name so I used broader terms
 RocketCow#5210: and it wasn't "humans" it was Plato
 StormyMay#4100: Its a great analogy though
 PropheticPotato42#5763: Keep up the good work everyone
 RocketCow#5210: it was, to be fair, a *piss poor* definition.
 StormyMay#4100: I think that sums up this convo
 RocketCow#5210: I've been meaning to learn procedural animations and IK.
 StormyMay#4100: Remember when humans tried to classify humans as a featherless biped and some smart-ass philosopher plucked a chicken and called it a human
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: No excitement allowed here. Go to 
 Selviam#7268: i really wanna make a fun little spider game and use procedural animation for the spider (not for the jam of course learning procederal generations and implimenting it in 48 hours would kill me)
 RocketCow#5210: of course, that is the cross all sciences bear.
 StormyMay#4100: Tl;dr human classification is arbitrary and hilarious
 RocketCow#5210: Technically, yes, practically, no? It's one of those "definition by exclusion" problems, where you don't have a definition but can determine what *isn't* part of it.
 StormyMay#4100: Coincidentally, by THAT logic all physical paintings and drawings are 3 dimensional because they are ALSO 3d materials applied to microtextured surfaces in thin layers
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: Man, I hope no one deletes my file...
 StormyMay#4100: By that logic would 2d games be 3d because they're all light projections on micro textured surfaces (micro rgb light)
 RocketCow#5210: would you be surprised that the definition of dimensions is a *blood feud* in media studies?
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Its all just a simulation...
 RocketCow#5210: I would say that true 3d is represented on a 3 dimensional medium, but that might be too far.
 Selviam#7268: so would a true "3d game" just be VR but you can touch and feel your surroundings?
 Triggered#6897: What was it called again stereoscopic display something
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: When did this convo get dark
 RocketCow#5210: well that's the question, isn't it?
 StormyMay#4100: Hottest take: nothing is real. Existence is a mass hallucination
 Selviam#7268: wait what is true 3d? what makes it different from everyday 3d
 RocketCow#5210: might be impossible in any reasonable fidelity. Who knows.
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: 0D is the OG
 tykenn#8548: hotter take: numbers aren't real. They're just labels for stuff
 RocketCow#5210: I mean, I'm mostly approaching it from a technical level. VR is 2 2D images rendered at the same time. Do we *need* true 3d? I don't think so.
 StormyMay#4100: Hot take: digital imagery isn't real its all numbers
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: Hyped for 4d
 Triggered#6897: And then sold holograms
 tykenn#8548: We keep raising the bar for 3d. Next only holograms will be "true 3d"
 RocketCow#5210: "Is my vocabulary overly specific? No, it's the players who are wrong!"
 RocketCow#5210: point still stands, even later 3d engines would very much use billboards to save on resources
 RocketCow#5210: *yes, it wasn't technically true 3d I know*
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: RAY-CAST-ING... That's what the original Doom used
 RocketCow#5210: I never tried 2.5d, it was always either or.
 tykenn#8548: Then you have stuff like super paper mario that actually switches between 2d and 3d gameplay
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: My first attempt in 2.5d was in a jam. It didn't go so well.
 RocketCow#5210: yes, very much so. They were used a lot to save on resources in the early 3d days. See: doom's enemy and object sprites.
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: 2.5d shadow shader
 StormyMay#4100: I imagine it helps a lot with memory load and rendering time though
 RocketCow#5210: they're a surprising pain in the *** to set up
 StormyMay#4100: thats so cool
 RocketCow#5210: if you're interested in the technical term: Those are called "billboards". 2D images in 3D space that are pointed towards a camera.
 tykenn#8548: And then the rendered 2d goes back to 3d because the image appears on physical 3d  hardware. Only to then be flattened to 2d by our eyeballs, and then back to 3d when our brain does depth perception
 RocketCow#5210: 3DS is based on an age old visual trick. Same, ironically, goes for VR. It's all calculated in 2D in the end.
 Selviam#7268: I JUST got the pun in your name
 Candle King#1000: sure, then i wont make a post just yet
 StormyMay#4100: I'm really fascinated by how lots of effects in "fully" 3d games (I've noticed it a lot in genshin) are literally just 2d drawings that always face the player, giving the impression of 3 dimensionality
 AquaduckStudio#0780: awesome, i will definitely contact you if i dont hear back by tomorrow
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: 3DS and that's all I'll say
 Candle King#1000: well let me know! If I don't have a team id love to join you
 RocketCow#5210: I mean, in the end it's all 2d. Until we figure out true 3d displays
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: Or 3d graphics is just an illusion and its back to 2d.
 RocketCow#5210: those are technically still in 3d. Albeit poorly (on purpose of course)
 StormyMay#4100: With the x orientation overlapping 2d sprites
 Candle King#1000: gotcha!
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: I would say this, 2.5D is a game that has 3D graphics and models, but uses a 2D plain of movement consisting of X and Y giving it a 2D like feel
 AquaduckStudio#0780: im talking to someone but she said shes going to get back to me so 🤷‍♂️ I think I do?
 StormyMay#4100: OH so like how lots of minecraft is rendered, specifically with grass and flowers
 RocketCow#5210: in the more traditional definition of 2.5d, yes. The 2d part is artificial.
But the point has been made that 2d assets orientated in 3d could also be considered 2.5d. Therein lies the proverbial rabbit, buried.
 Candle King#1000: wanted to know if you still needed a composer
 Candle King#1000: yeah same XD
 AquaduckStudio#0780:  hey im having difficulty messaging you
 StormyMay#4100: Pokemon bw uses 3d modeled by and 2d character sprites all rendered to the same res
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: Hold on, isn't 2.5d just 3d altogether?
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: For 2D objects in a 3D environment
 RocketCow#5210: no, raycast refers to a very specific kind of pseudo-3d engine. It's a technical term.
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Isn't the correct term "Raycasted"?
 RocketCow#5210: not at all. The term is *very* undefined.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Baldy
 StormyMay#4100: Methinks I have brought up a cursed subject
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Original Doom or Wolfenstein 3D comes to my mind
 RocketCow#5210: baldi I consider to be more of a re-tread of early 3d shooters, like doom.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: 👴🏽
 StormyMay#4100: Several people are typing
 Selviam#7268: i always forget baldi is part 2d
 Scolon#4218: Man the jam is nearing so quickly
 StormyMay#4100: Stuff like baldi immediately comes to mind for 2d in 3d
 RocketCow#5210: I'm a god darned boomer in case you couldn't tell
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: Im making a 2.5d game as a passion project.
 RocketCow#5210: "recent" I say, like this isn't years and years ago
 RocketCow#5210: which, I guess, is also 2.5d? It's a more recent trend, I feel.
 StormyMay#4100: I actually have minimal exposure to the pokemon games I just happened to have watched a lets play of b
 Lawn#1538: Fighting games are often 2.5D, plenty of platformers out there too.
 tykenn#8548: Yet every time I read 2.5d I think 3d game with 2d assets
 RocketCow#5210: yeah, like most modern pokemon, baring the switch ones
 Scolon#4218: Yeah pokemon bw is 2.5d
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: I herd that the first two Klonoa games got a remake of recent, I would check those out for a example
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Yeah
 StormyMay#4100: So like. Pokemon bw?
 RocketCow#5210: The art is 3d, the gameplay is 2d.
 Scolon#4218: 2.5d is basically when 3d is pretending to be a 2d game. It's usually done so they don't have to reinvent things like lightning and shadows
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: A 2D game with **DEPTH**
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: Is 3d in 2d, 2.5d? Or the other way around?
 Selviam#7268: ill have to hold off on 3D till i get a stronger computer, even now my computer will lag even if i just open up a 3d project in unity and add a cube
 RocketCow#5210: most animation software allows you to use functions to modify what happens between your keyframes. So instead of just a linear move from one to another, you can add some noise to make it more natural. Or add a sine function to an axis or two to add some natural looking sway in periods where nothing is moving. Saves a grand amount of time and can save your skin if you're not a crack at animating. Highly recommend looking into it for the software of you choose/are forced to use 🙂
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: It's a 2D game using 3D assets, essentially.
 StormyMay#4100: What exactly is 2.5? Like mid gen pokemon games?
 Scolon#4218: I always go 2D, don't really want to experiment with 3D until I've mastered the art of 2D. Even then I just love 2D way more
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Exactly...
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: Is 3d in 2d 2.5d as much as 2d in 3d being 2.5d?
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: 2D... It's just easier...
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I'm doing 3D.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: You doing 2D or 3D for this jam?
 Scolon#4218: I have solved way too many problems on complete accident
 StormyMay#4100: I think I may possibly remember what a sine function looks like maybe
 StormyMay#4100: I know what those words mean separately
 RocketCow#5210: Slap some noise, or a sine function on something, it'll make it *pop* even if you have no idea what you#re doing.
 RocketCow#5210: I mean, modern animation has the advantage of interpolation modes and function driven animation. I could not *live* without animation modifiers in blender, or whatever they're called.
 StormyMay#4100: I love seeing big artists do a dtiys and seeing 3d models of the art start popping up
 Scolon#4218: rip
 StormyMay#4100: I have a lot of respect for the people who take 2d and model ot in 3d, its a really unique skill if you ask me
 StormyMay#4100: Me, someone who hates animation, being forced to take an animated illustration class this fall,
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I have yet to try 3D animations. I did a tiny bit of 2D animation. But, aside from UI elements, I don't really do 2D.
 RocketCow#5210: I mean, that is a given. You are better at certain things than others. I'm not a great animator so I work around that in code a lot.
 StormyMay#4100: I only have the patience for simple animations
 StormyMay#4100: I feel like it could be meditative for me but I won't know until I've tried. I know I don't have the patience for animating but I also know rigging brings a lot to a team, especially smaller ones
 Scolon#4218: Heh when you're working solo that's kind of a requirement...
Well you can find ways to workaround your weaknesses and play to your strengths. Like you may be really good at programming but bad at art, so you create a simple artstyle that uses a lot of procedural animation for your game's artstyle
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Everything... I just do that... Why? Because I'm am absolutely nuts!
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Of the three 3D artists on my team, only one of them is a proper animator. I don't wanna overwork them, but it's gonna be neat to see a game of ours finally have more life to it.
 RocketCow#5210: It's soooo tedious. I know how to do it in theory, I *just don't have the patience*
 Jemmeh#7117: yeah you're looking at 10000000000x Developer 😤
 StormyMay#4100: I'm tryna learn to rig because apparently people drool for people who rig
 RocketCow#5210: at the very least proficiency with the general concepts accelerate your workflow
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I also am trying to become a better 3D artist, as I feel it would improve my level designs.
 RocketCow#5210: I'm a jack of many trades, I can do a lot of things to a decent level.
 RocketCow#5210: very good point
 Scolon#4218: I mean yeah you have people who have never released a game and just make assets
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: ~~I'M A PROFESHNAL IDIOT!!~~
 RocketCow#5210: Then again, in our modern times, what is a professional game dev? Some people have never finished a game and can live off of dev-related activities, like running a youtube channel? Are they professional devs? Are they professional content creators? who gives a darn.
 StormyMay#4100: Amateur and student usually referring to someone who intends to become a professional
 StormyMay#4100: I cant speak about how devs classify professionals, but in the artist world I think everyone agrees its just someone who makes money primarily from their  art. The range generally goes from enthusiast, hobbyist, amateur, student, professional
 Scolon#4218: Most skill level titles are self-proclaimed anyways so like
 RocketCow#5210: but I share the view of "makes money" or "makes a living off of"
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: That's All I can say
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Freelance
 RocketCow#5210: the definition of "professional" is a hot topic, has been since the term cropped up.
 Scolon#4218: iirc professional just means they make money doing game dev, though in some cases people use it to refer to skill level
 StormyMay#4100: I did a painting of Vanya from umbrella academy absolutely slaying
 StormyMay#4100: Conversely one of my last assignments was to create a game cover for a piece of media that did not have a game associated with its IP
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: GMTK is a good first jam, I did 2020 first too.  This is my fifth one too
 RocketCow#5210: The name of the jam was "A game by its cover"
 StormyMay#4100: Wait that sounds like such a cool premise though
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Yes.
 GoodUser#8929: If I'm an amateur game dev, is it OK to reach out to professionals on the team finder?
 Fraserfatt#1021: only ever done one game jam and I got suuuuuper burned out trying to fit things together 😭
 Scolon#4218: oh ok lol
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Anyone else participating in the Decade Jam?
 RocketCow#5210: it was a jam about taking a cover for a fictional retro game and turn it into a game, and after idea 1 failed I couldn't be bothered to contact another artist to ask for permission, as were the rules
 Scolon#4218: 30 day one...? was it the game off?
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: 7 day jams are good for that. I host a 5 day jam occasionally.
 StormyMay#4100: I definitely wanna see how this goes first, but I may try joining some longer term ones during the school year so I actually have time to work between assignments
 RocketCow#5210: granted, mostly because my idea was sh*te
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Jams are for everyone!
My first one was GMTK 2020! This is now my 6th jam!
 RocketCow#5210: I've joined one jam on my own before, but it was a 30 day one and I didn't get past day 3
 StormyMay#4100: Tbh I've known about game jams for a good few years now but it never occurred to me to try and join one until I got the server ping. I guess I just subconsciously thought jams were for devs only, not artists
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Welcome to the Game Jam-sphere!
 StormyMay#4100: It'll be good for my portfolio and internship applications too
 StormyMay#4100: First game jam! Got a notification about it on Ethan Beckers server and said screw it im taking a chance
 StormyMay#4100: So this is an opportunity to learn about applying my skills in a real situation
 RocketCow#5210: Pretty much same, though I've participated in 2 jams before as a team member, but never interacted with the community.
 StormyMay#4100: I'm studying concept art for video games but you have to be able to juggle a few skills to work as an artist on smaller game teams
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: First team?
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Ah, gotcha. I just got my team set up on everything (GitHub, Trello, Google Doc, Unity) over the weekend. My next day off isn't until the Jam day. So, we might have to wing a few things. I'm not worried, tho. I'm confident everyone on my team knows what they're doing.
 StormyMay#4100: I'm using this game jam as an introduction to the indie game world tbh
 RocketCow#5210: That seems like an interesting pairing of skills. Looking forward to see the result
 StormyMay#4100: It'll depend on the idea we settle on for how we tackle it in practice though
 StormyMay#4100: They're a pixel master and I'm a digital painter that can do passable pixel
 Jemmeh#7117: Oooh 2 artists that'll be cool to see what style it is in the end
 Ahsanulir1#0428: Ready For Game Jam GMTK 2022?
 StormyMay#4100: I've been doing some tests to see about blending art styles to improve work speed between myself and the other artist
 Jemmeh#7117: I don't want to have to cook this weekend lol
 Jemmeh#7117: yeah we got our github ready and I've been doing meal prep
 Fraserfatt#1021: github preeep
 StormyMay#4100: Trying to stay on top of individual proficiency and who needs to be in charge of what
 StormyMay#4100: Team management and file sharing site, github prep (which frankly is Greek to me but this is my first jam and I'm learning)
 RocketCow#5210: I don't have experience in management for games, but I have directed short films before, and boy, a crew of say 15 is a full time job.
 RocketCow#5210: very reasonable
 StormyMay#4100: Our team is 6 and we're already prepping for organization difficulties lol
 RocketCow#5210: I mean, you have a team of 10. Difficult to organize, but doable. But a full stacked AAA studio? Yeah, no, I doubt.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I host my own game jams and invite other people to participate in it. Is that kinda the same?
 StormyMay#4100: We're visual problem solvers trying to work with functional problem solvers to make something playable and amazing
 StormyMay#4100: Here's the thing, art students know story front to back but struggle with game mechanics because they don't know anything about developing them
 StormyMay#4100: Second fun fact! Did you know Horizon: Zero Dawn was pitched at an open call for employee pitches at guerrilla games
 RocketCow#5210: but are they good? I learned pretty quickly to abandon the more lofty dreams and became, I believe, pretty decent at coming up with ideas that are realizable
 Lawn#1538: I’d watch this show.
 StormyMay#4100: Bro you want a game idea talk to an art student almost every one has a game pitch thats been their passion project
 RocketCow#5210: oh yeah, a lot of studios have jams of their own, they know how to do those. But getting like... 100 people to make something over 2 days seems pretty much impossible.
 Lawn#1538: I think individual or small team AAA devs would absolutely slay, but an entire studio does seem cumbersome
 StormyMay#4100: It would take two days to find a pitch they think has potential
 Fraserfatt#1021: it would take two days to get through all the preliminary meetings
 RocketCow#5210: probably wouldn't have anything that compiles
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: We could prove why Indie is better
 StormyMay#4100: I truly believe if they tried to follow AAA formula for a game jam they wouldn't have a functional demo at the end
 Lawn#1538: But like, it’s not an advantage with ratings.
 tykenn#8548: It reminds me of one of my software engineering classes where one of our assignments was for the entire class to collectively write a single design document
 wren#0640: yeah thats true
 Lawn#1538: There are plenty of professional devs in the jam afaik
 StormyMay#4100: There's a lot of preliminary work that goes into AAA
 RocketCow#5210: I stand by my opinion that a AAA studio wouldn't produce Sh*t all in 2 days
 wren#0640: if a AAA studio signed up for the jam could we do literally anything to stop them
 Tapu#9161: Lmao
 RocketCow#5210: Or a game about a child raised by the ocean. A sea son.
 StormyMay#4100: Coordinating that many people thru a 48 hr project seems like a nightmare
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: 🤣
 Tapu#9161: Or a sports management
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: One of these days, I'm gonna assemble a 100 person team and we're gonna make an RPG for a GMTK Game Jam.
Mark ~~Brown~~ my words!
 RocketCow#5210: or something about TV seasons. Maybe a management game?
 RocketCow#5210: season based seasoning.
 RocketCow#5210: or... a cooking game. Seasoning
 Tapu#9161: ~~or I could steal people's ideas from ludum dare with theme "sacrifices must be made"~~
 tykenn#8548: I once made a sleepwalking sim with automated walking
 RocketCow#5210: you could also do something like "every choice you make advances the season" and make it a game about (not) wasting your life
 Tapu#9161: That sounds fun
 RocketCow#5210: or shepherding a sleepwalker
 wren#0640: you have to direct a sleepwalker around a level without letting them get themselves killed
 Lawn#1538: ~~I had a dream you made an MMORPG~~ you could literally do anything.
 wren#0640: or sleepwalking
 RocketCow#5210: dreams are a very wide field, but maybe something about lucid dreaming and making your character realize they're in a dream?
 Tapu#9161: Specially with changing the leaves of the tree
> Like ideas based off of dreams?
The themes are Sacrifice, Dreams, Seasons 
 tykenn#8548: farming sim, but seasons change across space instead of just time
 StormyMay#4100: Puzzle game where changing seasons helps you solve the puzzles
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Like ideas based off of dreams?
 Tapu#9161: O.o sounds nice
 RocketCow#5210: Adventure game, you change seasons on button press
 StormyMay#4100: As a native southerner its very interesting to me how relatable he has managed to be without actually living the lifestyle himself
 Tapu#9161: Guys share ideas for game relayed to dreams or seasons ( got in a small community game jam)
 RocketCow#5210: that makes a lot of sense
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I think so too. Lol.
 StormyMay#4100: Fun fact! Did you know Larry the Cable guy is not actually southern at all and developed the "cable guy" redneck stage persona while in college
 lilburlap#8480: You can always count on a larry
 Clive Dev#0446: maybe they meant garry from spongebob but idk
 wren#0640: same actually
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: I named the Coffee Cup that I drink my tea from Larry
 Tapu#9161: It was my first game jam
 wren#0640: ayyy
 StormyMay#4100: Git er dun
 Tapu#9161: Yes 2021.1
 RocketCow#5210: Consume prilozec
 wren#0640: oh shit i vaguely remember you i think? did you do the brackeys jam last year?
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Larry the Lobster.
 Lawn#1538: I’ll let that one slide cause age.
 Tapu#9161: Larry the cable guy
 lilburlap#8480: Cucumber obviously
 Lawn#1538: Larry David
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: Larry the snail?
 wren#0640: i also *might* ask my friend to make music? they made music for my last submitted jam game but idk they burn themselves out on music creation a lot and im not gonna pressure them to make something if they arent in the right mindset
 RocketCow#5210: good old larry, can always count on him
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: My Team:
Me
Me
Me
Me
Myself
I
...
And Larry
 lilburlap#8480: ^
 wren#0640: i like going solo but posting updates in a discord i have with friends for extra input
 Clive Dev#0446: Woah, do you have any tips for managing a team? For this jam, I assembled a team of 4 people
 Scolon#4218: Maybe next year I'll try a team
 lilburlap#8480: If a jam is like 2 months long and you can join whenever then you can go alone
 null_ham#2050: crack
 RocketCow#5210: Jesus christus, how do you manage that?
 lilburlap#8480: Yeah the shorter ones are fun because of the community mostly to me
 Scolon#4218: 2 day jams are the best for me
 Clive Dev#0446: in a 2 day game jam? nah, I don't think so
 RocketCow#5210: It seems they also made some changes to the structure, so characters like Weiss are a bit less of an unexcusable ***** now
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: Well, it's always fun alone. Right?
 Clive Dev#0446: ohh, sorry I wasn't able to 😔, was working on another project.
 lilburlap#8480: Well jamming isn't fun without friends and the only people who'd remember me was when I was being an annoying just-got-old-enough-to-use-discord user
The Interstellar Game Jam.
 Clive Dev#0446: erm I don't know what that is 😓
 lilburlap#8480: I need to do more jams just so I can have these moments with more people
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Did you participate in IGJ2 too?
 Clive Dev#0446: Hello Scolon
 Clive Dev#0446: getting ready to jam
 wren#0640: the song from the red trailer>>>>>>
 wren#0640: man the soundtrack was good actually why would they change that
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: RWBY Chibi was... a thing.
 RocketCow#5210: yeah, but it also seems like they dumped the original soundtrack for something *much more generic*
 wren#0640: sounds interesting actually because the originals art was.. less than great
 lilburlap#8480: Also the callbacks in rvb were fun and I giggled with the tension from that
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I think so. Season 1 was the best, imo.
 RocketCow#5210: I think they rebooted it recently? As more traditional 2d animation or sometthing?
 wren#0640: i dropped it midway through season 1 and havent looked back
 wren#0640: is rwby still going?
 RocketCow#5210: oh monty... RWBY could have been good.
 wren#0640: monty oum was a legend
 lilburlap#8480: I remember monty oums fight scenes the one where ||Wash was on the car|| was great
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Not to mention, ***when Monty Oum joined the team!***
 wren#0640: i should redownload halo mcc i havent played it in forever
 lilburlap#8480: wait rvb
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: It really picks up when they introduce AI and the Freelancers.
 RocketCow#5210: how did they make 14 seasons out of that
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: It ends when... it ends.
 The Sapphire Dragon#9748: Hello
 RocketCow#5210: *season what now*
 wren#0640: its still going last i checked
 The Ashe Man#8981: Never finished it so I ain’t got a clue
 RocketCow#5210: I haven't watched RvB in forever. I heard it went... uh... places
 The Ashe Man#8981: 😳
 The Ashe Man#8981: Sarg best character
 RocketCow#5210: "What? No. I mean, here in this canyon."
 Lawn#1538: Just floating on a rock in an endless void.
 RocketCow#5210: *why are we still here*
 Scolon#4218: Hello Clive Dev
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: What are *you* doing here?
 RocketCow#5210: An act of true honor
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: ( I was waiting for your cooldown to finish before I posted the frog. Lol. )
 Lawn#1538: It’d be better than the other game I won’t mention that’ll inevitably be made at least a hundred times.
 RocketCow#5210: (guess who forgot about slow mode)
 Clive Dev#0446: hello
 RocketCow#5210: and it is t-bagging
 RocketCow#5210: There is only one mechanic
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: *[ Makes game about t bagging for GMTK Game Jam 2022 ]*
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Keep the t bag tracker in that mode for the stats too.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Which is why I think having all of that toxicity focused into one mode could help alleviate the toxicity from the other modes, in theory.
 Lawn#1538: Even though it’s mostly unavoidable.
 Lawn#1538: A problem they probably want to avoid.
 Lawn#1538: Keeping that feature in the game kind of invites toxic player behaviour into the game imo.
 Lawn#1538: OnFaceCollisionEnter
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I wanna see the code that detects t bagging. Lol.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: That's a fun mode that I haven't really seen any other game do. Except CoD, who they copied it off of. But, not the t bagging.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: And kept T bag confirmed, too.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: They should've kept it for T bag confirmed, at least.
 Lawn#1538: ~~Probably~~ Definitley a good thing.
 Lawn#1538: “Ball”
 Lawn#1538: Splitgate was great fun. They took away the modes my friends and I were into when they started season 1 though.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: One of the devs on my team was playing videogames yesterday!
 Lawn#1538: Find me a game dev that *plays* video games, and you’ve found yourself a liar.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I'll just jump into a couple games of Fortnite, Spligate or put a little time in Hades. But, not much else lately.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I'll have to try it out sometime. I see people playing together sometimes and I'd want to join them but also, nah.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Re: Your Brains
Heya Tom, it's Bob. From the office down the hall...
 centslordm#6170: ok
 Lawn#1538: A bit slow at times but very wholesome.
 Lawn#1538: Re: Stardew. It’s a great game if those types of games are your schtick.
 Lawn#1538: Nipping that one in the bud.
 Lawn#1538: Oh lord. Let’s not become WSB.
 Scolon#4218: 🐵
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: HOLD. CONCERNED APES TOGETHER STRONG.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Lol.
 Merus#7019: the exchange rate is terrible, though
 Lawn#1538: ~~Deposits Stardew bucks directly into your IRL bank account~~ it’s a surprise
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: What does it do?
 Lawn#1538: Fun Easter egg, click the ConcernedApe logo on startup.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Blood, Sweat and Pixels is a great read, if you haven't read it already.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I had to flip back into my book. I don't think I saw him referred to as Concerned Ape.
 Lawn#1538: The indie lotto winner.
 aiursrage2k#2480: 🐸
 Lawn#1538: The man, the myth, the legend.
 Lawn#1538: Ya
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Eric Barone?
 Lawn#1538: Stardew’s creator.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Who is concerned Ape?
 Lawn#1538: It looks like they exported Stardew, then moved a few pixels around.
 Lawn#1538: You weren’t kidding with the art.
 Selviam#7268: Oh yeah i probably shouldve been more clear on the farming part when i said it lmao
 Lawn#1538: Not that I’m against that, but it didn’t fit the vibe in Stardew so it was axed by Concerned Ape
 Lawn#1538: Ahh sweet, I’m glad they didn’t introduce a meat industry.
 Selviam#7268: they expanded upon them to make a really cool zoo game
 Lawn#1538: What have they done to the animals
 Selviam#7268: yea thats true and it looked like it had a lot of content especially for players who wanted more from raising animals
 Lawn#1538: It’ll be split among the Stardew loyalists, there are plenty itching for new Stardew vibes. Particularly those who can’t mod it.
 Selviam#7268: and the game had lovely graphics too and a great idea but its kinda doomed to flop now
 Selviam#7268: yea im just surprised to see it as an IGN video
 Lawn#1538: Some are unashamed clones though, at least make an original map.
 Lawn#1538: Stardew clones are a dime a dozen (which is a clone itself)
 Selviam#7268: Has anyone else heard of the game super zoo story? I just saw a video advertising it on IGN but im very confused the description says its an indie game, but the game is undeniably ripping from stardew valley to the point that the maps look exactly the same
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Yeah, the slang is gonna be weird to get used to. I'm gonna take everything literally.
 Lawn#1538: I think it’s in the phrasing, and slang.
 Alchemical_Moon#8853: I'm not sure how different they are other than a few words I've learned
 Lawn#1538: Quite different apparently.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Idk how well im gonna do in Spain with that.
 Alchemical_Moon#8853: Lmfao, I'm learning Spain Spanish which is different from Mexico Spanish
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I know Caribbean Spanish. More specifically Dominican.
 Lawn#1538: They are *really* similar. I’ve learned a little Spanish, but Argentinian Spanish which is apparently the Australian version of Spanish.
 Alchemical_Moon#8853: How goes it my dudes
 Lawn#1538: Give it a whirl, you’ll only get better that way
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: How does Italian compare to spanish?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I'm planning on visiting my friend in Hamburg but I feel like I'll be too nervous to actually try to use my German there lol
 Lawn#1538: I used to speak a little Italian, but if you don’t use it you lose it. Now it’s just English and bits and pieces from all over the world.
 K'miinik#3171: yeah,  didn't realize i didn't disable it yet tho
 Wokarol#0940: You can disable it :)
 wren#0640: ive been really slacking on learning toki pona but i like to think im still conversational
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I need to learn Italian. I wanna go to europe soon.
 Wokarol#0940: I know only Polish and English ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Please stick to using English in this discord thank you
 K'miinik#3171: I hate that discord automatically made that an emoji
 Merus#7019: I have been trying to learn Japanese for years now, and it's only like last week that I learned about ichidan and godan verbs
 K'miinik#3171: 🙂
 wren#0640: mi sona e lili toki pona :)
 Merus#7019: I have made a small amount of progress on my Japanese
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I'm learning German at the moment but I haven't done my lessons for a while
 Jeker#3389: Yes, i know dumb question my bad
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Does your first language count as a language you speak? .... You speak it... so yes
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I speak English and Spanish.
 Jeker#3389: Dumb question btw
 Jeker#3389: Greek is my mother language tho so does it count?
 Jeker#3389: You know, i like to think i at least know 3 languages, Greek, German and English
 Wokarol#0940: 3D is just 2D but more
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Yes. That's where we post our devlogs.
 Wokarol#0940: Do I have to visit your OnlyJams for that?
 Jeker#3389: Oh, wow look at me learning spanish
 Wokarol#0940: 😳
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: "Why not both?"
 Merus#7019: you could still work together! you could do UI art and portraits and icons and textures and such
 Jeker#3389: I...i just saw this
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: ~~That's why we have a bathtub.~~
 Lawn#1538: You’re up 
 Jeker#3389: Wait what does it say btw?
 Selviam#7268: yeess
 Wokarol#0940: I want to see a devlog on that
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I can link it to you, if you want. For some inspiration.
 Selviam#7268: Wait thats a great idea
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: No.
 Jeker#3389: ~~Wait is that no bitches in spanish?~~
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Last game we made, we had a 2D artist create all of the enemies and UI for our 3D FPS. It had a bit of a classic DOOM vibe to it. But, it came out good.
 Lawn#1538: Meet in the middle.
 Lawn#1538: You can do a 2.5D game pretty easily with both of your passions.
 Jeker#3389: (Btw thanks again  for bearing with my ass lol)
 Peter Milko#5216: oh 😅
 Selviam#7268: her main focus is 3d modeling and she looves 3d games as much as i love 2d games
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: Damn, I wish i had friends.
 Lawn#1538: Oh yeah, that’s also nice if you can afford it.
 Peter Milko#5216: unless she is making 3d models
 Peter Milko#5216: she can do 2d unity bro lol
 Lawn#1538: ~~Can you imagine 11 people…~~
 Jeker#3389: Well, that sucks, but i guess i was pretty lucky to meet such a talented artist
 Wokarol#0940: Digital pen and paper tho
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Wdym? One team, one dream.
 Lawn#1538: You don’t have to use it at the same time.
 Jeker#3389: Wait uhhh but, only one bathroom
 Jeker#3389: If you consider we are generally friends, yeah its pretty nice
 K'miinik#3171: project files I'd assume
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: Whats in that usb
 Jeker#3389: Yeah i actually know my teamate irl
 Lawn#1538: Or are you posting that?
 Lawn#1538: I presume you’re all working IRL
 Lawn#1538: USB?
 Jeker#3389: I'm using Unity, pen and paper and a usb stick for my team
 Lawn#1538: My favourite are the GraphGear 1000 series. I have some auto feed mechanism ones, but the weight of the Pentels is perfect and the clip is just so useful.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I'm using Unity, Github, Trello and Google Documents for the team.
 Lawn#1538: They are very nice.
 Jeker#3389: Oh nice but lets be honest, mechanicals are better
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: Milanote feels kind of unintuitive sometimes
 Lawn#1538: All pencils are valid.
 Jeker#3389: Infact, give me a sec
 Merus#7019: dang, I can't timeout other mods
 Jeker#3389: **artists would like to talk about this**
 Lawn#1538: ~~Traditional pencils belong in the bin.~~
 Lawn#1538: I’m an avid mechanical pencil collector. So if I say pencil, it implies all types.
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: I always use pen for these things, erasing means getting rid of ideas, I don’t have time for that
 Jeker#3389: There is like, normal pencil and mechanical pencil
 Jeker#3389: No its not a pen
 Lawn#1538: I didn’t do marker, crayon, or pastels
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: Pen
 Lawn#1538: Pretty sure that’s what a pencil is
 Jeker#3389: Wow, not accounting for mechanical pencils, so racist smh smh
 Fraserfatt#1021: the best *not* jira
 Lawn#1538: Milanote is passable.
 Fraserfatt#1021: notion is nice
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: can't beat physical note taking
 Lawn#1538: Pen/pencil and paper ftw.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: notion has kanban board functionality too if you're solo
 Selviam#7268: trello is gonna be a amazing for this jam
 Wokarol#0940: Just a trello board with ideas
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: When I discovered that you could let the dog in civ 6
 Wokarol#0940: I have a list of ideas in general. Good thing to keep
 tykenn#8548: Right up there with dog petting and fishing minigames
 tykenn#8548: Yes. Glowing mushrooms earn bonus points imo
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: I have a list of bad random ideas. I try to do one a day
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: Make a mushroom game, where you are a mushroom. You’re glowing, and everything else is dark. It’s a rougelike, but there’s only one room, except... it changes (dark so you don’t know). You attack by blinding people.
 tykenn#8548: I keep getting stuck on this idea for a surreal farming sim but also know it almost certainly won't work for the jam
 Wokarol#0940: Well, depends what you want from the jam. Do you want to learn or to do something good?
 Jeker#3389: Exactly, its broad enough to be used with something else
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: and a highly debated one too. tell the wrong person that hades is a roguelike and they'll devour you
 birdstone#3073: i have been summoned
 Wokarol#0940: Quite wide one even
 Selviam#7268: i get mad at myself whenever i think of a game idea before the jam because i know ill feel to guilty to go through with the idea once the jam starts no matter *how* fun the idea sounds 😔
 EggoAxolotl#0664: True ig.. I'd at least get familiar with the genre your making that way its not too hard actually developing it during the jam
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: that's just a genre though
 Jeker#3389: The only idea i have is: roguelike
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: exercising on thinking about games given a theme isn't a bad idea tho. just don't think about what game to make, like... 3 days before the jam starts
 Wokarol#0940: And often makes the theme just tacked on poorly
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: eh, you won't get a super cohesive idea to theme as somone who started outright from the theme itself. i'd advise you reserve thinking about possible games for the jam itself to when the theme gets revealed
 Wokarol#0940: Ehhh... kinda defeats the idea of a jam
 EggoAxolotl#0664: I think that's a cool idea, to be prepared to the point of having an idea for a game and changing it slightly to fit the theme
 DomG#9983: Im going to program a entire game that's so vague it can fit any category and use it to cheat and get a time advantage like a dick (I wont)
 CALSYTHE#6648: sounds like a word jam
 AquaduckStudio#0780: im writing all these down in a word document and when the theme gets announced im going to scroll through it and see if anything fits
 Jeker#3389: Maybe i add a krouton as an easter egg or something
 EggoAxolotl#0664: mhm
 Jeker#3389: Yeah thats actually cool
 DomG#9983: Someone should make a game jam named jam games where you make games about jam for the game jam "jam games"
 Wokarol#0940: This rule, as I understand it is about Mark in particular. Because that rules out parody games
 EggoAxolotl#0664: I'd play that
 tykenn#8548: I kind of like the idea of all us discord peeps picking some random prop and hiding one in each of our games as an easter egg
 AquaduckStudio#0780: Game Idea- The bees have taken your family hostage. You have to grow flowers and berries to make pollen and jam to make the bees happy... Or else.
 RiverDog#8199: Ive learned as much about unity in the past week as i have the past two yesrs
 CALSYTHE#6648: game jams make jam games
 EggoAxolotl#0664: or jam in general
 DomG#9983: Specifically gmtk
 EggoAxolotl#0664: Well no because game jams are a universal thing
 tykenn#8548: Jam in general isn't a GMTK reference
 CALSYTHE#6648: jam bottles for everyone!
 DomG#9983: NO!!! YOU'RE WRONG
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: wait are there rules about not referencing gmtk?
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: Is that breaking the rules about referencing gmtk tho?
 EggoAxolotl#0664: That would be funny
 CALSYTHE#6648: we usually call them jars... but yes
 Jeker#3389: "No patrick, mayonaise is not an instrument"
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: Can we have a bottle of jam in our games?
 DomG#9983: My favourite flavour is traffic jam
 Merus#7019: although I think maybe listing various flavours of jam might be better suited for 
 CALSYTHE#6648: i like toe jam
 RiverDog#8199: OG Grape Jam
 DomG#9983: Mayonnaise is a instrument
 CALSYTHE#6648: choco jam is always an option
 Merus#7019: hard to make a jam out of chocolate
 Jeker#3389: Strawberry, you?
 Selviam#7268: if chocolate jam is an option then yes
 CALSYTHE#6648: strawberry jam?  raspberry jam?
 AquaduckStudio#0780: i thought about applying to work for Blizzard..... then i remembered they're a terrible company ethically/morally/ etc
 Jeker#3389: Oh, i get what you mean, let me correct the statement: lets keep political ideologies out of game dev
 DomG#9983: Debating between doing GMTK or Bug Bounty hunting
 Selviam#7268: flavor?
 CALSYTHE#6648: what's your jam flavor?
 EggoAxolotl#0664: That's the dream
 Selviam#7268: maaann i just wanna conceptualizing the game already and get the theme 🥲
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: that's difficult to do when game dev inherently is polticized by being a job that is currently udner the spotlight for being riddled with crunch, but i get the sentiment
 Lawn#1538: Well at least out of this thread. ~~Make whatever games you want~~ make some games.
 Lawn#1538: Yes please.
 Jeker#3389: Lets, generally keep politics out of game dev how about that?
 RiverDog#8199: imma do a honor system where you just type what you think you deserve in the comments
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: It would be funny if someone made a game about making a game about making a game etc.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: let's not try to tackle subjects that are way out of our reach in a 2 day game jam
 Jeker#3389: I hope i get a good gameplay score, i want to be a gameplay programmer at one point maybe
 AquaduckStudio#0780: WAIT. i want to make this game. dibs. no body steal my idea
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i don't know what my game's main focus point is because the theme ain't out yet! 😛
 AquaduckStudio#0780: thatd be funny if someone made a game about communism. the player starts out with a set number of resources, and they have to invent new reasons to persecute small portions of their own citizens. like a game of Guess Who, but if you're too broad then the people realize you're the bad guy.
 Selviam#7268: if i get a decent score in anything its gonna be presentation bc art and design is really the only thing i have going for me
 Jeker#3389: And just, going with that
 Jeker#3389: I am betting on giving the game a lot of character
 Scolon#4218: Well "art" technically isn't a a category for this jam. It's presentation, which encompasses a lot of different things
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: you know, presentation does matter though. a good homepage works and if your gameplay is simple but presented well that's going to elevate it a lot. last years winner was really really REALLY strong in presentation
 Merus#7019: I've been spicy enough today
 RocketCow#5210: ~~based~~
 Jeker#3389: Ok this might be a bit innapropriate but i read "Communism is ideal" lmao
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: Just don’t expect to win in art, focus on making really good gameplay/music (whatever you into)
 Merus#7019: just arriving at something everyone's excited to work on is going to be pretty tricky
 Jeker#3389: Ohh
 AquaduckStudio#0780: sounds like resume material 😮
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: oh yeah i'm talking about like. above 6-7 people in a team
 Scolon#4218: Yeah in a game jam setting the end product isn't going to be wildly different from small teams/solo
 Merus#7019: communication will be a big deal
 Jeker#3389: I just suck at art and really wanted an artist
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: more people is less an exercise of game design itself and more an exercise in game management and cohesion of vision, which are perfectly fine skills to exercise in a jam, honestly
 Jeker#3389: May your crashes be few
 AquaduckStudio#0780: he is now Shadow the assistant to the regional manager
 RiverDog#8199: may your procrastination be light
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: It’s easier but more stressful with more people
 Jeker#3389: Thanks mate :))
 Merus#7019: last year Shadow was going by Shadow DA BOSS so presumably he's gotten a demotion since then
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: Well... good luck!
 Jeker#3389: Ironicly enough, its my first non-solo jam
 AquaduckStudio#0780: i wonder about an 11 person team having 11 different points of personality conflicts, plus you have groupthink to deal with, and dissociation of responsibilities.
11 people is going to require a very, very good leader
 RiverDog#8199: haha wow its a parable
 Merus#7019: and that's why you shouldn't trust billionaires!
 Merus#7019: it's a good life lesson: when you can only score like 100,000 points max, and you look at the leaderboards, you can assume that whoever's managed to score 2 million is really good at the game but the people who have 300 billion have probably cheated somehow
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i want to get in cybersec eventually so getting really paranoid about every single possible security problem seems reasonable to me
 Scolon#4218: Try not to raise your expectations (for anything really) too high
 RiverDog#8199: honestly im most excited for this jam because its my first solo
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: ahh. well, true enough
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: Better be good lol
 Jeker#3389: 11 people is kinda ridicilous lol, looking forward to their game
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: Not with the leader board but to mess with it
 RiverDog#8199: lol diabolical
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: there's people with 11 people teams (hi shadow), of course people will bother
 Merus#7019: exactly
 AquaduckStudio#0780: thats what i was thinking.. realistically out of the handful of people here whos going to sabotage a leaderboard lol
 RiverDog#8199: ooh someone will just find the push json or whatever and screw with it?
 Jeker#3389: What about security?
 Scolon#4218: You'd be surprised
 Merus#7019: oh my yes
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: Is someone really going to bother
 Scolon#4218: Yeah it's kinda easy to cheat them no matter what you do 🤔
You'd need some sort of moderation systems
 Jeker#3389: Its still something, not a lot of people, including myself, want to go through setting up
 Merus#7019: the problem with leaderboards, which you've surely seen if you've seen leaderboards before, is once someone works out how to send arbitrary requests your leaderboard becomes useless
 AquaduckStudio#0780: servers are a lot easier than people think tbh. a simple highscore server could be thrown together in half an hour
 RiverDog#8199: i did not realize there were public servers we could leverage
 Merus#7019: but anyway I appreciate you knowing your limits and not making me do mod work
 Kira#7896: It goes down or lags a lot. Safest to upload a working build a couple hours before it ends. And add your final build at the end.
 Jeker#3389: Yep, i am generally really agressive
 Merus#7019: that sounds like it might not be the argument that's the problem but how you conduct it?
 Kira#7896: Huh? I'm not arguing with you. Anyways.
 Jeker#3389: You know, i actually like being in the server, so i will not continue this argument cause every argument in any server i am in ends with me getting banned
 Kira#7896: Not everyone. But a lot of people have an existing one or set one up.
 Merus#7019: he talked about it in the patron channels about a month back
 Scolon#4218: It is
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: this has to be the most popular game jam around
 Jeker#3389: I think they didnt last year
 wren#0640: have the itch servers gone down at the end of the jam every year?
 Jeker#3389: Ok, reality check here, you think everyone would be willing or even be able to, host a server?
 Scolon#4218: Not actually coding anything, just the workflow for implementing it
 Scolon#4218: Yeah I'm going to look into highscoring systems before the jam starts, since that might be something I want to do
 Scolon#4218: and itch.io probably has systems in place to scan files
 Kira#7896: Yeah, most WebGL games with highscores just save them to a server.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i think if that ever happens that it would go against ToS rules for itch and get the person who posted the virus in trouble
 Scolon#4218: I mean it's against itch.io ToS to upload malware so like
They'd just get banned lol
 Jeker#3389: WebGL cant save scores
 Jeker#3389: Fair point, but what if someone wants to make a game all about high scoring?
 birdstone#3073: was gonna say something from its always sunny but i don't think that's appropriate here lol
 Jeker#3389: Every big server will have its share
 RiverDog#8199: outside feedback i guess, its impossible to know if thw exe is just gonna reformat the c drive for fun
 BestofHector#1731: It starts in 3 days
 Viola_Buddy#6763: (Wow, and we were saying there were no trolls in here)
 BestofHector#1731: Thanks
 Jeker#3389: True
 wren#0640: really should fix that tbh
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: You need to wake up. The game jam started 2 days ago. Let her go.
 wren#0640: timers a bit off mate
 birdstone#3073: timer is off
 Jeker#3389: Yeah exactly, Merus thats so messed up
 birdstone#3073: you are in denial
 DrNukeLear#2414: It’s marmalade time!
 wren#0640: ? mods shoudnt lie
 Merus#7019: do not believe these lies
 Merus#7019: to reiterate: the jam has not yet started!
 dunstad#6767: running an exe does mean taking a risk, there's no scan itch can do on uploaded files to determine if they'll harm your computer. most people are trustworthy luckily
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: some rice?
 Merus#7019: what did _I_ just come back to
 birdstone#3073: return of amongi
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: ... What did I just come back to lol
 Jeker#3389: How about we both get out?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: "in his little mark brown voice"
 L3mmy♡#2307: You get out if you don't want bad quality jokes Jeker-
 birdstone#3073: mandela catalogue
 wren#0640: friday the 15th mark brown says in his little mark brown voice "And the theme is "An Imposter amongst us".
 L3mmy♡#2307: No-
 Jeker#3389: Ok thats it get out
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: Among us sus sussie sus
 L3mmy♡#2307: Sus-
 Jeker#3389: That would actually be kinda cool ngl
 wren#0640: among us
 birdstone#3073: LOL now i feel bad
 RiverDog#8199: theme is: deception
 Jeker#3389: Damn dude...i am not mad you tried to troll the guy, i am mad i didnt think of it first lol
 birdstone#3073: I am indeed
 Diet_Water_#2717: started 2 days ago
 wren#0640: evil
 Jeker#3389: Nope not yet
 birdstone#3073: yes it has a few hours ago
 Diet_Water_#2717: can't argue with that
 BestofHector#1731: Has the jam started
 wren#0640: that is simply the dev being On The Grind
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: that's straight up evil
 RiverDog#8199: yea they feel like a virus about to encrypt my hard drive and ask for 100$ in crypto
 Jeker#3389: I once found a crypto miner on itch
 Viola_Buddy#6763: I don't know what checks they have for that, but I'm pretty sure you can upload most things to itch.io.
 Diet_Water_#2717: exe's just have a different feel about them
 Jeker#3389: Oh hoho boy do i have some news for you
 Fraserfatt#1021: I've been just slappin things into exes recently
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: webgl is just better to get more people to play the game
 RiverDog#8199: lol
 Shinon#6104: ~~B-But performance!~~
 Fraserfatt#1021: I'd prefer to do webgl, though optimization is rough for some of the 3d projects I've had
 wren#0640: i trust itch to not host viruses lol
 RiverDog#8199: can we all agree that web hosted games are the best option for jams?  i dont kno who still downloads and runs a random .exe
 Jeker#3389: "Hey, the name' Aster, I inveted path finding"
"What the hell are you talking about? I am calling the police"
 wren#0640: oh man SAHcons on during the jam
 Jeker#3389: Or even one that fakes attacks, the sky is the limit
 Jeker#3389: You can also use that to make a cheecky enemy, that attacks and then retreats
 Jeker#3389: Yeah exactly
 Merus#7019: ah, fair enough; it really is a pathfinding algorithm rather than AI in general
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: Asgore... from undertale...
 Shinon#6104: "Hi, names's called Aster"
"You invented pathfinding?!"
 Jeker#3389: For example, an object will start following one immedietly, which isnt ideal for enemy behaviour
 lilburlap#8480: aster
 Lawn#1538: ayyy Star
 Shinon#6104: ã Star
 Lawn#1538: I read it like the Fonz.
 Viola_Buddy#6763: ...Or something. I actually am quite lost
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: something something starfinder
 Viola_Buddy#6763: Oh A*. I kept reading that as "a star" like "one star" ⭐
 Jeker#3389: It allows for custom scripts through C#, in Unity at least
 Shinon#6104: Try pathfinding in a starship with that.
 Merus#7019: isn't the whole point of A* that the magic is in the scoring mechanism?
 Merus#7019: how... how do you customise A*?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: hey a* star is useful. i still gotta learn a* star
 Jeker#3389: Now yes, its a star BUT its a really customized super set of a star
 Merus#7019: hard disagree, I'm never banning someone for a pun
 Shinon#6104: You can't ban someone for a horrible joke.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: mods, this is ban worthy...
 lilburlap#8480: Oh that's genius
 Viola_Buddy#6763: Ai ai, captain
 Jeker#3389: Unity
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: what engine are you using jeker?
 Jeker#3389: So i will just, shamelesly re-use that, along with my sound manager
 Shinon#6104: I really need to learn AI eventually xd
 Merus#7019: thank you, Jeker, let's all move on and talk about Jeker's AI
 wren#0640: ive seen most of the other major ones but not that
 Jeker#3389: I am so glad i have figured out ai for another project
 wren#0640: i actually dont think ive ever seen the image for that one?
 lilburlap#8480: I'm too young and naive for this
 Fraserfatt#1021: takes me back to unfortunate elementary school
 Shinon#6104: game idea:
Not some football league.
You control a bunch of Rowdy kids that got roped into a football league somehow. Using nothing but flashing lights.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i was 12 and gullible too once
 Fraserfatt#1021: 🙃
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: Do not
 wren#0640: a certain blue breakfast food
 Merus#7019: the worst I know of are medical conditions
 DrNukeLear#2414: There are reason social media moderator teams have high turnover from PTSD.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: someone did that to me this year and they need to be very glad they're a close friend becuase otherwise that shit would not have flown
 Merus#7019: yes, I am an Old so I know a few but I am also being responsible so I can't actually give you any examples
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: stuff that people in 2008 would send to each other over IM without warning for the laughter, that definitely wouldn't fly nowadays
 Gallow#3741: "Not some football league"
 lilburlap#8480: I physically shuddered when you sent that
 Fraserfatt#1021: not safe football league
 Fraserfatt#1021: looked like some sorta football league from first glance
 Shinon#6104: Stuff that people will go: "What the... "
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: always wondered what NSFL stood for
 DrNukeLear#2414: And worse
 wren#0640: yeah
 Shinon#6104: Yea
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: so i assume like, gore?
 Merus#7019: Not Safe For Life is something you wouldn't want to see even if you're an adult in the privacy of your own home
 Shinon#6104: I used it have that I think, but over time you'll just get tired of it.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: hey it has good sides and bad sides! when i was 15 i was convinced i could make an expansive 16 character beat em up 2d game on my own with two friends, and Trying to do that (and obviously not succeeding) was a great learning experience in scope
 lilburlap#8480: Ok ty
 wren#0640: nsfw is like porn nsfl is like horrible grotesque stuff
 Lawn#1538: Mornin’
 Merus#7019: no rule that says ~~a dog can't play basketball~~ that stickers _shouldn't_ work
 lilburlap#8480: Is there a difference between nsfw and nsfl or can that not be discussed in server?
 wren#0640:
 Jonathor#1971: Lol was that not supposed to work?
 Merus#7019: oh I see stickers work
 Merus#7019: at least I'll probably be able to tell if it's NSFW/L by the reaction
 Jonathor#1971:
 Merus#7019: you can still link, I guess
 lilburlap#8480: I keep forgetting no images
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: young people tend to have that kind of over ambitious mindset that inadvertently makes them Sooooooomewhat toxic
 Gallow#3741: It's prophetic
 DrNukeLear#2414: Yeah
 Shinon#6104: *Nice*
 wren#0640: exactly
 Gallow#3741: will be on the #1 spot on the game ranking
 DrNukeLear#2414: They didn’t seem to get the concept.
 Gallow#3741: next time we see that guy's name
 wren#0640: yepp
 Shinon#6104: GMTK is not like a "winning" kinda jam. At best you'll just get featured on mark's videos which is nice.
 lilburlap#8480: The one with full capitalized beginning words?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: dont remember that
 Jonathor#1971: Sure go ahead
 wren#0640: i can dm you screenshots of their messages if youd like
 DrNukeLear#2414: Is that the one who arrived ranted about winning and then left?
 Shinon#6104: Oh joy
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: don't remember much, seemed like someone younger than 15 maybe?
 Merus#7019: mmm, odd is a good description
 Jonathor#1971: What do you mean odd?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i saw this person yesterday i think
 wren#0640: C00L C0DER#2803 is their @ if you wanna message them about the team but they were a bit odd before they left to say the least
 lilburlap#8480: Yeah all I see is the ID
 DrNukeLear#2414: I think that happens if you still share a server.
 Merus#7019: ah, interesting, I see the Discord userid
 wren#0640: im guessing because i saw them in the server?
 wren#0640: shows up as their @ for me
 Shinon#6104: At least, it's better than running raw like GLFW with some matrix math library.
 Jonathor#1971: Did he get banned or? Not sure how i'm supposed to contact him
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: how do you know from the number???
 wren#0640: i remember that guy they left the server a while ago
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: huh
 Merus#7019: I'm told this might happen if they're not in the server
 Jonathor#1971: Or is my discord bugged lol?
 Jonathor#1971: Guys can you help me, 992556749963931648 pinged me but I can't get his user? check  i think he is bugged or something
 lilburlap#8480: Sometimes someone says something completely random and it just clicks everything in place
 Jonathor#1971: 
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Gl rest in peace 
 Shinon#6104: Like recently I discovered raylib is a thing, and hell do I want to try to make a game in C++ again.
 lilburlap#8480: True but I saw someone explaining color pallets in another channel and it was extremely helpful
 Selviam#7268: for coding how often should i try to review it so i dont end up forgetting it
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: C++ it's literally just gibberish no cap. Every other language has a format, and then c++is just a mess
 Shinon#6104: A bunch of learning is finding out some new toy and just playing around with it
 lilburlap#8480: I do really like talking to older more experienced people because half the time I don't understand what they're saying and it's so cool to see that happen and half the time it feels like I'm skipping ahead a year of work
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: but the thread version was interesting. working with shared memory was fun to a degree
 Shinon#6104: oh... oh yeah definitely...
 Fraserfatt#1021: I'm old, I got some credentials 👴
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i'd take c++ game in text over c game in ncruses forced to make every entity a process and using pipes for communication
 Shinon#6104: Our first group project game was in C++ in text, so that wasn't any better.
 lilburlap#8480: That's better than just sorta going through highschool with good grades but not challenging yourself... I think?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: required to get my final grade on this btw. it's almost done and it has been hell
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: woe to my operating systems professor who thought it was a good idea to make a systems programming based ncurses space invaders clone in C project
 DrNukeLear#2414: My academic qualifications are over a decade and a half old and don’t reflect my skill set.
 Shinon#6104: F
 Shinon#6104: You'll get rusty. Kinda why I want to join the game jam to derust my unity.
 Shinon#6104: Ah you mean that, yeah 😛
 lilburlap#8480: You adults and your academic credentials
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: oh no yeah but like. still. if you're doing stuff on your own it's not the most ideal solution
 Shinon#6104: Not really starting out kind, I do have papers to show I had a diploma in game dev, so I do know my way around.
 DrNukeLear#2414: UDK wasn’t bad for indies though.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: yeah, unreal is not the best if you're just starting out, it's mostly addressed for bigger teams with experience in the field
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Afternoon
 DrNukeLear#2414: Morning
 lilburlap#8480: eyyy toh pfp
 Shinon#6104: Hello!
 Strangespañol#1093: Hi!
 Shinon#6104: And on the topic of game engines, I personally use Unity, touched unreal but the sheer horror of manually compiling UE4 on my laptop and it crashing makes me not wanna use it again XD
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i love those things they're great to play to learn and also just fun to play in general. great mind ticklers
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: it's an excellent tool to teach programming concepts without getting into code itself, it's among my favorite along puzzle games where you have to give instructions to your character as a list of action that gets executed sequentially
 lilburlap#8480: I actually tried making scratch in scratch once it didn't go well
 flameguy21#8407: make a c++ compiler in scratch
 Shinon#6104: Reminds me my very first game I made was some shooter game made in pygame within a week.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: true!
 Shinon#6104: Ye, but at least they *work*
 lilburlap#8480: Scratch is good as an educational tool and can be used for some smaller ideas but it definitely falls apart once you stat making something scaled up
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: they wont embed, but yes
 Shinon#6104: ~~can't send images but can send links right?~~
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: and again, any judgement i made of any engine is really like... a joke, really. i have 3 engines (unity which i dont use so often, game maker studio and godot) and i think that every engine is good becuase each engine is specialized to do something. i'll defend stuff like rpg maker, scratch, and game engines without programming forever because they have a point, like all engines do
 lilburlap#8480: This makes scratch completely useless in this server noooo
 Hobusu#5033: Only patrons can
 lilburlap#8480: Wait I can't send images
 M_Raven#4076: GameObject.Find(“Your Mom”);
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: It goes sprites, gamer objects, then fuck everything else
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Truth
 lilburlap#8480: We all know that sprites are the best method
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i just said that i completely forgot what game objects are in unity because i'm more used to nodes
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: 🧢
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: ? made no judgement about which one is better in general
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Please consider that some people do prefer unity over godot
 M_Raven#4076: Gameo🅱️ject
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i forgot what gameobjects are. the game object is dead, long live the node
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: I'm going to ignore that
 M_Raven#4076: It can be both
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: I can't tell if that's an insult, or you understanding the pain 😫
 lilburlap#8480: dw I've already got my own
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: I have a system I used for an Undertale copy that uses clones to type text into a box using a custom command. You can add a separate sprite for empty, and another one for space(don't make me explain why you need sperate over) and just use a small bit of code to implement text editing
I could send it to u
 redka#6365: I'm sorry implying GameObject is understood by normal people overstates the sanity of Unity devs
 lilburlap#8480: Wait actually it shouldn't be too hard I already have a sprite (Think gameobject for you normal people) that can display text in a funky font so all I need to do is hook that up to the individual keys
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: 💀
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Major emoji mistake
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: 🥲
 lilburlap#8480: Alright this shouldn't be too hard in scratch
 M_Raven#4076: Ive heard of it and seen gameplay
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i think with godot's tools making a text editor wouldn't be too difficult? like i'm considering the stuff that the engine provides, and the text itself could be a very long and wide text field. then using buttons you could do stuff to selected text through rich text stuff
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Bad grammar moment 😫
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Anybody else know what Typoman is? God I probably sound like a little kid for knowing what the hell this is but I imagined a text editor game where you mod Google docs or something to make it so you can put letters in places and change where they are and use symbols to make the world. And you're traveling across the world, and when you go to a different country that place world is made out of characters from the native language
 tykenn#8548: And then use that notepad to make another game within that game
 M_Raven#4076: Just make a new operating system in your game
 Fraserfatt#1021: code an extremely complex notepad *into* your game 😎
 birdstone#3073: that's probably a better idea since i remember the game should be kept to the game itself and not require other applications
you could also probably add a little note that says "writing somewhere else might be helpful"
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: I'm not allowed to mean so I am going to be a calm kind individual and politely ask you to stop
 lilburlap#8480: I kinda want to have something more easily permanent but ig I could give the player the text editor and let them write it down instead if they want
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: Sus from amongus! Sussie. Sus! amongus
 birdstone#3073: GREAT IDEA
 wren#0640: the theme is suspicious character
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Or make a game in a text editor 😎
 birdstone#3073: you don't know how much i see amongi every day
 birdstone#3073: that would be really interesting, i think probably a better idea is to have a text editor in game
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: O
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: Like from Amongus? Haha
 lilburlap#8480: Sorry my brain went immediately to google docs I just thought it'd be funny if I made a solo journaling game
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: 🤔 sus
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Idk. Then it would become aa ARG(or im just saying stuff because it's 12am)
 birdstone#3073: i'm not sure but out of curiousity why do you need google docs lol
 lilburlap#8480: Do you think it'd be allowed if my game required you to open google docs or any place to type/write stuff?
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: 🤯
 tykenn#8548: Making a game is something we don't always want to do, but we always want to have done it.
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Lmao
 birdstone#3073: i think i'm just tired today but i misread "college considers" as colonel sanders
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: starting out with unreal is not a good choice im going to be honest. too much going on, and the tool is intended for big industry stuff more than anyone
 redka#6365: It is
 BurnV06#5857: One of my motivations is that my future college considers applications based on portfolios of games you have created or worked on in the past. So I want to get a good portfolio ready for when I graduate high school
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: oh god that sounds terrible
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: I love making games in unreak
 redka#6365: Because my only 3D experience was with Unreal
 birdstone#3073: yw, seriously though your game stuck around in my mind for a while
 lilburlap#8480: Ok
 wren#0640: oh its from scott pilgrim
 redka#6365: I used to hate 3D so much
 lilburlap#8480:  Where is your pfp from it looks very familiar?
 TheChronicPhenix#1205: Holy sh*t I've been recognized for something, you made my day
 birdstone#3073: that sounds like a good plan
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: and if i fail, whatever! means i gotta go hang out in the seven day jams circle a bit more before i try my hand at 2 day jams
 birdstone#3073: HEY YOU MADE YOUR STRENGTH IS MINE
I STILL LOVE THAT CONCEPT
 birdstone#3073: we believe in you
 BurnV06#5857: Same
 wren#0640: ive missed the deadline on my past few but ive taken a break since and i feel a lot more confident now
 lilburlap#8480: I like the act of making stuff so I usually don't finish what I'm making but I have a fun time doing it
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: that was my last jam, and honestly it's why im here, because my attitude allowed me to think positively about it. getting 43/150 with a decent game with good ambiance and some bugs is an excellent result for me
 wren#0640: i think im gonna be able to submit this jam
 TheChronicPhenix#1205: My motivation is just to have something fun, something largely lacking from previous jam submissions lol
 birdstone#3073: finish something and be proud of it, that's good
 M_Raven#4076: In all seriousness my motivation is to just finish something
 birdstone#3073: lmao it's sad how true this is
 birdstone#3073: i learned something new today, ty
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: ya need to work on that or otherwise if you get in the industry bosses are gonna exploit that attitude from ya
 birdstone#3073: which is not a good thing i'm looking to change from that lol
 Teslobo#8274: Technically yes but that's motivation derived from adrenaline and cortisol. When people talk about "motivation" they tend to mean dopamine
 M_Raven#4076: Stairway to burnout
 birdstone#3073: hahaha i am the embodiment of unhealthy working
 lilburlap#8480: Same my parents just needed confirmation
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: Extremely unhealthy ! Don't do that !
 nekiwo#7574: its much easier to be motivated than a regular project because its only for 48 hours
 birdstone#3073: can it be considered motivation if i literally think to myself something bad will happen if i don't finish on time so i can't stop working
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: the only motivation i get is to improve, so i dont have much of a choice but be motivated lol
 BurnV06#5857: I don’t need to take an ADHD test. Just interact with me for one minute and it’s blatantly obvious
 Teslobo#8274: Doctor gave me a checkbox for symptoms, much better than the shitty excel I made
 lilburlap#8480: I can only stay motivated if I'm actively experimenting with something
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i'm honestly considering whether i should prep a symptom list with my experiences for it for when i go to the psych but then i realize the instinct not to do it is probably just my executive dysfunction fighting against me
 birdstone#3073: these are sad answers
 Teslobo#8274: Based answer
 Teslobo#8274: I don't
 M_Raven#4076: I don’t
 birdstone#3073: how do you guys stay motivated during jams if you've done them before?
 lilburlap#8480: That'd be a very productive study session for an adhd test tbf
 birdstone#3073:  i want to cry
*in a good way ofc*
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I dont study. I'm just naturally good at taking tests.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: we need to study for it??? oh shit. uhhhhh. uhhhhhhhhhh (stays up to midnight up to the test doing nothing at all)
 BurnV06#5857: Both sides have the same controls
 birdstone#3073: ooo fun, ill give it a try
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Ayooo. Lmao.
 lilburlap#8480: I got diagnosed with adhd a lil early on and I've just been here
 Teslobo#8274: But I need to copy your answers for the prostate exam
It’s also like the buggiest thing ever made
 Teslobo#8274: I'm sure I'll pass that test, I've been studying
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i'm in the process to asking for a psych appointment for one! good luck to everyone else looking to get diagnosed! you got this!
 birdstone#3073: it's a great learning experience, you get to learn from more experienced developers
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Oh, dang. Hope you pass!
 M_Raven#4076: Just clone yourself ez
 BurnV06#5857: I have extremely severe adhd
 birdstone#3073: nah my eyes are separate entities that would be childs play
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: this is going to be a great chance to solidify my godot skills honestly
 BurnV06#5857: Because I made a game where you play two different games at the same time on different halves of the screen, unaware that human brains don’t work like that
 M_Raven#4076: I haven’t gotten an official diagnosis yet but I really want one
 birdstone#3073: :(
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: adhd havers unite
 birdstone#3073: wooooo goodluck, you got this
 cathy#3897: i never figured out how to play it
 M_Raven#4076: I participate despite not having the capacity to concentrate as much as required in a short deadline because I am masochistic
 birdstone#3073: if i'm under a time restraint i become manic and can't stop working
 Teslobo#8274: I never change my pfp
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: need to specify this is my first gmtk jam and the last jam i had was a beginners jam that lasted 7 days
 Teslobo#8274: Smh
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: TIL Dreddlobo is Teslobo. Lol.
 BurnV06#5857: I accidentally made it bats**t insanely hard, to the point of near unplayability
 Teslobo#8274: I'm not participating because I absolutely do not have the capacity to concentrate as much as required in a short deadline
 M_Raven#4076: Oh my *god* you should’ve seen mine, it was so janky
 birdstone#3073: lol we clutched in 41st somehow
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: my game last jam had plenty of bugs but honestly i learned a lot, and it was honestly kind of cool; the game had really nice ambiance
 birdstone#3073: hey that isn't bad
 cathy#3897: but you did it
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Not bad! Good work!
 M_Raven#4076: I forgot what my game placed last year
 Teslobo#8274: This year you get to make brand new mistakes
 birdstone#3073: oh no we've all basically lost
 BurnV06#5857: My game was like 2000th out of 5000. Looking back should’ve probably been lower because I sucked at game dev back then
 birdstone#3073: wooo, that's what matters
 M_Raven#4076: I hired your mom
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Nah. We placed pretty low last year. But, I learned from my mistakes! It wont happen again!
 birdstone#3073: this sounds like one of those clickbait youtubers
 M_Raven#4076: Goddamn
 BurnV06#5857: I hired all developers in every video game company with a revenue of over 100k dollars in 2021
 birdstone#3073: did you make it last year?
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Ah. Lol. Yeah, I'm aiming for top 100. But, idk how feasible that is. I have a lot on my plate a s the leader for this team.
 birdstone#3073: dw i hired 40 developers on fiverr nobody can stop me
 BurnV06#5857: Yeah. It’s a joke about how people think a bigger team size automatically makes your game better
 birdstone#3073: lol getting into the top 100 is a challenge itself
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Who me?
 BurnV06#5857: He’s gonna get in the top 20 guaranteed
 lilburlap#8480: I had to miss a couple sessions that campaign and the excuse was always that I was caught trying to sabotage them
 Space_Farmer#9620: has the info that you need in the "Further Details"
 redka#6365: me and my 8 teammates started making a dummy project and we like it so much we might make it a full thing
 Teslobo#8274: He's linking it because that page answers any questions you may have
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: That's what *I'm* saying. Lol.
 AquaduckStudio#0780: sweet. your game better be good then
 Yassin Wessam Games Studio#2503: i JOINED
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Sorry, mate. I already got 11 teammates. Lol.
 birdstone#3073: *how about 4d*
 Yassin Wessam Games Studio#2503: This IS The Game Jame link I join MANN
 Teslobo#8274: I assume you've tried using the team finder?
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I don't mind working in 3D in Unity. It's a welcome challenge.
 lilburlap#8480: Ok so pretty much everything in that business rivalry was him having bad plans that didn't work out. At 3rd level he gained legal ownership of the building because one of my long term goals was to make a shrine to his god but there was a tea shop from a chain he didn't like across the street so he made his own to try to steal their customers. Unfortunately he ordered a lot of the stuff in not-dwarf-size so he would serve customers by wheeling himself around on a swivel chair and using those grabby-hand sticks. The rival tea shop undercut his prices for the last time and he tried ruining the tea they had in store by putting bits of spoiled meat in their bags. He was caught in the storage closet and he threw a firebolt and missed, setting the whole building on fire. The other party members woke up next morning to find that the entire block had burned down because of the large amount of dry leaves being scattered to the wind.
 birdstone#3073: ooo fun
 AquaduckStudio#0780: is anyone looking for a team? 😄
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I joined after I did last year's one. Because I already really liked the emojis. I actually got to help set up the latest batch of emojis!
 Yassin Wessam Games Studio#2503: 👍
 M_Raven#4076: Three windows
 Space_Farmer#9620: this has all the info that you need
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: how on earth do you make drone physics
 birdstone#3073: but can it run two windows?
 redka#6365: 3D is so cool but i hate how you do it in Unity and Unreal
 Yassin Wessam Games Studio#2503: Yup It Can Run One Windows
 M_Raven#4076: If your engine’s game can be run on Windows by itself, it’s allowed
 birdstone#3073: i might think about joining this year
 Scolon#4218: no external downloads, it has to run natively
 Yassin Wessam Games Studio#2503: what ?
 JuliusCube#8501: *most operating systems
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I think it's an inside joke among patrons. Cant remember if the public jammers know of it.
 Teslobo#8274: I do not know the theme but I believe Mark is partial to a bit of weird. Brace yourself appropriately
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Not *any.* They seen to have trouble running on Macs. But they run on mobile just fine. Lol.
 Space_Farmer#9620: the rule are "if it runs on windows with no aditional software its good"
 Yassin Wessam Games Studio#2503: Hey Am Using Upbge 0.2.5a So I can Publish My Game ?
 Yassin Wessam Games Studio#2503: Hey Am Using Upbge 0.2.5a So I can Publish My Game ?
 Scolon#4218: Browser games don't have to be downloaded and they run on any operating system
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Exactly! Keep that on the forefront of your mind when it's time to submit!
 Space_Farmer#9620: i hope this year theam would not be wierd
 AquaduckStudio#0780: i made a high quality 3d tower defense game for a jam once... like 2 people actually took the time to download it :/
 birdstone#3073: yeah you get way more ratings with browser games compared to downloadable ones
 AquaduckStudio#0780: ive found browser games get more ratings because its easier for people to play
 M_Raven#4076: No way, you too?!
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: (and a tip: browser is suggested because it's immediately more playable than a downloadable game)
 birdstone#3073: please enlighten me of this civil war
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: It can be made in anything, as long as you upload a version of your game that runs on windows or browser.
 AquaduckStudio#0780: okay thanks
 Scolon#4218: It doesn't matter what you use as long as the submitted files are allowed
 Teslobo#8274: You can use unity, assuming this isn't a pun
 AquaduckStudio#0780: does GMTK have to be made with game maker or can i use unity?
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Story time!
 M_Raven#4076: I wanna hear this story now
 lilburlap#8480: He burned to death trying to sabotage a rival tea shop it was great
 wren#0640: political favours from the gmtk mods
 lilburlap#8480: My first character was the standard constantly drunk dwarf
 Teslobo#8274: Are you one of those people that get in important peoples good graces to get leniency on the rules
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: my first character was an half elf bard with 19 cha. she was the face of the party. problem: her personality made her intensely shy and bad at talking to people.
 Teslobo#8274: [checks to see if we're friends]
 birdstone#3073: I fall up the stairs when I'm half awake that is just me
 lilburlap#8480: Hello there
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: 3d in Godot does feel a lot more approachable honestly, but that's because stuff like unity tries to have a very big and solid physics engine
 Peter Milko#5216: Aye aye yall
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I already have several helpers friended. 😈
 lilburlap#8480: I run into walls without looking sometimes so that is just me
 wren#0640: my first character was like that
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: that's not an insult that's just me
 Teslobo#8274: "20 INT, 8 WIS" is a surprisingly useful insult
 lilburlap#8480: Ok that made me snort for a second
 birdstone#3073: hahaha i made 1D games
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i DM like 2 games in my playgroup of course i would throw out random dnd references lol
 redka#6365: 3D is so fun when its not locked behind 20 stupid things
 lilburlap#8480: Oh dang it's pretty
 birdstone#3073: i love this community
 wren#0640: oh fuck yes a little tray of garlic bread just for me
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: seduction would be a mind controlling effect so that would mean it's immune to mind controlling effects, and that's either an ability or just having 3 or lower int
 redka#6365: i used to hate 3D until i learnt how to make it in Godot
 lilburlap#8480: I pull out the garlic bread
 birdstone#3073: that's a great style
 birdstone#3073: "seduction immunity"
 wren#0640: asexual troll
 wren#0640: troll is immune to ice damage and seduction sorry
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: It is my goal to befriend all the mods in the servers I'm active in.
 birdstone#3073: thanks i choked on water
 lilburlap#8480: I'd like to seduce the troll
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i cast ray of frost on the troll
 Viola_Buddy#6763: Ooh if you want me to troll I can troll! *You shall not pass my bridge, little billie goats, unless you answer my riddles three!*
 birdstone#3073: thank you for your service
 M_Raven#4076: There was one person being homophobic last year and that’s all I remember
 Hobusu#5033: pls no
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Just wait until I'm more active. 😈
 Teslobo#8274: We've had a couple of trolls so far this year but it's nothing drastic
 birdstone#3073: bruh
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i saw one today who just straight up entered and said the n slur!
 birdstone#3073: even when the server opens to the public everyone's pretty chill, i've only seen like 1 troller and that was last year
 Teslobo#8274: That's why they recruit more temp mods like me
 Viola_Buddy#6763: Oh these few weeks must be a real pain for the mods when you get an influx of people like me 😈
 Teslobo#8274: It's usually less about certain people and more issues caused by current events stirring emotions
 Teslobo#8274: Yeah it's rare the patron section has issues
 Hobusu#5033: Yeah, it's rare that much moderation is needed in the patron-only channels
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i imagine that the server doesn't need too much moderation since patron is a self-filtering system in a way. you don't get much people entering just for the sake of trolling or something. unless they really really really want to troll this server
 lilburlap#8480: So if you want to win the 11v11 you need to wait until after the jam so they have the minimum amount of fighters
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Then we see em again next year.
 Teslobo#8274: Yes
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: They also get Thanosed afterwards.
 Teslobo#8274: 3 mods normally. Extra 5 for the jam period
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Everyone you see, minus the mod helpers. They're only here for the Jam.
 Hobusu#5033: Yep!
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: hey, if they can't find a way to deal with zoning, it's a deserved win!
 lilburlap#8480: Wait how many staff members does the server have?
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: That can only get you so far in the big leagues! Lmao.
 Hobusu#5033: When I played MvC1 I mostly won by spamming Mega Buster charge shots and Hadoukens, lol
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Nowhere near as active as it is here/now. But, still decently active.
 Teslobo#8274: Very
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: once i get out of college and get a job, Maybe i will be here with a patron role. one day
 wren#0640: how active is the server outside of jam times?
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Patrons have multiple channels. You can talk about it like 12 times a day.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Captain Commando all day! Lol.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i just want the patron role to chill and talk about The Definition of Games every day 3 times a day
 Hobusu#5033: So I've heard!
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Aw, damn. MvC2 is the best MvC. It has the most characters and the best movesets, imo.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i don't want the responsibility tho
 Viola_Buddy#6763: I feel like that joke about Italians not being able to talk when their hands are tied, except it's me with emoji reactions
 RocketCow#5210: oh, this is big brain time
 Teslobo#8274: Bowser only
 Hobusu#5033: I'm not too familiar with the game sadly, only played MvC1 for like half an hour
 Viola_Buddy#6763: I just want to be able to emoji-react to things.
 RocketCow#5210: Melee, Final Destination, Fox only?
 Teslobo#8274: Nope. Give Mark money or get Thanos'd post-jam
 lilburlap#8480: You challenge them for the mod role
 M_Raven#4076: I’m over here just playing Brawlhalla
 wren#0640: if youre a mod but you stop being a patron do you still lose server access?
 M_Raven#4076: The misspelling of Beast makes this even funnier
 Hobusu#5033: If you can't find Smash, Fantasy Strike is free to play so you could download that and I could invite you to a friend match
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: question: if i beat one of the mods here in smash do i get to stay after the jam is done with a patron role
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Ofc. If I can find it. My nieces probably stole it from me again. Lol.
 Teslobo#8274: Final destination no items
 Hobusu#5033: In Smash, right?
 lilburlap#8480: Nonono 11v11
 wren#0640: i wonder how many under 13's get banned for leaking their ages every year
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I wanna 1v1 one of the mods when this is all over. 
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: with 15k entering total there is going to be jimmy, 13, asking help on how to make Patformer Beest on unity ten times per second on game-jam-tech-help. i assume.
 RocketCow#5210: I *am* the danger
 unityAccount#7810: *chuckles* I'm in trouble
 lilburlap#8480: Where I live anyways
 Scolon#4218: Yeah you haven't seen nothing yet
 Hobusu#5033: Yeah, this is the calm before the storm
 lilburlap#8480: This is why I always wear hoodie and sweatpants no matter the weather nobody makes fun of you for that
 wren#0640: wait til the jam starts lmao
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i think threads would work in tech help for engine specific stuff
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: as if we didn't already make a secret dm group where we judge everyone's fashion choices secretly while snickering
 unityAccount#7810: I don't think threads are too necessary as there are always 1-2 topics max being disxussed at all times here
 RocketCow#5210: the thread is never the thread is never the thread is never the thread
 Teslobo#8274: We've talked about allowing the creation and linking of external servers for the jam, with the disclaimer that we aren't responsible for whatever happens outside this server
 lilburlap#8480: That's called clothing
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Threads within threads
 Hobusu#5033: The thought of having threads on top of everything else made me shudder
 lilburlap#8480: Well guys it's time to open that group dm /j
 RocketCow#5210: that makes sense
 Teslobo#8274: Nay, you are confined to a limited number of text channels so we can watch them all
 DrNukeLear#2414: In the snow?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: can we make treads though?
 DrNukeLear#2414: Still here.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: That's not nice.
 DrNukeLear#2414: If you carry on, I swear I’ll apologise.
 Teslobo#8274: Disclaimer: don't.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Nah, I cant make threads
 wren#0640: test for if only patrons can threaten: seriously threaten another member and see if you get banned
 RocketCow#5210: thanks. So, threa*d*s
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Never make a typo again.
 Teslobo#8274: Or else
 DrNukeLear#2414: Don’t make a typo again.
 RocketCow#5210: remind me never to make a typo again
 Teslobo#8274: I can send you threats if you really want
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Yeah, only patrons can threaten.
 DrNukeLear#2414: It’s all good
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Ok.
 RocketCow#5210: I'm guessing threats are not available to non-patreons?
 Teslobo#8274: I don't mind because it presses me to do my job and watch the chat more
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: whether it's self defined or set by the game designer games tend to have a finalized objective. minecraft is a good example; you set yourself whatever goal you want in creative mode, while in survival the intended goal is, well, survival
 DrNukeLear#2414: Feel free to ping me as much as you like.
 Teslobo#8274: Not to my knowledge although I assume active participants in the conversation do not mind
 lilburlap#8480: Darn
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: No way to default it. Gotta unping manually everytime.
 lilburlap#8480: Is there a way to make your replies default to not pinging who you're replying to because I'm having a hard time remembering to do it every time?
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I'm currently reading The Art of Game Design.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: that's one of the reasons
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Games have an objective?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: the book the art of game design: a book of lenses tries to define a game but doesn't end up actually doing it. i remember it also defined that the minimum thing a game requires - interactivity - basically defines toys too, because toys are interactive but they aren't quite games for a few reasons
 RocketCow#5210: well, you could argue that there's always at least 2 parties: The player and the designer.
 lilburlap#8480: Oh ok that makes sense
 CALSYTHE#6648: parties means '1 or more parties'.
 lilburlap#8480: Ok that does make sense but I think it should just be changed to "1 or more parties"
 DrNukeLear#2414: Personally I’ve settled on the definition of: A series of *meaningful* decisions and opportunities. Where meaningfulness is defined by the decision or opportunity making a notable change in the state of the game.
 Teslobo#8274: The book "rules of play" mostly frames games like this too - a mutual agreement between parties to abide by limitations beyond the laws of state and reality
 Viola_Buddy#6763: Oh, that's a pretty good one. I think it captures the spirit of "game" better because the "unnecessary" part actually does feel significant to the feel of a game.
 CALSYTHE#6648: emotionally sad
 RocketCow#5210: the conflict is you vs. the human desire to build shelter
 CALSYTHE#6648: very sad
 wren#0640: the conflict is that there are no pretty houses built yet and that makes you sad
 CALSYTHE#6648: the conflict is your creativity
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: because by that definition, minecraft creative mode ain't a game
 CALSYTHE#6648: Gam Jam!
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: some definitions say that a game is defined by the fact that there is a conflict that needs to be resolved and i find that definition funny
 lilburlap#8480: I kinda like the definition that I saw in a mapcrow vid once "Willingly overcoming unnecessary obstacles"
 Viola_Buddy#6763: I think it's when you have at least one decision, at least one opponent (which can possibly be nature), and payoffs based on those decisions.
 Viola_Buddy#6763: Oh that note, game theory I'm pretty sure has a definition of game, which is pretty similar to the "interesting series of decisions" definition.
 RocketCow#5210: I mean, conway's life can be used a means of playing a game, but I wouldn't consider it a game as is.
 Viola_Buddy#6763: Yeah, to be fair, it really doesn't feel like a game at all. It just is called a "game"
 lilburlap#8480: Don't forget whatever happened to exploration
 Teslobo#8274: ~~except damage rolls~~
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i don't think so honestly. it's more of a mathematical simulation. at least if you don't consider versions that allow you to place squares yourself and try it out
 DrNukeLear#2414: I’d describe that as an algorithm.
 Viola_Buddy#6763: Wait the Conway Game of Life isn't a game then...
 DrNukeLear#2414: I actually prefer AEG’s roll and keep system, but it’s a close call.
 tykenn#8548: Oh, I was thinking the conway one
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i'm in the process of running a princess the hopeful (fanmade module for wod which is focused on magical girl stuff) and honestly storyteller might be my favorite system of like, all time. it's just so elegant in everything it does
 RocketCow#5210: ~~yes, released in 1960 by Milton-Bradley~~
 DrNukeLear#2414: A game is a series of interesting decisions.
A series of interesting decisions is not necessarily a game.
 M_Raven#4076: But I just play 5e because it’s currently the only system I know and the one the majority of my friends know
 Fraserfatt#1021: the ultimate game
 Teslobo#8274: Some patrons in this server are currently trying out exalted which is the same base system as world of darkness
 Viola_Buddy#6763: Wait, is IRL social interactions a game? If a game is a series of interesting decisions, is *life* a game?
 DrNukeLear#2414: The old stuff is amazing.
 RocketCow#5210: I think drawfee once played a TTRPG where the only rule was
"Whenever a player makes a statement about the world, that statement is now canon."
Which is hilariously chaotic.
 M_Raven#4076: I’ve been meaning to try World of Darkness TTRPGs
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: that's just a RP
 Teslobo#8274: Most developed social systems I've seen only put definitive locks on things players at the table aren't comfortable with, everything else remains in the realm of possibility
 RocketCow#5210: but then again, I could very well just play a TTRPG without any written rules, just go with the flow.
 tykenn#8548: I'm now making an entire video game based on an inspiring impromptu role playing session with no preparation. So sometimes the rules aren't even needed (granted, it was a quick one-shot, not a full campaign)
 wren#0640: more roleplay rules are generally only additions to what you can do during dialogue and not restrictions? at least thats what ive seen
 Teslobo#8274: That's generally only if the system is shit
 RocketCow#5210: Well, more rules for social engagements usually lead to more things you cannot do or say in said engagements.
 wren#0640: ooh my friend was gonna run that at some point
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: lightweight systems can be a lot of fun too honestly. love me a good monster of the week campaign
 Teslobo#8274: I'm not sure how one leads to the other there?
 RocketCow#5210: also yes, Milestones > XP
 RocketCow#5210: which I prefer. I don't like it when I roleplay and my DM goes "nah, you can't do that"
 wren#0640: combat xp being the only xp source RAW is horrible
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i think if you add untoggable autoplay, what you're essentially doing is removing an interactive element, which is a necessary part of games
 RocketCow#5210: I guess even an autoplay button is an addition that implements a reduction...
 Teslobo#8274: And then 70% of its rules and systems are combat related, and social engagements get next to nothing 🙂
 Viola_Buddy#6763: Hmm... but if you force autoplay, is that really an addition to the game, or is that at that point a subtraction?
 wren#0640: its not *un*fun but god it can drag
 wren#0640: combat is honestly the least fun part of dnd which kinda shows how its not amazing as a system
 Viola_Buddy#6763: So replace "button" with "forced autoplay"
 RocketCow#5210: but then, if you had *just* a button and the decision whether or not to click it, with no consequences, is that a game?
 BisectedBrioche#6824: Playing Pathfinder 2e after D&D 5e reminded me how clunky 3.5e D&D was
 Viola_Buddy#6763: Yeah, I was just thinking that
 wren#0640: the player still has to decide to click an autoplay button
 RocketCow#5210: 5e is great for new players, Pathfinder is great for parties with experience
 tykenn#8548: Oooh, blades int he dark is fun. I have to admit it's nice to play a system that goes quicker because combat doesn't drag on forever
 Jeker#3389: Oh alright
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i don't like DND 5e, it's a bit stiff. i prefer pathfinder a lot
 Viola_Buddy#6763: Hmm, but maybe if you add an "autoplay" button a game becomes a non-game
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: see that's interesting. because then you get into the concept of narrative and expected outcomes. can you trust the instruction manual? what if the game, TO YOU, personally, and not in any intended way, becomes not following the script as much as possible?
 Teslobo#8274: DnD is meticulously crafted to make sure I can't engage with the reason I would want to play a TTRPG, mainly a consequence of the way character creation works
 RocketCow#5210: I like DnD, I'm a basic b- person
 BisectedBrioche#6824: Personally, I like D&D, but I've had infinitely more fun running Blades in the Dark
 Viola_Buddy#6763: To some extent that's an RPG hints system
 Jeker#3389: Oh, nice! Take your time, i hope you guys wont feel rushed by people here asking
 wren#0640: i *realllly* wanna run a weaverdice campaign but its such an obscure ttrpg that no one will care lol
 lilburlap#8480: ^
 BisectedBrioche#6824: Many people find its market saturation trying. And the game itself a bit combat heavy
 RocketCow#5210: then you get stanley parable.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: what if the thing i add is a script to the side that says "hey, this choice here is the correct choice" everytime a choice comes up?
 wren#0640: dnd is fun to play but not that fun to run imo
 tykenn#8548: That reminds me my co-workers are trying to get a D&D campaign set in the world of our game and I'm supposed to make a character. I should probably do that soon.
 Jeker#3389: Why not DnD specifically? Lol
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: I'll discuss expanding the list with the team tomorrow morning 👍
 Viola_Buddy#6763: If you drop the grand story part, you end with basically 20 Questions, which I doubt anyone would deny is a game.
But I guess that does kind of lead to another question: if you have a game, and add other stuff to it, do you always get a game? Or can you add stuff to a game and end up with a non-game?
 Teslobo#8274: I am one of those people who will play a TTRPG so long as it isn't DnD
 lilburlap#8480: I have an open-ish (Random assortment of close friends) table for mausritter (Rpg about mice adventurers it's really cute)
 RocketCow#5210: I'm finally at a point in my life where TTRPGs are a regular thing for me. I DM a DnD game, I play in another DnD game and a pathfinder game. Life is good.
 AquaduckStudio#0780: i think teamfinder should include "Creative Director" to the list of skills. Sometimes you just want a madlad who can throw 1000 new ideas at you even though they can't actually do anything in unity or blender or photoshop
 Jeker#3389: (I mean it was a joke lol) Can you please add scratch? :))
 wren#0640: starfinders like pathfinder but space right
 wren#0640: i should find a new ttrpg group
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: got a pod ready to play starfinder tomorrow :]
 wren#0640: god i miss dnd
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: You can just ask 😇
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: yup. What i just descriped is just a very very simplified ttrpg
 RocketCow#5210: That's basically DnD 😛
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: i just think it’s impossible to point to a ‘correct’ definition, but it can be fun to try
 davidnjihiahere#6326: yeah, like I feel like love2d people, monogame people, pygame, renpy. I feel like many are missing
 wren#0640: definitely
 Jeker#3389: Lets bully the teamfinder team to add scratch
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: for example. is some guy telling you about this grand story and then asking you yes or no questions about how the story will go, a game?
 Tex B.#4484: Hahaha
 RocketCow#5210: ooooh, yeah, I misunderstood that completely then.
 lilburlap#8480: Agreed
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: no i live for it, i was trying to spice it up
 Jeker#3389: I agree
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: definitions are useful insofar as they are descriptors and also taking them to the very limits
 Teslobo#8274: Scratch when
 AquaduckStudio#0780: i just posted on team finder 😄
 RocketCow#5210: It seemed to me like you were trying to shut down the discussion, sorry if that was a false impression
 davidnjihiahere#6326: TIC-80, personally
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: I’m not against the discussion Rocket, what gave you that idea
 RocketCow#5210: Team finder is the dark souls of collaboration.
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: What ones would you add?
 Viola_Buddy#6763: ~~Is Team Finder a game?~~
 RocketCow#5210: like yes, you won't change any minds with a discussion like this, but you exchange ideas, and what you pick up from other's perspectives can always be useful in the future.
 Tex B.#4484: And in a discussion filled with game designers, it is interesting to see what Devs think is a game, and what isn't on the table
 davidnjihiahere#6326: Team finder is really good but it has very few engines
 wren#0640: i think all something needs to be classed as a game is progression with player input, even if its just a next dialogue button
 Viola_Buddy#6763: I don't think it's necessarily useless. Well, the definition itself, probably, but the discussion around it lets you think about aspects of games, what does and doesn't unify them, trends, things like that
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: lmao
 RocketCow#5210: the exchange of ideas and reasoning behind said ideas is always a worthwhile endeavour, if you ask me.
 Teslobo#8274: Rampant prescriptivism is enjoyable
 Fraserfatt#1021: a game of patience
 Tex B.#4484: I agree, but it is fun to explore
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: Is programming a game?
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: you guys are still on definition? come on, they’re useless
 Tex B.#4484: There are competitions, with people who win more than statistically average. It relies on learning your opponent over several rounds
 Viola_Buddy#6763: Oh, are visual novels (the kind with no choice other than, like, save and quit) not games under this definition?
 RocketCow#5210: you can't throw thousands of game making nerds into a discord server and expect it *not* to come up, let's be real.
 Teslobo#8274: Based
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: oh my god are people having this argument here too? i argued about this during the brackeys jam for like an hour
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: and conversely, when you play poker, you play poker, you do have a lot of decisions to make; just happens that money is on the line
 Teslobo#8274: Is there truly a decision being made
 Teslobo#8274: The decisions matter as far as the outcome is concerned but there's no information to base the decision on and whether it succeeds is more or less random.
 RocketCow#5210: I wouldn't consider slots a game, the same way I wouldn't consider *just* rolling a dice a game.
 flameguy21#8407: anything can be a bucket if you're brave enough
 Tex B.#4484: This is getting out of hand
 tykenn#8548: Is a game a bucket?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: if you go by sidmeirs definition of what a game is, what interesting decisions do you do when you play a slot machine?
 Fraserfatt#1021: let the theme of this jam be gambling games 😂
 wren#0640: fps's arent games you just click on heads, discuss
 Viola_Buddy#6763: Is the card game War then not a game?
 RocketCow#5210: what bark said
 Tex B.#4484: Sure you make decisions, and they do matter
 RocketCow#5210: I read that in the voice of Kevan Brighting and it just fits.
 Viola_Buddy#6763: Oh are we discussing the limits of what counts as a "game"? Ooh what about something like rock-paper-scissors? Is that a game?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i mean, there are very two different types of gambling, slot machines, which were made to be addictive unwinnable machines (look it up, they were designed to be addictive) and stuff like poker, which is a game with gambling tacked onto it
 Tex B.#4484: You have to explain yourself
 wren#0640: the gambling actually makes the game more of a game, and the more gambling in a game the more game it is
 RocketCow#5210: yeah no, you're right
 RocketCow#5210: I see what you mean, yes
 Teslobo#8274: The betting of chips is, but you put in money to buy in separately
 Tex B.#4484: I know, but you can bet without money being involved. Video games use meaningless scores all the time
 RocketCow#5210: how much you bet, when to fold to conserve your resources, that's all poker
 wren#0640: i think that any interactive media that decides to call itself a game is a game
 RocketCow#5210: *although* now that I think about it, the betting part of poker *is* part of the game, no?
 RocketCow#5210: that's a fair point
 Teslobo#8274: I think what separates going to the shop from gambling is that your decisions in the activity "going to the shop" are based on outcomes outside the activity. With something like poker the motivators of your actions during gameplay are more isolated to the game. A bad hand is a bad hand no matter how much money is riding on it etc, and a good bluff is a good bluff.
 Tex B.#4484: Id say what Nuke said, there is a card game, and an attached gambling element
 RocketCow#5210: I will agree that something like slots isn't a game
 Tex B.#4484: Compelling point
 RocketCow#5210: you would say that poker isn't a game?
 Tex B.#4484: Yeah, all definitions fall apart eventually
 DrNukeLear#2414: The games are games, the gambling on the outcome of the game is the gambling.
 RocketCow#5210: I mean, that deffinition would also exclude any game that has some form of agenda, quality of said agenda aside. Games that try to raise awareness would be automatically excluded from their status as games, no?
 flameguy21#8407: Does tic tac toe count as gambling?
 Tex B.#4484: Gambling games aren't games in my opinion
 Tex B.#4484: I mean, Id say no
 tykenn#8548: So gambling games don't count?
 RocketCow#5210: That's true, didn't think of those
 Teslobo#8274: I think Gone Home and its ilk are the more popular targets of that argument
 Tex B.#4484: Some say that in order for it to be a game it has to serve no clear purpose aside from play
 Fraserfatt#1021: simulators can be interesting
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: this is because art is subjective, and if the point of a game is to be a series of "interesting decisions", then the subjective part of making a game is what you think is interesting
 tykenn#8548: even self-playing games count then because you're experiencing a series of interesting decisions of a bot vicariously
 RocketCow#5210: "Farming simulator isn't a game"
The argument exists already.
 DrNukeLear#2414: Only if a series of interesting decisions is a game, which is not necessarily true.
 Teslobo#8274: Until you argue over what qualifies as interesting
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: a trip to the shops could be a game, why not
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: that's a good definition
 Tex B.#4484: Well then so is a trip to the shops
 DrNukeLear#2414: The Sid Meier definition is that a game is “a series of interesting decisions”
 Tex B.#4484: And game jams do have a lose condition, where your computer crashes and you give up
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: throwing out the stuff i learned from game design lenses
 Tex B.#4484: Fair point
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: does a game need a win condition? is tetris a game if it doesn't have a win con?
 Tex B.#4484: A game jam is a game, provided there is a win condition
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: *makes jam for the game jam.*
 RocketCow#5210: I mean, when you think about it, a game jam is kind of a game itself. A game about making games.
 DrNukeLear#2414: Surely that would be a game jam game game jam?
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: damn.
 Hobusu#5033: A game jam about making game jams
 Hobusu#5033: I'm now thinking about if both instances of 'Jam' in that meant 'game jam', it reminds me of the concept of exploding dice in some tabletop games
 M_Raven#4076: Jam Jam, you have 2 days to make the best jam
 flameguy21#8407: game pb&j
 BurnV06#5857: Reject game jam, return to game peanut butter
 Jeker#3389: Oh then as a scrippting language C++ is prerty unecessary
 nekiwo#7574: assuming that the engine is already created
 nekiwo#7574: i meant like making games
 Jeker#3389: (I.e, computer graphics, low level stuff, ect)
 Jeker#3389: C++'s performance is really useful for some cases
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: no
 nekiwo#7574: im sure 90% of the time, especially on a game jam, the performance of C++ is unnecessary
 CALSYTHE#6648: Does anyone need more JAM?
 Jeker#3389: Hey, uh to give a less biased look (I have used C++ for big projects, including a pretty advanced text editor and a level editor) C++ is generally faster, but the uses for that speed are getting less and less, as computers are becominh faster, and even C# is getting faster itself. C++ is also more dangerous than C# and can be difficult to trace errors with, however it has some really nice features, such as templates
 BurnV06#5857: Flipping individual bits by hand
 wren#0640: ive considered learning rust for software dev it seems cool
 Viola_Buddy#6763: Assembly or bust
*insert relevant XKCD*
 M_Raven#4076: Punch cards
 BurnV06#5857: Someone should make a game in FORTRAN just for the hell of it
 M_Raven#4076: I just like Rust just because it’s a language I understand better
 Capt#4328: Lol
 Jeker#3389: No, generally speaking
 Viola_Buddy#6763: It's probably better in theory but it's a bigger pain to deal with in practice.
Well, probably. I'm highly biased though because I'm less experienced in C++ than I am in C#. 
 Capt#4328: Rust for game dev?
 Jeker#3389: Contriversal opinion, but I kinda like C++ more than Rust
 DrNukeLear#2414: I second this opinion
 Jeker#3389: Kinda agree
 BurnV06#5857: C# is best for video games imho
 Capt#4328: But I like C# better because I feel like I can get a lot done in a short amount of time
 Jeker#3389: Yeah, I mostly use C++ for desktop applications, and i am commenting on general features of the languages tho, like smart pointers rather than its uses
 BurnV06#5857: Yes, you can do pretty good stuff with it, problem is it’s difficult and tedious to get it to do anything advanced
 Capt#4328: I'm surprised to hear this take.  Almost everyone I talk to says C++ is the best language for game dev because of the performance
 Viola_Buddy#6763: I always say that C++ has all the problems of C and also all the problems of Java or C#.
Like, it has a lot of the good parts of both, which is the whole point, but it also definitely means you have to deal with the problems of both.
 Jeker#3389: Search up dafluffypotato on youtube
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: different languages for different applications. i think raw c++ is probably too much for game dev
 BurnV06#5857: Python’s good for everything but video games
 Jeker#3389: Oh, my bad
 jake_is_the_Coolest#6715: lol, tru
 Jeker#3389: Depends
 Selviam#7268: i really love this chat im gonna miss it once jams r over
 wren#0640: so it used both
 jake_is_the_Coolest#6715: I agree, C++ is *worse* than python
 wren#0640: from the official tumblr:
FNA and MonoGame are ports of XNA, and we use them to build the game cross-platform . We could cut out XNA entirely and just use FNA for PC versions, but haven’t felt the need to yet.
 BurnV06#5857: Imho unreal works better for big-budget triple a games than small indie projects
 jake_is_the_Coolest#6715: lol
 Jeker#3389: C++ has some funky features
 DeltaRail#4639: ok stop
 jake_is_the_Coolest#6715: 
 DeltaRail#4639: 
 M_Raven#4076: This is so unreal
 jake_is_the_Coolest#6715: 
 Adrian Agren#9299: MY BRAIN!! There are so many different ways and engines to make games with, I will stick with unity until I can’t 😂😂
 Jeker#3389: Celeste used XNA which MonoGame is heavily inspired by
 Fraserfatt#1021: same, except with using unreal. I'm too comfy in unity to do unreal for a game jam still
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: love2D is awesome, not my speed though
 Jeker#3389: MonoGame i've also tried, i even did my own getPixel() function, cause there wasent one lol
 wren#0640: iirc celeste used it for its console releases?
 M_Raven#4076: Just use the source engine ez
 wren#0640: monogame's interesting too
 Jeker#3389: Fair, its the framework i used to make an engine once
 Adrian Agren#9299: I have heard about that but I am too comfortable with Unity and C#
 Jeker#3389: Love2D doesent get enough attention imo
 Fraserfatt#1021: ye, Lua for its scripting stuff. I'm very unfamiliar 😅
 NoelJasik#8768: yes
 Fraserfatt#1021: I'll prob end up using unity
 Adrian Agren#9299: Roblox uses Lua right?
 Fraserfatt#1021: darn, my plans are foiled lmao
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i still need to play yume nikki but i gotta respect the OG
 Jeker#3389: Oh, yeah yume nikki is also pretty impressive imo
 BurnV06#5857: I think it says that you can’t use Roblox in the rules
 Fraserfatt#1021: there's some crazy stuff people make in it, it's got the capability for sure. Though reading the documentation hurts my brain
 wren#0640: ive only played the original
 wren#0640: i need to play some of the fan made yume nikki sequels
 Jeker#3389: Eh, sure but you should use a library like SDL not pure OpenGL imo
 NoelJasik#8768: Roblox is quite powerfull actually, just that roblox company sucks
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i'm more thinking about the classics of rpg maker stuff. stuff like yume nikki, ib, etc.
 wren#0640: makes sense why it took just under a decade
 wren#0640: omoris use of rpgmaker is genuinely insane
 Adrian Agren#9299: Yeah, I want to try it but I am scared 😂
 Fraserfatt#1021: time to do this game jam in roblox
 Jeker#3389: Ofcs it does, have you seen Omori?
 NoelJasik#8768: The game engine i made isn't
 M_Raven#4076: Game engine jam
 lilburlap#8480: That sounds very daunting
 M_Raven#4076: Based opinion
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: this BETTER include rpg maker
 hal#0125: pain
 Adrian Agren#9299: There is always the option to learn C++ and make your own engine 😁
 Jeker#3389: All modern engines are equally powerful, fight me
 M_Raven#4076: I started with Godot and ended up switching my for that reason
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: my game design class from next semester is going to be in unity and that's fine! probably going to have transferable skills anyways
 Fraserfatt#1021: a lotta schools offer that unity. It's not bad but it can get complex with weird engine things
 M_Raven#4076: Godot is very good, but the course my school offered is in Unity
 Adrian Agren#9299: I usually watch some tutorials and then I screw around and try my own “theories”
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: the godot docs are built in such a way that in 3 hours you can built a very basic game to give you some idea of how the engine is supposed to work and its strengths in modularity
 Tex B.#4484: My first engine was Godot and it has always served me well
 wren#0640: the godot docs are quite good honestly
 lilburlap#8480: Best way to learn imo
 Adrian Agren#9299: Yeah I would suggest Unity as that was the first game engine I went into after doing some scratch but I haven’t used any other engines so I don’t know
 BurnV06#5857: Yeah. To learn GMS2, I didn’t use tutorials, I just screwed around and built a game on my own while occasionally referencing the official documentation
 Tex B.#4484: Yeah unity may have more outside suport, but Godot has better documentation
 lilburlap#8480: Oh yeah I remember how hard it was for middle school me to learn scratch before it just clicked
 Fraserfatt#1021: Took me a number of tries to get into Unreal. All engines take some time to get used to (Especially if you're used to different workflows)
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: or honestly, the godot tutorials in the docs themselves
 wren#0640: i wouldnt really say that python is any more like scratch than any other language? apart from having closer to spoken word syntax
 PepperBoi#4544: Yeah multiple excellent tutorials
 Tex B.#4484: Heartbeast has an excellent Godot tutorial on YouTube
 NoelJasik#8768: I attempted to use unity like 4 times before i started getting a grasp of it, don't worry just try
 BurnV06#5857: It’s just not very user-friendly. There’s no real workspace or built-in assets/high level functions, it’s all just code.
 lilburlap#8480: So it's inferior
 lilburlap#8480: I think I'll try godot again sometime soon I tried a while ago and didn't really wrap my head around it but I was only trying for like 30 minutes when I was 12
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: noice
 Adrian Agren#9299: Depends on what you compare it to 😂
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I like pygame
 Adrian Agren#9299: Python is like scratch but without blocks
 BurnV06#5857: Pygame is not the best to say the least
 NoelJasik#8768: i did C# after scratch
 BurnV06#5857: Same
 wren#0640: well theres pygame
 Adrian Agren#9299: After using scratch, the first “real” programming language I tried was Python (which is very good for beginners in imo) but that wasn’t for games
 BurnV06#5857: Yeah I’d say Godot or GMS2 would be a good stepping stone from scratch
 lilburlap#8480: It was, I do not have very good luck or judgement when trying new things
 wren#0640: i feel like tic-80 would be a bit jumping into the deep end coming straight from scratch lol
 lilburlap#8480: I tried TIC-80 for a little bit but I had a hard time getting used to it
 Fraserfatt#1021: where there's a will, there is a way
 wren#0640: a fantasy computer similar to pico-8
 lilburlap#8480: Look polished is a very subjective term... (It's really finnicky but if you spend enough time you can make something clean)
 Adrian Agren#9299: What is tic-80?
 Adrian Agren#9299: Yea, you never HAVE to stay with a game engine but if you feel comfortable, who is to say you need to change
 cathy#3897: is it possible to get polished games done on scratch?
 wren#0640: ill probably go with godot bc thats what im used to but im considering trying pico-8 or tic-80
 lilburlap#8480: scratch ofc
 NoelJasik#8768: neat
 wren#0640: im still torn on what to use for this jam tbh
 NoelJasik#8768: yeah i agree, i am more talking about peapole who act like once you pick a game engine, you have to stay using it forever, a lot of peapole are like that
 lilburlap#8480: It's a little wonky like how the outline of the enemies flashes white along with them because it's the one sprite with a transparent background
 Adrian Agren#9299: Of course! But I think we both agree on that changing your engine doesn’t matter and I personally think everyone should try multiple engines to find what fits you best
 NoelJasik#8768: depends on how quickly you learn
 NoelJasik#8768: Tbh scratch is a bit of a extreme example, this way more applies to like unreal to unity, or godot to unreal, but still, the way you have to think as a programmer is exacly the same no matter the tool, yes it's not instant, but if you are already good with one engine, it shouldn't take more than a month to switch
 Adrian Agren#9299: I mean if you take Scratch vs Unity for example. First of all you need to learn how to code (as Scratch is visual) and unity is not and you have to learn all the different ui around Unity. It is not difficult if you have the time, but most people have work or school and thus does not have the time
 lilburlap#8480: Yeah it's super helpful
 NoelJasik#8768: cool
 wren#0640: oh neat
 lilburlap#8480: I use a website, Forkphorus
 wren#0640: can you export scratch as html or as exe?
 NoelJasik#8768: it's not as difficulty as it seems to change a programming language
 lilburlap#8480: I just switch devices a lot so I had to build a web only workflow
 NoelJasik#8768: Tbh, most game engines and programming languages nowdays do the same stuff, but have a bit diffrent syntaxes/ui
 Adrian Agren#9299: Same, but the difficulty part is that you most of the time have to learn a new system and some times even a new language which could be a problem for many
 lilburlap#8480: I'm 80% sure griffpatch's already working on that
 wren#0640: im sure thats been done
 BurnV06#5857: Someone needs to make DOOM in scratch
 Adrian Agren#9299: Alright, good luck!
 lilburlap#8480: Nice
 NoelJasik#8768: Tbh, there's nothing bad in trying out new stuff, i feel like peapole should start to be less attached to game engines than they are now, nothing wrong with your choice though
 BurnV06#5857: I remember when I was in grade 6, there was this end-of-year event where you had to make a creative thing. Me and all my close friends made video games. I ended up having to do part-time duty as an IT guy because I had way more experience and had to solve everyone else’s bugs lol
 lilburlap#8480: Not very functional in real time but yeah you can make mazes and stuff with that
 lilburlap#8480: I don't want to switch I've become too dependant on it
 RocketCow#5210: People have build entire raycasting engines in scratch
 lilburlap#8480: I use a website called forkphorus which removes the edge barriers (Allowing objects to move beyond the borders of the screen) to convert it to html which helps a lot
 Adrian Agren#9299: Haha I could see that. Are you new to game development and are using Scratch because of that or don’t you just want to switch
 birdstone#3073: like you could move around in 3d
 birdstone#3073: i knew a person in my school that somehow rendered a cube in scratch
 NoelJasik#8768: Yeah it's pretty hard to use scratch for anything complex
 lilburlap#8480: Oh believe me it's an intense experience trying to force scratch to make a game that isn't a simple platformer/top-down
 Adrian Agren#9299: Ok, then I’ll stick to unity 😁
 Adrian Agren#9299: Well thought, could be chaotic lol
 lilburlap#8480: Everyone needs to make their game in scratch now it's the rules /j
 BurnV06#5857: It’s good for beginners, not for advanced stuff tho
 RocketCow#5210: This year's theme: Ooops all scratch
 lilburlap#8480: It's definitely not made for anything serious, seeing as it's an education tool, but I got too used to it and I'm not switching to anything else right before the jam
 Adrian Agren#9299: I haven’t tried that, is it good?
 BurnV06#5857: I haven’t used that since last game jam. I use GMS2 nowadays
 Adrian Agren#9299: Oh wow, I haven’t used that in years. Is it still being used 😂
 sennoide#1339: always fun right?
 lilburlap#8480: ...Scratch
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: oh boy sweeping generalities time
 Adrian Agren#9299: Cool, are you a fellow Unity user or do you use something else?
 BurnV06#5857: Reminds me of a rule of thumb I figured out from my several vacations to Mexico: the farther south, the more of a tropical paradise it is. The farther north, the more crime and poverty and stuff like that
 lilburlap#8480: Yep
 MangoWorks#1202: at least for me'
 MangoWorks#1202: the the jam i found that uses the theme combined ends at 3:00am on july 17th
 MangoWorks#1202: oh crap
 birdstone#3073: i didn't need to read that lmao
 Adrian Agren#9299: Are you going to join the game jam?
 Jeker#3389: I can barely do one
 MangoWorks#1202: like the Godot NSFW Jam
 BurnV06#5857: I know I was just saying that would be funny
 MangoWorks#1202: also some jams are just impossible
 Jeker#3389: Still a lot
 MangoWorks#1202: im only doing 5
 BurnV06#5857: Imagine participating in every active itch.io jam with one game
 Teslobo#8274: How many combine harvester games will be produced I wonder
 Adrian Agren#9299: Of course, there is no guarantee no one is getting offended by it tho
 lilburlap#8480: We don't talk about texas why do you think we're the furthest you can be while still being connected to the main mass /j
 Jeker#3389: Oh hey guys look its the Irish people stereotype:
 sennoide#1339: that's stereopypical enough, i guess
 MangoWorks#1202: there's a jam im doing with 4 other jams including GMTK Jam 2022 and the theme for the jam is: "Combine" So i don't even have to do anything
 Loulor#5705:  Wierdly, her/his name just drop, so maybe she/he create an ccount between my request 😄 Sorry for bother you, have a nice week !
 NoelJasik#8768: I know, but as long as it's all fun and games, it isn't that bad
 sennoide#1339: i've literally made a song with something along those lines
 NoelJasik#8768: Come to brazil
 Adrian Agren#9299: Well, what I mean is that they don’t define anyone. You can be whoever you want to and therefore are stereotypes often times false
 sennoide#1339: i'm not even going to ask what the stereotype for brazilians is haha
 BurnV06#5857: I went to Michigan yesterday
 lilburlap#8480: Old man with big beard ig I'm not very sure? /j
 NoelJasik#8768: you dislike turk
 Jeker#3389: Whats the stereotype for Greek people?
 NoelJasik#8768: i dunno what stereotype is from there, i just know there's texas
 Loulor#5705: Everything is alright, i mean that is @ is  and it say . I can guess the user ins't on discord, but can i have his/her mail or something to DM it ? (I really want to contact this person because it's the firts, who answer my post)
 lilburlap#8480: Alive, well, and content
 BurnV06#5857: Yes
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: i'm fine, little tired, it's late here.
 NoelJasik#8768: for me and  they are lol
 lilburlap#8480: Michigan
 Adrian Agren#9299: I am doing really good! Wbu?
 Jeker#3389: Decent, you?
 lilburlap#8480: Yeah I have not heard the best stories about american tourists, which sorta contributed to me not liking travel
 Adrian Agren#9299: Why even talk about stereotypes, their almost never correct
 NoelJasik#8768: depends which state we talking about
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: How's everyone doing?
 Jeker#3389: Oh, i am sure you are, especially from American tourists
 Wokarol#0940: Both is also hella hard to achieve
 BurnV06#5857: Yeah, America has some kinda crappy stereotypes. I’ve been there though and it seems like a nice place
 BurnV06#5857: He’s my profile picture
 Adrian Agren#9299: Hello!
 Jeker#3389: Lets see how many people dont understand i am joking
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: haha yeah - I was also shocked abt that when I was born
 lilburlap#8480: I really hope I'm far from the U.S. Stereotypes
 NoelJasik#8768: yeah it is
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: good evening :D
 NoelJasik#8768: well tbh i don't like football all that much, so i guess i am not the perfect sterotype
 Jeker#3389: Hmmm you see i was in Englad for 2 weeks, and I got shellshocked when i learned british people exist
 BurnV06#5857: I’m a diehard hockey fan who tries his hardest to be polite, likes Tim Hortons and maple syrup and I have a labrador retriever which I think I heard might be a Canadian stereotype I’m not sure
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: idk lol
 NoelJasik#8768: I am also a pretty sterotypical polish person
 Jeker#3389: Are Irish people real?
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: hi
 Adrian Agren#9299: I’m from Sweden baby 😎😎
 DrNukeLear#2414: Hi from Wales!
 lilburlap#8480: It's pretty similar to learning other art mediums so yeah I'd call it art
 Jeker#3389: I did software development and low level stuff for the most part
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Yeah I think they support what I do, but also think its a bit sad 😄
 Jeker#3389: I actually recently got into game dev
 Adrian Agren#9299: Ok then, I would think that as long as you do your school related work your parents won’t be dissatisfied with you making videos or games on your spare time, right?
 BurnV06#5857: I was gonna reply saying I don’t like something quintessentially Canadian, but then I realized I am literally the most stereotypical Canadian ever lmao
 dardasaba#9759: Also, , sad to hear that your parents aren't supportive of what you do, mine were really happy and proud when I showed them the games I made
I really don't understand the parents who discourage their kids from doing what they love 
 NoelJasik#8768: Game dev and a lot of stuff programming related is art, fight me
 Jeker#3389: Like, when i was young they really wanted me to pursue art/photography but i never really liked it, and i got more intrested on how computers work and stuff, like programming, which was kinda passable in their eyes
 NoelJasik#8768: i guess it's diffrent there
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Also just saying I don't like tea
 BurnV06#5857: I live in Canada
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: England
 NoelJasik#8768: Where do you live? i am 17 and going to 3rd year of highschool
 redka#6365: we're the big team
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: I'm in england, so we all go to college after high school
 NoelJasik#8768: yeah i know, this was a hyperbole
 Adrian Agren#9299: Ok, and do your parents want you to go to collage?
 dardasaba#9759: I mean I assume all (or most) of the moderators are adults
 lilburlap#8480: Probably more that aren't active in the chat
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Well just left high school
 Jeker#3389: If you reefer to me, i start high school this september lol
 BurnV06#5857: Yeah Imma be in grade 10 next year
 NoelJasik#8768: i think there's like 2 peapole who aren't in highschool or lower here lol
 Adrian Agren#9299: And you are in school I would assume?
 Jeker#3389: I mean, my parents really push me to do something creative, and less focused on the logic side of things, which can be kind off demorilizing if i am being honest
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: 16
 Adrian Agren#9299: How old are you if I may ask?
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: They don't mind me programming, so yeah I can just say that
 NoelJasik#8768: nope
 NoelJasik#8768: Do they look down on programming in general? just say it's programming
 Adrian Agren#9299: Will there be a way to vote for the theme of the game jam?
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: nope
 DrNukeLear#2414: Would making minecraft videos be more acceptable in their eyes?
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: I'm not ashamed lol. I'll try it
 NoelJasik#8768: Don't be ashamed of your past actions, just do it
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: I was going to
 Nobody6502#8971: Just one I prefer
 DrNukeLear#2414: My son watched an ep or two I think lol
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Plus they kinda look down on making video games, so I can't really say thats what I'm making the video for
 Jeker#3389: Why not make a different google account?
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Yeah 😄
 DrNukeLear#2414: Same display pic? 🙂
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: I last posted like half a year or a year ago
 DrNukeLear#2414: How long ago did you run this channel?
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: Hi . sorry for the delayed response - busy night! - do you mean you can't send DMs to this person?
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: I don't mind sharing my voice, its complicated. Basically I used to run a cringy Minecraft channel that my parents knew about. This means if they hear me recording a video they think I've gone back to it
 Jeker#3389: Hallo
 Hannes#5054: Hi! :D
 DrNukeLear#2414: Just a tip, record your voice at the same time as the video but as a separate sound file. That way you can opt to include it or not while still practicing.
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Oki 🙂
 theChief#0001: The important thing about devlogs is that they're either entertaining or informative. The most successful ones are both!
 theChief#0001: You can use TTS or just some text boxes with background music ☺️
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: I want to make videos of my game dev, but I can't really use my voice lol
 NoelJasik#8768: i mean it matters, but you can get away with more
 NoelJasik#8768: but i would have to do comedy, cuz there quality doesn't matter that much
 NoelJasik#8768: i mean i did voice overs for my youtube videos like a year ago, got better with my speech since than so it wouldn't be that bad
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: if you never do anything bad you don't know what to avoid. and the process of analyzing what went wrong with something is insanely useful to get better at that thing
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: anything is bad when you just start out, and that's a part of the process
 NoelJasik#8768: Will probably be pretty bad lol
 NoelJasik#8768: i never did VA though lol, but would be fun to give it a shot
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: god this reminds me of like ads from the 90s about how making games is actually this super easy thing and that it's basically playing all day while eating chips and going "yeah i think the jump should be higher or something lol" and nothing else
 NoelJasik#8768: I can do VA, i can do a strong slavic accent, or a not so strong slavic accent
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: you get to make funny voices and people pay you! what's better? (< completely aware that the work needed to do VA is actually insane and requires a lot of practice)
 DrNukeLear#2414: It’s good fun.
 BadPiggy#5202: I'd honestly love to do some voice acting tbh.
But I'd just sound like a pig
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: ya never know, maybe a big team could use some VA if they have the time
 BadPiggy#5202: On the other hand ......
I can't think of anything else which would really make your game stand out lol
 BadPiggy#5202: Unfortunately though, I could probably count on my hand the number of game jam games which had VA in them :/
 redka#6365: i checked yt and yes it appears so
 DrNukeLear#2414: ^ He’s good
 Mr. Alias#1323: Hi everyone! Looking for a team to offer my Voice acting!
I've done VO for games and run a small animation channel.
Please DM me!
 Martin111#0333: oh damn
that sounds ambitious 
 redka#6365: colored light
 Martin111#0333: aye
But also is the lighting done via lasers or just coloured light?
spilling out of the cubes
 redka#6365: also the idea is that if, say, you use a red light cube, but the optic scanner passes a blue glass sheet, the result will be purple
 redka#6365: behavior changes could be cool, but for now they just refract light differently
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: do the differently colored cubes work in different ways? like, does the blue cube slide while the yellow one bounces more? cool idea btw!
 Martin111#0333: Almost portal like aesthetic, cool
The idea itself is neat
 birdstone#3073: oh god the physics
 redka#6365: it's a cool idea for a practice run, and we might take it further
 redka#6365: each cube refracts light differently, producing different hues
 redka#6365: We have a really cool game idea but we'll keep it outside of the jam fully (Telling you what the idea is so you know we didn't use it)
Basically the idea is that you use a photon cannon to temporarily power-up cubes with light, and you can register the color of the light with optic scanners 
 BadPiggy#5202: Basically in simple words,
Just like how you'd not be allowed to take chits of paper with answers into an exam hall....
You can't really start working on your entry right now
 nekiwo#7574: ah thats fine 👍
cant wait to see what you make, make sure to message!
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: yeah because i dont think they can really do something about you wanting to learn how to do something before the jam, and then Maybe that might apply so you use that knowledge on brand new, just made code
 birdstone#3073: i think it's fine to "practice" working with your team before the jam but not actually prepare anything that you'll use when the jam itself starts
 redka#6365: ah, so we can solve problems in a practice way, but not really re-use the code we used to solve them?
 birdstone#3073: by own engine do you mean you made your own engine or just the one you prefer
 Nobody6502#8971: Unfortunately I’ve been pretty set on my own engine n stuff for like a month lol (not sure why the reply failed the first time)
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: honestly i'm super proud of what i made in my last jam so i really can't wait to see what i'll make this time. maybe the smaller amount of time will produce something even better
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: maybe lore continuity stuff? nintendo is not like. very consistent with zelda games
 Viola_Buddy#6763: BotW doesn't, which is why there was some amount of "wait but why is he still right-handed?" discussion at the original reveal of the game.
 birdstone#3073: lmao i could say the same with me and aminus
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I've worked on way better games since Quantum Love.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: considering those games (at least ss, not sure abot botw) have motion controls, that makes sense
 BurnV06#5857: If you make a game for this game jam, you will DIE! ...in a few decades due to old age. You’ll die if you don’t make a game too.
 nekiwo#7574: hiii
you wanna join our team?
 birdstone#3073: hello mr. quantum love
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I just notice the other people I've jammed with before. Lol.
 birdstone#3073: there's a lot of people here i recognize from past jams, i'm thinking of becoming a patron this year
 Nobody6502#8971: I’ve recognized people from non game dev circles too which is neat
 Viola_Buddy#6763: Yes, but TP Link in particular is canonically left-handed. (SS Link and BotW Link are canonically right-handed, and I think that might be it)
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: You got folks from GDN, GDL, Brackeys, Unity and some locals from GMTK as well. It's neat af!
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i'm not Sure but i believe this is at least the reason for twilight princess on wii being a mirror version
 BurnV06#5857: That took ages to send
 BurnV06#5857: Wouldn’t different links have different dominant hands? Or is that a constant with all links like the green clothes and name “Link”
 birdstone#3073: some from the tip of the iceberg some from the darkest corners
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: I'm prepared for the dire consequences of making my masterpiece videogame "Platformer 100: I will never learn how to finetune jumping" because i care about the art so much
 Nobody6502#8971:  Dang you’re everywhere lol
 Viola_Buddy#6763: I can nigh guarantee that if your game isn't good enough, a child will die.
~~That said, if your game *is* good enough, a child will still die too. Your game unfortunately will not solve childhood mortality. ~~
 birdstone#3073: TRUE
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: We're creating the future. Fym?
 birdstone#3073: on the other hand, your game can solve world hunger
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: if your game isn't good enough, a child might die.
 birdstone#3073: yes everyone our futures are in the hands of this jams results
 Luke DJ#3735: awesome, thanks for the insight! :)
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: we NEED to be prepared for the dire results this  game jam will have for the sociopolitical landscape of an already fractured world
 birdstone#3073: man i love talking about the game jam
 theChief#0001: You can update your page even after the jam ends. Edit game -> more -> admins
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i think this is a feature in the submission process?
 Luke DJ#3735: wonderful, cheers! 😁
 theChief#0001: Yep! 😁
 birdstone#3073: fair fair lmao
 Luke DJ#3735: howdy! just a quick one (sorry if this is the wrong channel), does anyone know if contributors can be added to a game's itch.io page after the jam's already started? haven't used itch.io since the 2020 one & can't remember how it worked
 wren#0640: stay far away from the terf isles
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: what are you talking about. Normal Island is Normal
 theChief#0001: No no no this is hell island stay away I beg you 😂
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: here is the new president king's remarks upon finding out he won: "fank you much. i own nintendo now"
 birdstone#3073: im moving to the uk
 theChief#0001: Yeah that broadly sums it up tbh
 birdstone#3073: that reminds me  the only thing i know about uk politics was boris johnson talking about peppa pig world in a business conference or something
 theChief#0001: Jimmy's policies largely revolve around fortnite and scrapping the oppressive screen time parental control feature of his iPhone
 birdstone#3073: jimmy is a great leader
 wren#0640: deserved
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: in a shocker result we regret to inform you that Jimmy, 12, has won the electoral game jam, with his game called "my first patformer please rate 5 star"
 birdstone#3073: we are making history here
 theChief#0001: Anything is better than first past the post, I'd vote for this
 birdstone#3073: this
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: elections are played out just have everyone ever partecipate in a game jam and whoever wins gains control of the government
 wren#0640: honestly if capital by marx was an indie platformer i feel like more people wouldve read it
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: That's what game Jams are for!
 Scolon#4218: Game Jams!!!!!!
 birdstone#3073: or maybe its an oh yesssss idk i know nothing of the uk
 theChief#0001: A playable manifesto
 theChief#0001: THAT'S what the opposition is missing!
 birdstone#3073: oh noooo lmfao
 wren#0640: a playable political manifesto
 theChief#0001: UK politics stuff, our man child in chief was forced out recently 😂
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Are we talking about Game Jam games and Game Jam stuff? (And definitely not politics?)
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: basically, let's make a political manifesto for the jam.
 birdstone#3073: lmfao where is this going
 theChief#0001: At least with Boris you know he's not getting much done 😉
 birdstone#3073: oh i know a very competent tony
 wren#0640: oh that is arguably worse yeah
 theChief#0001: But is the replacement going to be a _competent_ Tory?
 wren#0640: will not be missed
 wren#0640: rip bojo
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: already been happening hasn't it
 birdstone#3073: what's wrong with a tori?
 wren#0640: sooo true
 theChief#0001: No we need fewer tories
 birdstone#3073: man we need more attouries
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: thank you so much.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: no please keep it how it was unedited
 birdstone#3073: why would i become an attourney
 birdstone#3073: become an attourey
 wren#0640: exactly
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: downloading the original mario brothers and editing the super mario bros title to be "HI MADE BY EWE" and in the trademark text it's just "TRANS RIGHTS BTW" instead of the trademark because if there is no trademark text they can't sue you
 birdstone#3073: guys i found free minecraft on this website called bifytlx.xyz
 wren#0640: didnt realise they were free til i torrented them
 cathy#3897: how
 wren#0640: not that i pirate games im a perfectly upstanding legal citizen
 birdstone#3073: how do you accidentally pirate a game lmao
 wren#0640: ive accidentally pirated free games before
 birdstone#3073: he has a point
 wren#0640: thats legally binding
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: the idea of pirating fortnite is so funny honestly
 M_Raven#4076: Me about to pirate Fornite and write "Made by Maven :)" in the files:
 birdstone#3073: watch itch get obliterated again like the previous years
 wren#0640: just write your name on the filename of the rom then its yours you made it
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: fastest way for itch to just obliterate me from earth
 birdstone#3073: yes
 JuliusCube#8501: ik
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: idk honestly im just considering downloading a rom for mario and luigi super star saga for the game boy advance and sending that
 birdstone#3073: the first computers ran on punch cards lmao
 JuliusCube#8501: turns out the punch cards are for a card game
 birdstone#3073: hell yeah lets make a game with punch cards everyone
 M_Raven#4076: Me and the boys Game Jamming with punch cards
 JuliusCube#8501: whos planning on doing the jam on their gucci smart toilet? /j
 birdstone#3073: *i was trying to make a pun lol*
 birdstone#3073: i'll stop lmao
 M_Raven#4076: Nah nah, game jam on a smart fridge
 birdstone#3073: who's planning to do the jam on their drone?
 wren#0640: this is an all ages jam :)
 wren#0640: lol
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: ey
 birdstone#3073: i could drone on and on about this
 M_Raven#4076: fair
 birdstone#3073: idk, after playing "turnip boy commits tax evasion" my sense of what makes a good title has been altered a bit
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: there are things i cannot say about drones in here
 M_Raven#4076: Drone Demolition, except it's a drone demolishing the world
 birdstone#3073: again for myself that's not bad but i feel like there could be a better option
for some reason it doesn't sit right with me, it's all up to you
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Dronolition
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: to the level of wealth redistribution
 birdstone#3073: taking "it's just a game" to the next level
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: generic alliteration.
Also I swear the message cooldown timer goes up every time i send a message
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: and making it an OS that i install on elon musks phone without him knowing and get away from hacking charges by saying that it's a game
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: yeah
 birdstone#3073: to me that feels the tiniest bit generic
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: drone demolition
 birdstone#3073: making an idle game that charges you a dollar every time you tap
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: fair enough
 birdstone#3073: up to you, i have no ideas lol
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: making a game that wires all of elon musks money in my account so i distribute it around the world
 birdstone#3073: my old computer shat itself when i ran a while loop
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: What name should I give it
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: jam theme: solve global hunger in real life, actually
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Sure, I'll try make that.
 birdstone#3073: i'd play that
 M_Raven#4076: Watch the jam theme be something like "fuck it, make something that blows up your computer"
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: You are a drone with limited battery, and you need to cause as much annoyance and destruction and return back before your battery runs out
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: that's fine it was just a general reminder as people are talking about game ideas
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: not for the jam
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Remember not to do any game design for you jam game before the jam starts
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Maybe we can combine the ideas
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: a drone could be flying around taking pictures
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Hmm maybe
 Lyfe#8258: Yeah but if you have to navigate some cool looking areas the level design might carry it, or if there's a system of modifying your drone it might work
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: interesting
 birdstone#3073: that was an awful attempt at a joke i'm sorry lmao
 M_Raven#4076: I mean I'm imagining something along the lines of this one car game where the goal was to just park correctly
 Redline#7370: well that's you, but I don't have anything VR related
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: could probably get repetitive
 birdstone#3073: its ok i have a google cardboard im basically all set
 Snakes#8442: Atrocities
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: haha a drone with a laser just destroying everything
 Redline#7370: that's not a good idea since a lot of people don't have VR stuff
 M_Raven#4076: ^^^
 wren#0640: would a vr game be against rules because it doesnt run on windows without peripherals?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: doesn't the jam rules say that keyboard and mouse is a minimum required control scheme for the game?
 birdstone#3073: i mean that's what i did when i was younger and got a hold of a drone
 M_Raven#4076: with explosives
 Lyfe#8258: Land it in the right spot with your extremely limited battery
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: how on earth would you just annoy people lol
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: I was thinking delivering packages lol
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: lmao
 birdstone#3073: "untitled drone game"
 Lyfe#8258: I wonder if anyone's tried to make a VR game for the jam
 M_Raven#4076: ^^^
 birdstone#3073: annoy people
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Also thinking of making a game where you are a drone - but I can't think of what you'd do?
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Thanks, I shall try that 😄
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: that is definitely one of the difficult things, I would suggest you make a list of all the mechanics you want etc
Split it in to essential and desirable
Put each list in priority order
Start making things in order of the most important stuff on the essentials list and as time ticks down cross things off the bottom of the desirable list
 Lyfe#8258: I'm not actually going to do that btw in case it wasn't obvious
 Lyfe#8258: Me searching gmtk on github and finding all the projects that people forgot to make closed source and just uploading one of them
 birdstone#3073: goodluck, we know you can do it
 Scolon#4218: It wouldn't be against the rules but it would be against the spirit of the jam
 Zutilt10 | Jonathan. W#0339: Didn't get it done the last time but maybe this time will be different
 birdstone#3073: equivalent of ghostwriting lmao
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: true, although I can't come up with simple ideas that well either.
 wren#0640: would it be against jam rules to pay someone to make a game for you and submit it under your name
 Zutilt10 | Jonathan. W#0339: 2nd times the charm
 Lyfe#8258: And using the rest for other jams
 birdstone#3073: solution: make a program that makes a game for you
 Scolon#4218: Don't underestimate the amount of enjoyment people can have from simple things!
 Lyfe#8258: Me building 100s of games and just picking the one that closest matches the theme
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: Its so hard to find a balance between oversimplication and overcomplication
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: My project has overscoped again 🙄
 birdstone#3073: we're all cheaters now
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Several people are typing...
 Jeker#3389: fucc
 M_Raven#4076: No you've made 1% progress by breathing
 Jeker#3389: same
 Scolon#4218: Yeah I have made 0 progress on anything, just working on an old project atm
 birdstone#3073: "Some of the messages in here sound like people are trying to make significant progress before the jam begins, with the intention of pivoting the design to match the theme. That’s not within the spirit of the rules - please play fair, and use the jam for its intended purpose: to flex your creative muscles and to challenge yourself."
 wren#0640: so true
 birdstone#3073: i think that's mostly just not in the spirit of the jam
 wren#0640: is deciding i want to make a video game before the jam cheating? because im basically just shoehorning the theme into a pre existing game right
 birdstone#3073: YOU MONSTER
 M_Raven#4076: Imagine
 birdstone#3073: lol the only metal i really like is from the doom ost
 Scolon#4218: Oh god, oh no, I'm breathing before the jam starts. Sorry guys, I know it's cheating
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Cypress Hills is in NYC.
 Lyfe#8258: My head is made of bones and flesh and brain
 Jeker#3389: smh smh
 birdstone#3073: how could you
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: oh god oh no i thought about videogames in the last second i'm cheating oh dear god
 M_Raven#4076: Damn am I the only metalhead
 birdstone#3073: for me a mix of doom hollow knight and cuphead lmao
 Jeker#3389: mostly hotline miami ost
 M_Raven#4076: Oh no! My mere presence in this server counts as cheating! What will I ever do
 birdstone#3073: dammit whyd you tell them now im gonna get in trouble too
 Jeker#3389: wow i am cheating i am preparing music to listen to during the jam before the jam starts smh
 birdstone#3073: the biggest swords ive seen is cloud and sephiroth's swords
 M_Raven#4076: Yep
 Martin111#0333: naw, haven't played mh yet
you're referring to the cat-chefs?
 M_Raven#4076: I forgot his name and what his race is called
 M_Raven#4076: Have you seen that one catperson from Monster Hunter? The one who uses a giant broken sword to cut food
 Martin111#0333: anime-cooking-knife
 birdstone#3073: lmfao its a very big knife
 M_Raven#4076: Your sword is actually part of the tools you use to prepare (poisoned) food for your enemies
 Martin111#0333: bonk
 Selviam#7268: or when the gun jams it becomes a melee weapon
 Martin111#0333: as a jam theme?
or just as an idea
 birdstone#3073: oh it would be cool to see something like "using weapons in a way you're not supposed to"
 Jeker#3389: if you havent, search up souvlaki, you wont regret it
 Martin111#0333: ye that was the idea
No clue at all how to implement: but we'll see at some point
 Selviam#7268: I really like it you could probably use the spilled flammable oil to take out enemies in a more creative way
 Jeker#3389: Greece is souvlaki land
 Jeker#3389: thats cyprus
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Greece is Halloumi land
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: I meant italy .
 birdstone#3073: summarizing greece as pizza land
 Martin111#0333: A rando idea in my head is to make a medium-to-fast paced FPS where all your guns are shady
Trying to reload your flamethrower just causes a slippery flammable oil spill
Trying to shoot your revolver makes it jam randomly )
Not a Jam idea, just a game idea; any thoughts?
 wren#0640: i cooka the meatball
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: pizza land
 M_Raven#4076: Me, half-chinese half-indonesian living in America:
 Jeker#3389: Greece? Anyone? No just me?
 theChief#0001: My name is Dominic if that counts?
 Jeker#3389: Oh, yeah got what you mean
 birdstone#3073: canadian here
 Teslobo#8274: It's just very not-plagiarism if you make something like it
 birdstone#3073: see you
 Astral#7476: Bye!
 Teslobo#8274: Oh it's absolutely a fun game
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Imma head out. Take care everyone!
 birdstone#3073: i will be making minecraft 2 when the jam starts
 Jeker#3389: well still a fun game in my opinion
 M_Raven#4076: I'm saving all the brainstorming for when we get the theme
 Scolon#4218: All I know is that I want to do something cool with procedural generation and the theme, I want to avoid traditional roguelike dungeon generation
 Teslobo#8274: Tbf nuclear throne is very generic once you cut back all the jooce
 Jeker#3389: **i am starting to realise i am making basically nuclear throne**
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: no
 Martin111#0333: oo
 birdstone#3073: the buttons are enemies
 Jeker#3389: No, thinking more of nuclear throne style
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Hey can we get a game where you play on the main menu?
 Martin111#0333: like a endless runner sorta deal?
 birdstone#3073: lmao
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Well then you atleast made something nice :) even if it took you a day.
 M_Raven#4076: Aminus moment
 Jeker#3389: I am thinking of maybe an infinite scorer roguelike?
 birdstone#3073: i went nearly all out with polish last year
 Scolon#4218: I'm scoping really small initially and using the remaining time to expand and polish
 M_Raven#4076: It was a very good main menu ngl
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: god same. spent most of my time on like. a save system which took 2 days out of a whole 7
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: That best have been the best main menu ever.
 wren#0640: im probably gonna try to get everything mechanically done on friday/saturday and then just use the rest of the time to work on levels if i decide to do something level based?
 Scolon#4218: lmao
 birdstone#3073: lol priorities
 M_Raven#4076: Dear god I hope I don't do the same thing I did in another game jam where I spent a whole day on a main menu and ended up not finishing the game itself
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: last time it took me 2-3 hours to actually decide but i guess that was fine in a seven day jam
 theChief#0001: I want my core mechanics done by around 8am on Saturday tbh
 birdstone#3073: haha i normally just get my idea within the first hour and a half and mold it as i go
 Zoro5168#0115: India gang
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Ayyy same Europe gang.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: day one is mostly going to be ideas and maybe prototyping
 Jeker#3389: Europe gang am i right?
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I both love and hate the fact the jam ends on my bday. Like it's so nice it does but on the other hand I got a party from 2 pm to 8 pm where I cannot sit on my pc
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: being european i have my work structure cut out for me since i technically have 3 days
 Jeker#3389: i probably wont
 Scolon#4218: Yeah I want to have all my core mechanics and content done day 1, if possible
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Send those games my way :3 (except the 17th unless you do it early.) I'm just gonna have a weekend full of fun and I'm all for it.
 Jeker#3389: Ok look, i did some game jams before, enough with the bullshit i did, this time i am limiting myself to making: Level generation, main mechanic player movement day one and a bloody menu, and day 2 for polishing
 theChief#0001: You're on the team if you're helping playtest 😉 if I actually manage to stick to my plan and send out early builds, you'll be credited!
 theChief#0001: Like I said, "to me it's clearer" 😁 everyone has a different style!
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I got respect for everyone here. Except myself cus I'm literally just gonna play games all weekend.
 Jeker#3389: Cool, but I am mostly used to more classic stuff like constructors
 Redline#7370: me all the time
 M_Raven#4076: Me last year: 😭
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I got respect for everyone participating. Ofcourse the 11 person team
 theChief#0001: I don't tend to use constructors because I prefer this syntax:
```cs
Glock = new Gun
{
fireRate = 0.5f,
damage = 1f,
description= "Lock n' Load",
// Etc
};```- to me it's a lot clearer and helps work out what each thing is doing!
Not that I'd use a class like that anyway. I'd do this in a ScriptableObject, then it's 0  lines of code per gun 😉
 Astral#7476: Not so much in higher-resolution tho, at least from my expirience
 Astral#7476: I think its because, not having detail in low res shows
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I could do that but I'm more comfy when I have more space.
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: For me it's weird, I am better making larger sprites than smaller ones. So if I had to use 8x8 I would hate it XD
 wren#0640: i quite like how 24x24 sprites look tbh
 JuliusCube#8501: agree
 Astral#7476: Oh, I got it, I am thinking of limiting the sprite size to 24x24 max
 wren#0640: which overall makes the game look worse
 wren#0640: a big problem with a lot of gamejam games is they over complicate sprites without much experience
 Jeker#3389: Most of my games take inspiration either from meat boy, or hotline miami or both
 wren#0640: yeah definitely
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: start simple and get complex later. learn the basics first before running with complex things
 Astral#7476: Oh, haha
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Attempts always count. I've done pixelart for 3 years now and still feel like I dont know what I'm doing lol
 Jeker#3389: i dont know why i see constructors being used this little in general
 Astral#7476: Well, I am just starting to learn pixel art, so my game wont look the greatest, but oh well, I guess an attempt counts!
 JuliusCube#8501: idk why i see constructors being used in game jam games so little. theyre really useful
 theChief#0001: If anyone playing most of my games feels "relaxed" at any point I consider it a great failure 😂
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: you can always go hyper minimal with 8x8 sprites
 Jeker#3389: and it is! And it works so well
 theChief#0001: ... I do not make relaxing games 😉
 Jeker#3389: now most of you, will realise, this is a bloody constructor
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Simple shapes style can be relaxing tbh.
 birdstone#3073: our trio
 cathy#3897: welp we've got a talented musician too
 theChief#0001: I generally go for the "simple shapes" style 😂
 Jeker#3389: ```csharp
public static readonly Gun Glock = new Gun.glockSprite, 50, false, "Lock n' Load");
```
Like, this is all i have to do
 ThePatientHusky#7229: very true
 Viola_Buddy#6763: At the very least my plan is to not do at least some of that. I'm going to either nab free-to-use art assets or just have everything be squares and circles and letters.
 theChief#0001: You don't, you do it in about 30 😂 sleeping, eating and going out for some fresh air is important
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: That sounds great.
 Jeker#3389: like, holy shit thats good, i can just add a weapon in one line of code
 Jeker#3389: the best thing i have made in this project is the weapon manager
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Imma go back to celebrating being a playtester. Idk why I'm just too happy about it.
 birdstone#3073: same
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: frantically
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Like how do you come up with an idea, make art, code a game, playtest that game, etc in 48 hours.
 cathy#3897: so true
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I have so much respect for people doing this alone.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i have only myself
 birdstone#3073: haha so do i right 
 Jeker#3389: well, i have an actually talented artist working on this lol, so yeah
 birdstone#3073: lol i think that applies to a lot of creative things
 birdstone#3073: walk cycles are excruciating
and that's probably because i dont' have much experience with animation
 Jeker#3389: the running animation was especially tricky to get right, because the arm of the player rotates based on the cursor's position, and well the game is a side scroller
 cathy#3897: the more I've progressed in skill for art the harder it is to be creative lmao
 cathy#3897: yup but then afterwards i kinda lose motivation for a while
 Jeker#3389: anyways, on other news i have animations in my game (like, the main project i am working on
 wren#0640: i never have the motivation to work on jam games that i didnt meet the deadline for too which just kinda rubs salt into the wound
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: It's what I have with art, when I finish something i can be like I made this piece of art. And yea it's an amazing feeling
 wren#0640: that too which is why it really sucks when you cant submit for a jam lol
 birdstone#3073: yeah and seeing your stuff improve over time is incredibly rewarding
 birdstone#3073: i think initially i was skeptical about doing a jam but last years results gave me a huge motivation boost
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: it's just the feeling to make a thing for me. i can look back and go "wow. i made a thing"
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I'm just happy to be helping someone yknow? I don't know much about how useful it is.
 wren#0640: because i both had a finished product and actually had people play something i made
 wren#0640: yeah i dont think i wouldve stuck with it if i didnt start by doing a jam honestly
 birdstone#3073: that's probably one of the reasons i started game making
i'm sure a lot of people have the same reason
 OrangoMango#0973: yeah
 Hobusu#5033: Playtesting is super valuable!
 wren#0640: yeah its genuinely so cool to see people play something you made live
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I'm just happy I can try to help people by play testing. Take that mental health
 birdstone#3073: i remember last year i loved watching streamers try my game and see their reactions
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Woo I'm now a playtester XD Way to spend my weekend :D
 Hobusu#5033: OoT3D I can safely say is a strict upgrade over the original for most players, but with MM3D there are reasons to still play the original instead
 Hobusu#5033: MM3D is kind of a mixed bag, some things are improved and there are new features but other things are made worse for some reason
 birdstone#3073: i got spyros adventure on the 3ds and thought i got the wrong game because i was used to playing it on my friend's wii
 wren#0640: is majoras mask 3d worth playing over the original?
 birdstone#3073: actually about skylanders why were the different editions completely different depending on the platform?
 Hobusu#5033: It's telling that Majora's Mask 3D was rated E10 by the ESRB, which I think they would've done back when the original released if that rating had existed at the time
 birdstone#3073: *past memories unlocked*
 wren#0640: majoras mask is on paper like my exact kind of game but when ive tried to play it i just cant get over the sorta clunky n64 camera
 birdstone#3073: lmao i remember coming across the binding of isaac by accident on the eshop and i had trouble sleeping
 M_Raven#4076: ok ok
Did you ever play Skylanders?
 birdstone#3073: WII SPORTS
 Hobusu#5033: That's a very reasonable reaction for that age, heh
 birdstone#3073: lol i'll definitely try it when i get the chance, i started really liking dark and scary themes
 M_Raven#4076: I never really got to play "old" games, the oldest I know of were Wii games
 ChiptuneKirby#7868: Wind Waker is still my favorite.
 Loulor#5705: Hi  , Someone just try to contact me for my post in Team Finder, but i can't contact him/her, her @ in  is at 19:44, can i have something for join her/him ?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: oh it is and that's why it's so awesome. the oot people looked at oot and thought "yeah but what if it was kind of grimy and scary thematically."
 birdstone#3073: 9 year old me was spooked by a lot of things
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: heavy contender for best zelda game honestly, only second to TP
 birdstone#3073: i never got it when i was a kid because i thought it looked too scary
 ChiptuneKirby#7868: Yeah, Majora's Mask is amazing.
 birdstone#3073: i'm still a sucker for roguelikes
 wren#0640: i feel like ive played almost none of the like top 100 "classics"
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: if you need a guide use it. but the reward for it is honestly priceless
 birdstone#3073: ayyyyyy hello 
 wren#0640: god i need to play more games
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: do get all masks
 M_Raven#4076: I have returned 🔥👄🔥
 birdstone#3073: i was thinking of trying majora's mask so that sounds promising
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: just the whole sequence is so good for the way it just feels and is structured. plus if you get all the masks it's just... so good
 birdstone#3073: stalbind
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: majora, no doubt.
 birdstone#3073: lol unfortunately i never played winderwaker
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: the only difference is that the game is mirrored because canonically link is left handed but you hold the wiimote in your right hand (generally)
 ChiptuneKirby#7868: Molgera. Just for the music alone.
 wren#0640: i might play the gc version tbh, my only wiimote is slightly busted so no motion controls and theyre surprisingly hard to find for a reasonable price second hand now
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: honestly i might re-play it in the GC version
 Hobusu#5033: Twilight Princess HD is my preferred version now of course
 birdstone#3073: favourite zelda boss?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: yup
 Hobusu#5033: Yeah
 wren#0640: oh wait it uses motion controls in the wii version right?
 birdstone#3073: ooooo i like that
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: aw
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: GOD the ganondorf fight is so good in tp...
 BurnV06#5857: I actually have a game idea based on LBW’s merge mechanic where in a 2d platformer you can switch between parallel universes with slightly different layouts by pressing a button. However, it’ll only work if you have enough energy, which you get by obtaining collectables. The graphics would be 1-bit, with one dimension being predominantly white and the other predominantly black.
 Squishy Turtle#3988: dude same
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: just the atmosphere and the story are fantastic honestly. midna is such a well written character for tloz standards. i really only have a few complaints with how the wolf link sections are distributed throughout the game
 Hobusu#5033: I'm not going to say Twilight Princess is the *best* one, but it's certainly my favorite in large part because of nostalgia (it was the first video game I ever beat)
 birdstone#3073: my parents never let me get it at the time lmao
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: my favorite 3d zelda is without a doubt twilight princess
 Hobusu#5033: or bring a green potion
 BurnV06#5857: I remember the fire rod does way more damage than other attacks against Mothula, but there’s an annoying torch puzzle right before the fight that wastes basically all of one’s magic, so you basically have to use your sword, which is like 32 hits to kill mothula
 birdstone#3073: when i played link between worlds i remember i didn't care about the dungeons and just thought the wall merging ability was super cool
 wren#0640: ACTUALLY i really enjoyed wind waker
 wren#0640: havent really tried twilight princess or skyward sword
 wren#0640: at least the classic ones, they just didnt click with me
 BurnV06#5857: Oh
 wren#0640: ive never really liked the 3d zeldas til botw if im honest
 Hobusu#5033: Did you know Mothula can take damage from the Good Bee?
 birdstone#3073: the only game i remember finishing on an emulator was mother 3
 wren#0640: i had the gba port physically but my save corrupted 😔
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: why bother with lttp if majora's mask is right there honestly?
 birdstone#3073: i tried it on an emulator and lost all my progress so i just gave up lol
 birdstone#3073: i think i was just generally scared of any of the dark dungeons, i never got to see dark palace because i was too stupid to figure out how to not get seen by the guards in front
 wren#0640: ive played the first few hours of lttp so many times but ive never beaten it
 BurnV06#5857: Yeah I do that
 birdstone#3073: it would be fun to revisit these games now
 BurnV06#5857: Yeah I think so. Been a few months since I beat it tho
 birdstone#3073: yeah for some reason i was really scared of those lmao
 Joe Mcdermott#9590: It did
 birdstone#3073: did lttp have wallmasters or whatever they're called? like the hand things that try to smack you from above
 BurnV06#5857: Idk about LBW, but Skull Woods’ boss is annoying af on LTTP
 birdstone#3073: but i never finished it because 9 year old me was too spooked to play through the skull woods dungeon
 birdstone#3073: i remember playing a link between worlds a lot
 birdstone#3073: ahhh ok
 Joe Mcdermott#9590: That and it was second hand.
 birdstone#3073: overuse?
 BurnV06#5857: I got the wii u exclusively for playing Super Mario Maker. 8 year old me lost my crap when it was announced
 Joe Mcdermott#9590: I've got a 2DS but the circle pad has disintegrated.
 wren#0640: i have a gba hardware clone now but its not as cool
 birdstone#3073: i think i still have it
 wren#0640: still so mad about that
 birdstone#3073: the closest i have to that was the original 3ds
 wren#0640: i had a gba flashcart too and then i fucking left it on a bus
 wren#0640: oughh i miss my ds lite
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: you know what i really actually want? a ds lite.
 birdstone#3073: i thought about getting a wii u
but then the switch came out
 birdstone#3073: i forgot that existed lol
 wren#0640: ebay
 BurnV06#5857: I have two wiis if you count my wii u
 birdstone#3073: you can still buy them? i'm assuming from another seller
 Joe Mcdermott#9590: I got that backwards compatibility on Wii U.
 wren#0640: theyre still great emulation machines once you get the homebrew channel on them
 wren#0640: i bought a wii recently
 birdstone#3073: man i wish i still had my wii
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: works fine for me, probably a local problem
 birdstone#3073: i played it on some online emulator lmao
 wren#0640: iirc the 20th anniversary kirby collection on the wii was so small that you could take the disc out and it would still run on the ram
 Samsmeep Singh#2566: Guys I can’t open the game jam website in general what’s going on there
 Hobusu#5033: It was also possible to buy Kirby's Adventure through Wii Virtual Console, that's how I first played it
 birdstone#3073: yeah it had a different name in some places, that's why i was confused
i thought it was like kirby's adventure 1993
 BurnV06#5857: The first one I 100%ed is the Henry Stickmin Collection. I don’t 100% games very much
 birdstone#3073: OH i loved that game so much
 birdstone#3073: kirby's adventure was on the wii?
 wren#0640: think it was released as return to dreamland in the us?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: now i feel as though i'm changed? and definitely not in a good way
 wren#0640: i dont remember the first game i played at all but im pretty sure the first game i beat to 100% was kirby's adventure for the wii
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i played through most of the games
 birdstone#3073: i learned about that series pretty late and was really confused with seeing like mickey and sephiroth in the same place
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: guess that does track, game has mickey mouse in it
 BurnV06#5857: Not my exact first game but when I was like 4 I remember playing this really weird DS game about Dora the explorer making a pizza for some reason
 birdstone#3073: you just made me remember so many memories thank you
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: my first game was Kingdom Hearts
 NitramiuZ#4145: One of the first games I remember playing was Bloons TD 3 on the ninja kiwi website
 BurnV06#5857: I had wii play but sucked too much at the pong knockoff to unlock tanks. Very sad
 birdstone#3073: we were like 8 lmao
 birdstone#3073: my friend broke one of my controllers because of that
 Joe Mcdermott#9590: wii play tanks is truly the greatest game ever made.
 Jeker#3389: I actually never had a nintendo console
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: one of my first flash games I played was actually a Mario bros game with super Mario bros all stars sprites that had a level editor. yet  another step in a descent into madness known as game design
 birdstone#3073: man wii play and wii sports were actually so fun
 ChiptuneKirby#7868: My first was Wii Play XD Not counting that though, Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker was I think my first game.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Mine might have been ExciteBike
 DrNukeLear#2414: Class
 Redline#7370: I think mine was either trackmania united forever or like the original first angry birds on PC
 Beeg scarf#3571: Mario was probably still first though lol
 birdstone#3073: oh my god
 Beeg scarf#3571: First game i recall playing is mortal kombat 2
 Jeker#3389: maro
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Everyone's first game was mario. Lol.
 Joe Mcdermott#9590: Mario kart wii was probably my first game.
 Nobody6502#8971: man super mario *land* is a very uncommon answer to that question
 birdstone#3073: it's all mario bros lmao
 Jeker#3389: i played like a flash recreation of mario bros, was suprissingly good
 MistTree#0001: mine was sonic on a random website
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I can't remember my first game. Might have been Super Mario Bros on the NES.
 BurnV06#5857: I have a copy of super mario land
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: that's interesting
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: nobody said it was equal, but the code is part of the game
 BurnV06#5857: Ocarina of Time 3D
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: huh, lotsa people started with Mario even throughout generations
 DrNukeLear#2414: Wow! I think I’ve got that somewhere.
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: Greetings
 Zoro5168#0115: Im still in shock that you werent supposed to shoot the dog
 Mark Brown#6982: Uhmmmmmm, I think maybe Super Mario Land on the GB
 Redline#7370: technically code != game
 DrNukeLear#2414: 😐
 BurnV06#5857: Hey MB
 birdstone#3073: i stand corrected
 Mark Brown#6982: Just to be clear on this, Rose - the rules state that "we ask that you don’t write code specifically for this jam, ahead of time" - so whether it's content or code solutions doesn't really matter. The spirit of the jam is you start making the game at 18:00 BST on July 15th
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: remember very clearly playing smb1 and going "I wanna do this when I'm big", this being the game itself
 birdstone#3073: that might be what he's typing lol
 Jeker#3389: i used a computer since i was like, 6 or 7
 DrNukeLear#2414: Mr Brown (I can see you typing), what’s the first game you can remember playing?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: my first game was Mario bros 1 on a knockoff NES emulator thingie, like those polystation deals
 wren#0640: the drm for that was really cool
 Jeker#3389: lol nice
 DrNukeLear#2414: Ironically it was a pirate copy of a pirate game.
 birdstone#3073: i think my first game was new super mario bros 2
 wren#0640: theyre remaking that arent they?
 DrNukeLear#2414: The first game I can remember playing was The Secret if Monkey Island. It came on 4 floppy disks.
 Jeker#3389: just less violent
 Beeg scarf#3571: He is
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: like from a design perspective the fact that the dog is here at all is kind of confusing? it makes sense logically that a hound would be there to help you hunt, but it doesn't really help with giving clarity for what you need to do if you don't speak english
 cathy#3897: i thought the dog was the villian
 Jeker#3389: It was like, on the computer, but it was like spelunky meets hotline miami
 Jeker#3389: the first game i played was so weird i dont even remember it lol
 birdstone#3073: lmao i see
 Jeker#3389: we are talking about duck hunt btw
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: that's interesting though from a design perspective
 birdstone#3073: **what kind of game were you playing**
 Jeker#3389: i mean....thats a logical assumption i guess
 Zoro5168#0115: I was like just need to shoot the dog cuz he keeps hiding from me
 Jeker#3389: fair point indeed
 wren#0640: fair enough
 Zoro5168#0115: Im not from an english speaking country
 DrNukeLear#2414: Lol
 wren#0640: you hunt the ducks
 wren#0640: the games literally called duck hunt
 Zoro5168#0115: I used to shoot him all the time
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: LMAO
 Scolon#4218: wtf 💀
 Zoro5168#0115: REALLY?
 Jeker#3389: you are meant to shoot the ducks 💀
 DrNukeLear#2414: Nice
 Zoro5168#0115: I have a working shoot the dog on the tv game i forgot its name
 Jeker#3389: I saw one in a street sale, but it was being sold for like, 60 euro and i didnt know if it was working
 BurnV06#5857: I have a working gameboy color
 Jeker#3389: oh thats cool
 DrNukeLear#2414: I know. I actually have a working condition c64.
 Jeker#3389: well, if it makes you feel better you are younger than the c64
 Tapu#9161:
 Jeker#3389: mostly used 7 tho
 Jeker#3389: Oh, thats younger than i expected lol
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: oh damn gotta respect the age
 DrNukeLear#2414: 37 lol
 Zoro5168#0115: Man idk anything yall talkin about
 Jeker#3389: Damn, how old are you mate?
 DrNukeLear#2414: Amiga workbench....
 Jeker#3389: i used xp when i was like, 5
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: welcome to the gmtk jam, where we try to find ways that the rules are imperfect and talk about the infinitely progressing march of time
 Zoro5168#0115: Add a year to that and thats my birth year
 BurnV06#5857: Mine was XP
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: my first OS was vista.
 BurnV06#5857: Yeah somebody said that about wii sports once and same thing for me
 DrNukeLear#2414: I was coding before you were born.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: oh god someone could legitimately call wii games retro now
 DrNukeLear#2414: It still hurts when I think of a game I used to play on release and someone describes it as retro.
 BurnV06#5857: I was born the same month Windows Vista was released
 BurnV06#5857: I’ve heard of Echo the dolphin from a retro gaming magazine I bought once
 RedTeapot#1960: Same. Even though Wikipedia says I'm a zoomer
 IntangibleMatter#2281: I go 'kids these days' about people in my grade
 Zoro5168#0115: Im only as old as ps2's
 IntangibleMatter#2281: Same, except I'm 16
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i'm only 21 and i feel completely disconnected from the youths
 Viola_Buddy#6763: It's an interesting thought, though, because that would feel exactly like a platformer, just vertically inverted. It would be programmed like a platformer too. Taking mechanics and doing them backwards is going to feel very similar to doing them forwards, even if they're completely backwards.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: ... like echo the dolphin for one of the first sega consoles?
 Zoro5168#0115: Thats like those mobile games where you dive into the water and come up like a dolphin
 BurnV06#5857: Opposite of a racing game = me in gym class doing laps
 DrNukeLear#2414: Opposite of a Rhythm game = me on a dance floor
 BurnV06#5857: Might actually be a decent idea if implemented properly now that I think of it
 Scolon#4218: platformer
platform breaker?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: lol
 BurnV06#5857: The opposite of a platformer is a game where you press a button to dig down into the ground before coming back up
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I think the idea of the "opposite" of genre is... not really a thing
 wren#0640: a save system is generally not something youd implement in a jam game tbh if its level based id just add a level selection menu its far easier and allows people to experience more of the game if they get stuck
 redka#6365: to clarify, the idea came to us when the theme was announced
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Not if you are making it specially for the jam. If its super generic then you probably have them as part of other games you've made, or you could get them online. But you don't know you'll need a save system until you design your game
 wren#0640: the knights jump
 MistTree#0001: chess
 Jeker#3389: wait wouldnt the exact opposite of a platformer, be a game where you dont use the arrow keys/wasd? Aka like a clicker game?
 redka#6365: we had an idea for a life-link slasher too but we dismissed it because none of us had any experience making that before
 MistTree#0001: im so hype to join the jam and make a vid about it. it's gonna be sick
 Viola_Buddy#6763: The direct opposite would be, like, a farming sim or something
 redka#6365: i mean i have a fairly solid conviction in genre, last year we decided the genre a day before the jam (single screen platformer) and stuck to it throughout
 Jeker#3389: yes, true
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: so something general like a save system or an options menu seems sensible to me to make in advance - just a method to save data to a file and load it back, and a way to change the options in general like changing inputs and window size
 wren#0640: i mean a game can be both a platformer and a roguelike
 Zoro5168#0115: Im just gonna say what i said before
 Jeker#3389: I mean, i've done only platformers, so i am fed up, and want to make a roguelike which is the direct opposite i think
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: that's fine, but you wouldn't know for sure you were making a roguelike or a platformer before the theme drops because you wouldn't be designing anything before the jam
 redka#6365: i mean i think deciding a genre is fair, especially if you're justifying it as the genre you're most familiar with
 Zoro5168#0115: Thas nice
 MistTree#0001: i just got myself a gmtk2022 shirt
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: You must not design the game in advance: eg genre, mechanics, style, theme.
Like for example, if you are able to know in advance what tools you need then you've designed your game in advance
 Jeker#3389: oh hi
 redka#6365: i usually find that implementation is very different from the idea, i can have a really cool idea for a roguelike, but i've only ever done platformers, if I set myself the constraint of "no procedural stuff no matter how well you think it fits" i have a better chance of making it to the end
 MistTree#0001: hey dude
 Jeker#3389: fair point actually, i'd say its...planning way to ahead
 AkariZero#2463: Yeah my first mistake other than being depressed during my first game jam attempt was the fact my group and I decided 2d tactical RPG was a good idea for a weekend XD
 Jeker#3389: uhhhhhh
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: so where does making pseudocode fall?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Having an idea of something you'd like to make is different to designing it in advance.
Eg you could be hoping to make a roguelike but then the theme drops and you get an awesome idea for a platformer. That's fine
 redka#6365: we've pre-emptively decided a genre and what mechanics we don't want to implement (for example, because they'd take too long or we have no experience with them)
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Same.
 Jeker#3389: The only asset that i have and is re-usable from another project, is a sound manager
 Scolon#4218: Yeah I can't get a coherent train of thought without the theme anyway
 AkariZero#2463: The theme is where you get your creativity from
 Scolon#4218: I'll probably rip some menus/options code from my other project but other than that I'm not doing anything
 AkariZero#2463: In general thinking ahead can save you a lot of time IMO. You want game ideas that you know you can build fast within a short period of time.
 Scolon#4218: Yeah I only know what general genre I want to make, I don't have any ideas other than that
 Jeker#3389: yeah
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i don't think mark can ban the concept of thinking ahead about how to implement a system
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: that seems reasonable
 Jeker#3389: i dont think its cheating, cause i have, no idea how i will implement this in code
 Viola_Buddy#6763: Ah I see. That's probably general enough to apply to multiple themes.
 Jeker#3389: well, i want to make a roguelike, so i kind off tried to write down some stuff for the random generation
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: save systems or option menus or inventory systems can be theme agnostic
 Zoro5168#0115: They're just improving their various skills before the jam which i think is absolutely fine and as they stated theyre not going to use the code itself but if they face a similar problem in the jam they can overcom3 it basically
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Oh swim time. I gtg. *rolls back out*
 Viola_Buddy#6763: It is worth noting that it's kind of weird that you have a system in mind already, without knowing the theme. The system may not work with the theme at all. Or maybe it will (maybe the math is general enough that it can apply to multiple different ways of implementing mechanics?). You may or may not need to abandon the idea, even putting aside the question of rules.
 Astral#7476: I am doing good as well, thank you for asking! 🙂
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I'm good, wbu?
 Scolon#4218: Hi
 Astral#7476: Hi! How are you?
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: *rolls in* good day/night/timezone to everyone.
 Triggered#6897: I wonder if we have talked about stranger things s4 (if it s allowed)
Edit - Did not meant to reply sorry
 Jeker#3389: oh, alright
 Scolon#4218: Learning how to do something/figuring out something should be fine I think, it's not like you actually created an asset to use in the jam before it started
 Lyfe#8258: I feel like if you make a main menu or smth that's so basic it's really not that deep
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Now with that all said you literally have ALL the information you can and will get. It is the choice of you and your team if you feel it fits the rules and also the spirit of the jam. There is nothing more to add to this conversation as there is no further information so I suggest we move on
 redka#6365: every mistake we find in the workflow is another hour saved
 Jeker#3389: uhhhh i did some math, on paper for a system i want, thats not against the rules right?
 redka#6365: i mean, by the definition of practice we're going to have a headstart in the form of better organization
 NitramiuZ#4145: Past jams I've been doing 14 hour game dev days, I put all my awake time on jams, trying to make as much as possible in 48 hours, it works out for me and I don't feel worn out afterwards and I'm glad over that because it's so fun!
 theChief#0001: Basically practice is fine, writing code with the intention of using that code during the jam is 100% against the spirit of the jam
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Practice is fine, giving you and your team an undue headstart isn't - ultimately it's up to you (and eventually to Mark) what side of that line you fall on
 Triggered#6897: What you are doing is totally fine IMO , its a way to practice and not make a a game/tool for upcoming jam
 redka#6365: imagine that happened during the jam, that's an hour off the time
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: As Theferalcarrot said I can't and won't judge if your exact tools go against the rules or not, I haven't seen them and don't have enough information. However this is as straight of an answer as I can give you. Its up to you to judge how you feel about your tools but certainly the way you talk about it makes it sound questionable.
It's your choice what you use and what you don't, that's not for us to police, we've already said that we won't make calls on edge cases. However this conversation has some up before, and you specifically asked me the question directly so I am providing my answer
 redka#6365: for example we found out i have no idea how to do collision detection properly in Godot, and so we spent an hour fixing my dumbass collision allocation
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: trying to practice before the jam seems like a reasonable thing to do, honestly
 redka#6365: it's an exercise in teamwork and problem-solving, and we can identify pitfalls and dangers we have as a team before they're happening during the jam
 redka#6365: yeah we're not going to use any of the content we make now, not the cubes, not the buttons, none of that, and that's why we make these
 Scolon#4218: Yeah that's exactly how I interpreted that rule
 Triggered#6897: I think the rule is pretty clear in itself
but when it comes to elaborating it in words thats gonna take quite a few pages
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Yep, I think the implication here is fairly clear but again, it's not like we can actually do anything about it - just say that it's kind of unfair to everyone else
 Redline#7370: I agree with that
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: So the spirit of the "you can use pre-made stuff" rule is basically as I've given as a suggestion before. Say 6 months ago you made a game with a first person character controller, and then when the jam starts you design a game that needs a first person character controller you can go back to that 6-month old game and take that code as a base. That is fine, you didn't know you needed it until you designed a game during the jam time and you happened to have what you need.
Making a bunch of tools especially for this "in case you need them" absolutely goes against the spirit of the jam. You are making code before hand for the jam regardless of whether you know for sure if you will use it or not
 redka#6365: yeah that's why we're making a game that's nothing like what we'll make during the jam, so we can't make specific tools, just general puzzle ones
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: If you're specifically making stuff for the jam beforehand, it's not really within the rules and absolutely against the spirit of them. Obviously we mods can neither judge your games nor stop you, but it's worth a reminder anyway
 Starch_Supreme#4835: 🔥
 RocketCow#5210: finally a reasonable opinion
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: godot's node hierarchy system really is so good it makes for such an interesting, modular paradigm. it's free and lightweight, so i suggest you give it a try!
 Scolon#4218: Yeah I also just have a collection of things I extract f rom old projects that I find I re-use A LOT
 Starch_Supreme#4835: scratch >> any other game engine
 dardasaba#9759: It's great :)
 samcox08#6606: I've never tried Godot, looks interesting.
 theChief#0001: Depends how much you're doing 😂 a whole template for a specific genre is too far IMO. I've got a couple of little tools like aim assist, ballistic trajectory, that sort of thing that I scrounge from old projects - I don't necessarily have anything in mind for them, just that they're tools I can use when the jam starts should I have an idea that can benefit
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: oh this looks awesome i need to get better at the engine... every time i get some amount of knowledge on an engine i feel like i stagnate at the early-intermediate level
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i mean the theme i know abt export variables lol
 dardasaba#9759: (at least that's what I meant, can't speak for others :P)
 dardasaba#9759: Yes but I think he mainly meant the colors and stuff
 Triggered#6897: Sorry but, what would be the harder way?
 RedTeapot#1960: The simplest way to do similar stuff is export variables - they show in the editor when you select the node containing the script. There might be more advanced things too
 dardasaba#9759: In the editor settings you can fully customize the theme
 redka#6365: Walrus, do you think that rule of "build solutions to abstract problems, don't use pre-coded content" is fair?
 dardasaba#9759: Me too, as you can tell from my picture :P
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: do you have any sources on making godot look similar?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I really like Godot
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: oh wow you really customized your interface huh
 redka#6365: yeah
 dardasaba#9759: Oh you changed the default theme?
 Zoro5168#0115: Ok
 redka#6365: Godot
 GodOfPro#7302: what engine is this ?
 theChief#0001: Tbh tools dev is one of my favourite parts of game dev
 Zoro5168#0115: What engine is this?
 redka#6365: in order to make it fair our game will not include button/cube based logic, because buttons and cubes is something we make now
 theChief#0001: Took about 6 hours but basically increased the amount of content we could make tenfold
 Zoro5168#0115: What if we make the redstone so as to remind us about the theme once were back at this point that would work
 samcox08#6606: 👍
 Triggered#6897: You gotta pay a price I guess
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i should spend some time making tools for my engine of choice after this jam so i get some experience with these. or hell why not try to make it a rule for myself to try and use tools this jam
 Zoro5168#0115: But to live through my cringy childhood will be hard
 redka#6365: i'm writing some notes in a document to encapsulate my thoughts
 Triggered#6897: Looks amazing!
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: hmm... makes sense, i guess i'm personally just not too experienced and that to me seems like quite a risk
 Triggered#6897: Technically time flies by, for you infinitely fast once,you are dead, since you are not waiting, unless of course you turn to soul then thats a problem
 redka#6365: if you know the data and the purpose of it, you can easily use tool scripts to get things going super fast
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: personally i'm going to try to learn the entire vector2 doc page for godot, because honestly, that is going to be really helpful to learn just in general
 theChief#0001: Oh wow absolutely, if you can - do. I write tools for pretty much every jam game I make! It speeds things up SO much ☺️
 redka#6365: well we did make majority of this test run in 20 hours total
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: nice effects
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: that's cool
 redka#6365: so we're gaining a better understanding of how to build dev tools when the jam starts
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: are you sure tool scripts are going to be relevant in a 2 day jam?
 Zoro5168#0115: Long way around i see
 redka#6365: for example this test project is meant to be "portals without portals and with various colored cubes", and we found out you can do cool stuff with tool scripts like this:
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: awesome that the game jam chat is getting to talk about What happens after the universe gets destroyed
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Ahh gotcha, fair getting to know your tools and your team work beforehand is definitely a good choice
 redka#6365: we're mostly testing the limits of engine functionality and efficiency of certain methods
 Triggered#6897: Great once thats done we die then after a long time universe will restart and then we will be bakc to our pasts
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Yeah, which is why if you had a game you'd made with a character controller and then you design a game that needs a character controller you can use it for sure.
I would just say be careful on that, doing a small practice to get to know the team is one thing but if you're using it as a secondary excuse to make tools you could use for the jam then that is straight up against the spirit of stuff.
I'm not going to judge if its ok or not, I can't see the stuff you make and I'm not the jam host. It just sounds like its really riding that line so go easy ok
 Zoro5168#0115: World might crash
 BadPiggy#5202: Engine might crash
 Triggered#6897: Multiply by -1 and done
 Zoro5168#0115: Genius
 Redline#7370: exactly
 Zoro5168#0115: What if we make the fps go negative will time flow backwards?
 redka#6365: think of it as a practice run
 redka#6365: it helps us realize our potential, pitfalls and what we might want to watch out for in jam proper
 Redline#7370: the goal is to reach fps so low, that it underflows into really large fps number, making you time travel ahead
 redka#6365: we barely know each other as a team so we're building some random portal-esque stuff together
 Scolon#4218: Adding different control schemes for a game jam game might use up too much time though
 Zoro5168#0115: Oooooh u like challenge
 BadPiggy#5202: Just add different control schemes. That's about the only accessibility most people care about.
Apart from any visual impairments though
 redka#6365: say we make something that lets us do stuff we'd spend 5 hours on in 15 minutes, then we'll try to reuse that
 Redline#7370: just redstone
he was so confused
 Scolon#4218: Im just happy my webgl build times aren't years long anymore
 Zoro5168#0115: With redstone and command blocks
 redka#6365: we might use some of it if we find it like, crucial to our process
 redka#6365: not so much tools as doing some digging
 Redline#7370: let's make a minecraft time machine yeeeeeeeaaaa
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: So you are making tools in advance for the game jam?
 JuliusCube#8501: well yea
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: color recognition can be problematic for colorblind people, though, so it's better to go for shape recognition
 samcox08#6606: I want to add accessibility for my game. I've not done so before.
 redka#6365: it's a very simple addition and it makes the game more enjoyable
 Zoro5168#0115: If u Go back in time and touch yourself ull explode atleast thats what physicists say
 redka#6365: for example, we've now realized that a really nice way to add accessibility to a game that relies on color or shape recognition, is to add some labels with text
 JuliusCube#8501: yeah id rather not turn into antimatter just to go back in time after going forward in time
 redka#6365: yeah we're making a game to test our workflow and get a better idea of what we'll need to make
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: the concept had legs but i got too caught up in trying to add very unnecessary stuff like a save system
 DrNukeLear#2414: It’d be even funnier if it was Time Travel
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i made a twin stick shooter inspired by metroid aesthetically where you have to balance temperature using different shots; fire shots  and ice shots, and going either too cold or too hot would start depleting your health
 Zoro5168#0115: Time to go hack the youtube servers
 theChief#0001: ahaha nice!
 Scolon#4218: Reminder that 70% of entries are going to be very similar in interpretations and you  shouldn't be worried *that* much about originality. Don't spend too much time thinking about the theme
 Triggered#6897: You get fever if too hot and or cold if too cold
 Redline#7370: it would be so funny if someone would somehow download the premiere theme reveal video before the premiere, and knew the theme
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: this is EXACTLY what i did!
 BadPiggy#5202: All themes are easy to implement if you just shoot-to-move
 theChief#0001: this is an interesting one - I'd probably implement this as some sort of "overheat" function on the character - with hot and cold weapons to balance your temperature
 cathy#3897: thats pretty good
 Zoro5168#0115: Pants
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: kind of a whatever theme honestly but still proud of what came out of it
 Redline#7370: no shoot to move
 Tapu#9161: Just make a shoot to move game and you'll be done
 Triggered#6897: Shoot to move
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: the last theme i played with was kind of a bit restricitive, it was something to do with "temperature is important"
 Scolon#4218: wdym easy-to-implement?
 samcox08#6606: I'm hoping to get a relatively easy-to-implement theme.
 Triggered#6897: Its just like exams everything seems easy once u are out of room
 Tapu#9161: Never in my life have I liked a game jam theme before time has run out
 Tapu#9161: A lot depends on the theme
 Triggered#6897: Shot in the dark
 Scolon#4218: Last time I particpated I got #491 in overall, and I slacked a lot on the game... doing a lot of stuff last minute
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: basic music theory isn't too hard to learn; there's a 30 minute by andrew hwang that's pretty useful
 samcox08#6606: I'm not really used to 8-hour dev days.
 Zoro5168#0115: Next year im aimin for top 500 this year im not aiming
 Sherbert Lemon#8177: otherwise it is just stress
 Redline#7370: no we are learning how to make music with an other member
 Sherbert Lemon#8177: crunch can defo be fun but you need to have a lot of free time for it to be enjoyable
 JuliusCube#8501: no i will not use royalty free music
but ok ill join
 lilburlap#8480: That sounds like it'd be either kinda fun or just horrible if the programmers use different engines
 MolassesLover#4128: But I accidentally made a while loop so broken that it destroyed my Linux installation
 Scolon#4218: Yeah I just want to do better  than the last time I particpated... which should be fairly easy I think due to how long ago that was lol
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: im absolutely not crunching for the game jam lol that's just going to hurt the end product and the end me
 Redline#7370: get in my discord server I'll take care of that
 Zoro5168#0115: Good
 MolassesLover#4128: I'm learning a new engine so I can use it for this jam
 JuliusCube#8501: im actually practicing for this jam which is a rare thing for me to do. im practicing making music because im garbage at doing that.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Don't crunch during game jams, get sleep, eat well, take breaks
 Triggered#6897: Imagine a jam where the devs. Of top 10(or any other no.) game are then tasked with creating a game that combines all of the top 10 games
 MolassesLover#4128: The theme should be cats and if it isn't I'll cry
 samcox08#6606: That's true.
 JuliusCube#8501: sleep deprivation, forgetting to eat, that one gamebreaking bug that appears 47 hours into the jam and wont go away.
 BadPiggy#5202: I thought those were the joining conditions
 MolassesLover#4128: Yeah that's why it'd be fun to make a game about it, you can bully the concept of NFTs
 Redline#7370: wait NFT can't be a theme because it means: **NoFuckingTheme**
 BadPiggy#5202: *While jammin to some jams
 theChief#0001: I think energy use is a drop in the water compared to the rest of the underlying issues with the tech 😛
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: People have different goals for the jam as well. Some people genuinely want to win, some people want to get top 1000, some people want to do better than they did the year before, some people want to finish a game, some people want to see how far they get, some people want to hang in the discord and give help to others.
There's a lot of reasons people join
 Zoro5168#0115: I thought u were bout to say stress,sleep deprivation,etc.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i think they mean "you could make a game criticizing nfts"
 RocketCow#5210: yeah, so why not make a game about *that*?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: while jammin to some tunes
 samcox08#6606: I'm not a fan of NFTs for their energy use.
 BadPiggy#5202: An insatiable thirst to Jam
 Zoro5168#0115: Side effects include?
 RocketCow#5210: why? Could make it a teardown of NFTs. I could have fun with that theme.
 MolassesLover#4128: Roblox theme
 BadPiggy#5202: Complementary game jam jam
 theChief#0001: in the form of internet cookies! Courtesy of itch.io, just click the "stay logged in" button 🙂
 samcox08#6606: I'd be out in an instant.
 JuliusCube#8501: na the theme is pants is for losers
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: do game jams:
-for the free food they give you at the beginning
-nothing else
there will be free food, right
 RedTeapot#1960: Never Fry Tacos?
 theChief#0001: ratings are open to the public, so even if you can guarantee that a few people who like the genre will play - you might still end up with 100 people who don't like the genre of game you end up making 😂
 Zoro5168#0115: Yes thats what i mean someone will rate u 5 stars even if u have the shittiest game so ith harder to lose
 Redline#7370: how about no.
 MolassesLover#4128: What if the theme is NFTs
 JuliusCube#8501: do game jams:
- for yourself, you learn from game jams
- for others, you can make a great game for others
- and for winning i guess but the first and second are more important imo.
 Zoro5168#0115: Just let me dream man
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Mark Brown
 Scolon#4218: Well you can somewhat control who plays your game by being active in here 😳
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: they could be zoidberg...
 Redline#7370: no because some galaxy brain meme wizard would definetly rate all 5 stars *for the memes*
 RocketCow#5210: They could be you. They could be me! They could even be-
 MolassesLover#4128: I'm not going to win but I'll do my best
 JuliusCube#8501: you never know there could be someone who thinks nfts are good lurking here anywhere
 theChief#0001: yeah but you're not gonna 😂 there's a ton of luck involved with placing high in game jams. Skill will get you in the top 20% pretty consistently, but anything beyond that tends to be down to:
- who plays your game
- who doesn't play your game
- what games the people who played your game played before they played your game
- what the other games in the jam are like
none of which you can control!
 Zoro5168#0115: Winning id say cuz i can just upload an empty project but ill need luck to be dead last meanwhile i can climb up to the win through skill
 BadPiggy#5202: Correction, you'll be disqualified so you won't even place
 RedTeapot#1960: Metaverse Blockchain NFT Crypto game for more lastness
 Squishy Turtle#3988: this is why working solo can actually be a huge advantage
 RocketCow#5210: An NFT game that actively insults the user.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: not really you could just submit something that doesn't compile
 Scolon#4218: NFTs 💀
 MolassesLover#4128: Just make an NFT game and you'll be dead last
 samcox08#6606: My projects have always been small scale mini-game type.
 BadPiggy#5202: Actually , dead last is usually shared by like 100 games
 RocketCow#5210: *somebody* would upvote malware.
 Scolon#4218: I've been working on a large-scale project for a while now and improved a ton, so this jam will be interesting to evaluate where my skills are currently at
 RedTeapot#1960: Winning: 20 places
Dead last: 1 place
It speaks for itself
 MolassesLover#4128: Being dead last vote would require you to write malware 100%
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: One of the things that leads to good games is just knowing what you are making. If everyone involved knows the core of the game's themes and what the player experience should be it's much less likely to get bloated and confused because everyone knows what they are aiming for and once they achieve the experience they wanted they know the game is finished
 Zoro5168#0115: Ik but it still feels good to win though
 JuliusCube#8501: well all they want is views and they got that from the 12 million 12 year olds who think that its actually good content.
im sure the people who make those videos are actually talented but the way they do everything is obnoxious and annoying
 Redline#7370: ok bois which one is harder, winning the jam or being dead last vote now bois
 RedTeapot#1960: No, I'm gonna take all the top 20 places
 theChief#0001: but for real this is not a competition lol
 Scolon#4218: bro I'm going to win by a landslide!!!!!!!! what are you talking about
 MolassesLover#4128: I wish this were a thing teams with hundreds of people would more frequently do, scaling appropriately
 theChief#0001: what are you talking about I'm going to **__win this thing__**
 BadPiggy#5202: This lol
Managing expectations
 Zoro5168#0115: Yeah like being stubborn about a small bug which isnt getting fixed
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: all the best performers paced themselves and kept their expectations reasonable
 JuliusCube#8501: my brain is like "oh you should make this game it would be so fun" and then like a day later be like "you should try solving the riemann hypothesis or do whatever and abandon this game its getting boring."
 MolassesLover#4128: I think stubbornness is a double-edged sword. If you're capricious about the wrong things then you'll 100% screw yourself over
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: From prior experience, the people/teams who crunch really hard and don't sleep either end up shipping something hideously buggy or burn out about 40 hours in
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: what store do i get it in and is it free
 RiverDog#8199: Stubbornness is finally an asset!
 RiverDog#8199: lol
 RocketCow#5210: god I *hate* those with a passion.
 MolassesLover#4128: Omg I hate typos
 theChief#0001: one of the most valuable skills in game dev is stubbornness 😉
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Exactly, much less.... like not at all
There's a reason that we always mention sleeping, eating and taking breaks in the jam advice and why we don't allow jokes like "if you sleep during the jam you're not dedicated enough" because while the person saying it might be joking, there's a LOT of people who actually get told that for real and who believe it and we want to shut that shit down
 Zoro5168#0115: Thats so relatable. Like deadlines are necessary
 MolassesLover#4128: If you had 400 people working on a game such as OMORI with just as much time, proper pay, and a healthy work schedule; you would absolutely have a better game than if it were made by basically two people
 Scolon#4218: People underestimate the value of proper project management
 RiverDog#8199: two days, lets say two working days so 8 hours.  Even if the Project Manager had his pick of who he wanted on it he would still have access to 6,400 working hours of experts
 JuliusCube#8501: for me this is too true, i literally never am able to finish a game outside of a jam. I always lose motivation and start working on another project
its like this for everything which is annoying but theres nothing i can really do about it.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: one thing is for sure, pay your game devs well and give them reasonable shifts that aren't over six hours
 Redline#7370: I'd like to see GTA 6 made in a month
 RocketCow#5210: I don't think you can nail down game quality to a single factor like that. Between the *right* amount of time, the *right* amount of manpower, the *right* budget, good management, good core design, so many things can make or break a game.
 MolassesLover#4128: Team size doesn't correlate with quality only because large teams are in capitalist companies with a primary insensitive of profit. This isn't always the case, and when it isn't we get an amazing game like Breath of the Wild
 BadPiggy#5202: I think it's more like constrained but reasonable time = better game
 Scolon#4218: Setting deadlines is important yes
 JuliusCube#8501: agreed
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: even with more time that's not necessarily true. Endless time often leads to feature creep and you're less likely to even feel finished if there's no end goal
 theChief#0001: not necessarily - I bet there are people that have such creativity that they make a better game in these 48 hours than I'll manage for the rest of my life 😂
 samcox08#6606: But yeah I think we should rely on crunch much less in the industry.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: and more people mean more consistent results over a greater amount of time
 JuliusCube#8501: more effort = better game
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: exactly
 Redline#7370: it's more like: **more time = better game**
 RocketCow#5210: I don't think a 400 member team could produce *anything* even semi-coherent in 2 days...
 Scolon#4218: Yeah there isn't a correlation between team size and game quality
 BadPiggy#5202: Not talking about game jams here, just in general lol
 JuliusCube#8501: modded what? the laws of physics? you know you shouldnt be ||messing around with time-travelling black holes and your scout in the high energy lab like that!|| (outer wilds spoilers)
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: yesterday someone said a triple A 400 members team would win and i dont think it would honestly, because it would be a nightmare to manage and connect the separate parts in the space of 2 days. triple A communication doesn't happen over a discord DM group it happens in daily meetins reporting progress
 Reemus#7953: Not by default, but there is a philosophy there, not a solution how to make a "good game".
 Shimp#0064: Pfp checks out
 Gammed#7543: megaman x2
 Redline#7370: yes
 SlamBamActionman#7160: i uuuuh modded it
 BadPiggy#5202: I disagree. Large team != Good gaem
 Reemus#7953: If people could get together and make bigger better games, everyone would be happier... except the market.
 Reemus#7953: Too many games being made, too little quality in them.
 MolassesLover#4128: I'm sure unions and future legislators will make an end to that stuff
 samcox08#6606: Yeah, it's a shame.
 BadPiggy#5202: Unfortunately I doubt that will happen
Same with naughty dog
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: rockstar needs to stop with the crunch lol
 JuliusCube#8501: hey, why is the interloper's orbit circular, shouldnt that violate one of keplers laws of planetary motion?
 Redline#7370: so based
 Zoro5168#0115: I used to play bully when i was 6 yrs old.it was my favourite game in the ps2
 MolassesLover#4128: Rockstar needs to go back to being Rockstar
 samcox08#6606: I agree. I'd really like a new Midnight Club game.
 BadPiggy#5202: Rockstar needs to go back to making beat-em-ups like Bully and the warriors
 JuliusCube#8501: i have 450 hours in it and also have found multiple glitches in it. So i guess im a mega outer wilds nerd
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i still need to get to outer wilds
 MolassesLover#4128: It's a small world
 BadPiggy#5202: Oof. Bully was amazing. I actually played this a few months ago
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Haha awesome, cool to be recognized
 JuliusCube#8501: yes, im a big outer wilds nerd
 Zoro5168#0115: Botw and bully maybe
 JuliusCube#8501: that was you? cool
 MolassesLover#4128: For me picking a favourite was so easy after I finished playing through OMORI
 theChief#0001: I've legit played over 5,000 hours of skyrim and I am not proud of this xD
 BadPiggy#5202: Hades oof. Loved the combat in that
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: I've been well into Banished recently. By playtime, probably Civ 6?
 JuliusCube#8501: ah a fellow outer wilds enjoyer. favorite planet?
 Zoro5168#0115: Pickin 1 is pretty hard
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: one day i'll 100% it. just need to get all godeln strawberries now
 JuliusCube#8501: is a good game
 theChief#0001: hades probably, but boy do I always come back to skyrim!
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Outer Wilds, probably
 MolassesLover#4128: OMORI
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: celeste
 BadPiggy#5202: Ban
 RedTeapot#1960: What if I say Minecraft?
 Zoro5168#0115: Idk any website which starts with dom
 BadPiggy#5202: Anyway ......
What are y'all's favourite games ?
 Redline#7370: everyone spam da button
 RedTeapot#1960: Gotta use Let's Encrypt yeah
 theChief#0001: that project is probably completely dead now, sorry 😭
 theChief#0001: huh
 theChief#0001: uh oh, links dead
 JuliusCube#8501: yeah uh i dont think http://domharris.uk/ld works anymore
 BadPiggy#5202: Dwelling on it only cus I missed someone getting YEET-ed
Damn
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: When something happens in chat, please don't dwell on it. It's been dealt with, let's move on 👍
 BadPiggy#5202: F
 Zoro5168#0115: That guy was tryna speedrun ban any%
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: someone said a slur and got what should be expected, nothing out of the ordinary
 BadPiggy#5202: Who got a YEET ?
 RedTeapot#1960: I missed it oh no
 BadPiggy#5202: Ban ?
 JuliusCube#8501: ok good you did it
 theChief#0001: done 😛
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394:  - too quick for me
 Redline#7370: my fastest speedrun of my 3 day long jam game is just under 5 minutes
 Scolon#4218: ban
 Zoro5168#0115: Ok
 BadPiggy#5202: AAARRGGHG BLOOM
 samcox08#6606: It wasn't good, but I had no game dev experience and I wasn't well at the time.
 JuliusCube#8501: id like to beat that. wheres the link?
 Triggered#6897: U know what lets call in any% and see how long it takes them to beat our jam games
 Zoro5168#0115: Gnight humans here
 DrNukeLear#2414: I have team looking for 2D coder
 BadPiggy#5202: Anything more and it loses steam
 samcox08#6606: I'll admit I did the same for last year's jam.
 BadPiggy#5202: Frankly, your jam game shouldn't go beyond 5 mins for the main content
 Nobody6502#8971: Good morning (humans?)!
 JuliusCube#8501: i have a jam game thats like 30-45 minutes of playtime but can be beaten in 4 minutes
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: my first day was a seven day jam that resulted in a pretty neat twin shooter metroid inspired game
 theChief#0001: most of my jam games can be finished in < 2 minutes 😛
 BadPiggy#5202: Nothing wrong with only one level
Look at devil daggers kek
 Zoro5168#0115: Business will be boomin
 Zoro5168#0115: About how the hermit was collecting the shells of his dead friends and family
 Triggered#6897: So is the one I talked about its called switch it it has like only one level lol
 Zoro5168#0115: Quick put a whole ARG into that game like every other new horror game
 BadPiggy#5202: It was my worst game lol
 woofl#2379: Thank you anyway, teapot
 Triggered#6897: What? Why?
 RedTeapot#1960: 
 Triggered#6897: Crash after the cutscene
Hmm sounds like there room for a sequel
 woofl#2379: BST 2D artist looking for a coder (daily 1/1)
 BadPiggy#5202: My first game jam was GMTK 2019.
I deleted that game from itch io a few days after the jam
 Redline#7370: bloom can cure that
 samcox08#6606: I worked on a volleyball game for my first game jam.
 snuffysam#2767: my first jam was a global game jam... the theme was Home i believe, and we decided to make a game about a hermit crab trying to stack bigger shells on top of itself
but i had to leave after the first day because a friend was in town only for one day
my first finished jam was Github Game-Off - the theme was moonshot, and i only found out about the jam two weeks in. but i managed to get a decent game down, that crashes after the final cutscene lol
 RedTeapot#1960: My first jam was very meh because I was in a team with a guy who convinced me to repurpose my old game for that. Didn't like it at all kek. The second one was kinda meh too but at least it was a new game. The third one (several years later) was GMTK 2020 lol
 BadPiggy#5202: Honestly, after the jam is over, I'll need to come here for both mental and emotional support
 Scolon#4218: Remember to come here for tech support :)
 Zoro5168#0115: But then i came 30th out of 80 so i was happy
 Zoro5168#0115: I spent 6 hours on a FUC***G BUG
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: It's normally a pretty great opportunity for a takeaway though
 snuffysam#2767: yeah it's just gonna be me there lol... i'm in the middle of traveling when the jam happens
fortunately i have enough time off to do the whole jam without interruptions
 Redline#7370: kid named several people
 Triggered#6897: I still remember my first jam ever it was mix and game jam1 and I made this game where for the first time of my life **I IMPLEMENTED A UNIQUE MECHANIC WITHOUT TUTORIAL ALL ON MY OWN** one of the best feeling
Share yours I would love to hear your first jam story
 Scolon#4218: I love work
 samcox08#6606: I have a relaxed mentality with the Jam. I wake up, work and then sleep.
 DrNukeLear#2414: Or one person named “Several People”
 Zoro5168#0115: Everybody typing then deleting there message cuz they dont know uf they should send it
 Gammed#7543: Hi!
 snuffysam#2767: could be worse, it could be people posting "*several people are typing*" and no other message
 Zoro5168#0115: Peanut butter jam sandwich with my game jams
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: I have _got_ to organise a Global Game Jam session one year - the mental image of a hotel buffet breakfast full of jammers would be such Chaotic Good energy
 samcox08#6606: I just do my usual routine.
 snuffysam#2767: i'm gonna have a mediocre hotel continental breakfast lol
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: I normally up my coffee intake, but I don't have any other routines like that
 Scolon#4218: Just come back on jam day where it's just constant *several people are typing*
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: So, to break out of the cycles of 'rip chat' - do you have a normal breakfast during jams, or do you do anything special?
 Zoro5168#0115: I was reffering to
 Zoro5168#0115: Dude its been more than 30 minutes please forget that i was dumb back then
 snuffysam#2767: there's like. a weird entitlement in complaining about nobody chatting.
"why isn't everyone entertaining me? sure, i don't have anything interesting to talk about either, but it's probably just because everyone else forgot about this chat"
also, who complains about a chat that hasn't been posted in for 5 minutes?
 Redline#7370: no, not allowed
 Zoro5168#0115: I have been wait here for 30 minutes and its finally revived
 Scolon#4218: I'm dragging you to the bathroom then
 Zoro5168#0115: I did not
 Scolon#4218: We just all simultaneously went to the bathroom at the same time
 Zoro5168#0115: Then ill make it
 Scolon#4218: The chat never died
 Zoro5168#0115: Then you may die
 samcox08#6606: I'm just here to revive the chat.
 Scolon#4218: Hello
 samcox08#6606: Hello.
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: yeah you're right guys this is so much better than a dead chat
 Scolon#4218: no
 Zoro5168#0115: *pulls out glock*
 Redline#7370: let's make it even more dead
 Lyfe#8258: I remember there being a Google drive link or smth for it
 R2D2Vader#0693: I assume this is gamemaker 1.4? cause gms2 is overpriced and now on a subscription model lol
 Lyfe#8258: Oh can someone repost the link for the GMTK animated logo that they released a year or 2 ago for people's splash screens
 Zoro5168#0115: Someone can be dead for last 3 minutes as well ded is still ded its a relative term comparitive to time if a particle lives for 1 nanosecond itll think were all so slow
 NoelJasik#8768: The chat has a stroke
 JuliusCube#8501: chat: *nobody messages in 3 minutes and is fully alive*
random kid: says "ded chat" *for literally no exact reason*
 Lyfe#8258: Fam it's been 3 minutes since the last message
 Zoro5168#0115: Ded chat
 theChief#0001: thought so 🙂
 snuffysam#2767: yup that's right. it's not a huge hassle, just go into the menu and uncheck the show warnings box
 theChief#0001: only in the game view right? I haven't done that for ages tbh 😂
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: just run c# code that handles rendering based on your own methods
 snuffysam#2767: yep, i've done that. though there's an annoying warning unity gives you that u have to turn off lol
 BadPiggy#5202: Ah lol
That makes more sense
 theChief#0001: or make your own render pipeline
 theChief#0001: you can blit a texture straight to the screen 🙂
 BadPiggy#5202: Wait wat ?.....
 theChief#0001: you don't even have to use cameras in Unity if you don't want to 😂
 BadPiggy#5202: This lol
My computer is a potato so I don't even use most of the in-built features in Unity
I just do whatever I can with what I can code out
 6iw#5835: This is good. I am currently working on the most difficult thing in the world, which is artificial intelligence
 NoelJasik#8768: Yeah I agree, though I enjoy programming more than I did in the past, I am still mainly in game dev to put my ideas into reality not to code
 theChief#0001: tbh I don't even think you _lose_ any sort of control with the major engines. You can always ignore the built-in stuff and roll your own solution. I have written a bullet hell engine that doesn't even use _gameobjects_ in Unity, let alone the built in physics 😂
 Zoro5168#0115: Yes
 DrNukeLear#2414: Have you seen the “People Make Games” documentaries on Roblox. 70% fees aren’t the worst part.
 Zoro5168#0115: Same
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i had to work on a ncurses ASCII c game for a operating systems exam this year for college and honestly as atrocious as it was it was also fun. i can see how having c ontrol over every facet of how your game operates can be a major pro for someone
 DrNukeLear#2414: I’m with you there.
 NoelJasik#8768: 70% fees aren't fun
 theChief#0001: I have used Unity full time for the last 7 years. I can make a game in 30 minutes, would _not_ be able to do that writing my own engine 😂
 NoelJasik#8768: Only game engine hate I can understand, would be hate towards actual company that made it, like fuck roblox
 BadPiggy#5202: Just learn Monogame and make your own engine
EZ
 theChief#0001: just because that's the way _you_ do it doesn't mean that will fit everyone's purposes
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: including no engine. it comes down to personal preference
 NoelJasik#8768: And that's good for you
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i will literally defend rpg maker btw. every engine has its place i think
 Princent Vice#4280: Same thing happens with music software. Everyone wants to swear their DAW is somehow better than others
 BadPiggy#5202: This lol
 6iw#5835: In the past years, I have been programming games with code only, without using game engines
 Scolon#4218: Yeah at the end of the day it's mostly personal preference and the own skillset of the developer
 NoelJasik#8768: Tbh I don't understand why peapole get so damn attached to game engines and programming languages, you should use the tool that works the best for the specific task or you simply enjoy using the most, it's not like skills from one tool don't translate to the others
 Princent Vice#4280: Any and all engines can make great games
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I use Ogre3D to make my games.
 Zoro5168#0115: I dont do engine debates cuz i dont even know about other engines.ignorance is bliss
 BadPiggy#5202: Yeesh. Doesn't matter what engine you make your game in
Just maek gaem
 Reemus#7953: It would be best if people moved from low-functionality engines to high-functionality engines, if only for the overall quality of the games.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: which is why i find the fact that recently the trial went free on an unlimited time basis so good. game maker has been making very good steps in the right direction recently
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i personally find game maker a bit archaic in 2022 but it's still a solid engine with lots of reasons to get into. the ease of use is a great point - people who aren't too comfortable getting into the gritty bits of game dev and just want to make a simple game for example are perfect for something like game maker
 DrNukeLear#2414: We only have to implement them during unity/unreal debates
 6iw#5835: a right
 BadPiggy#5202: Never heard of it. Shall look it up
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Brute Force. Xbox Original. Old game.
 theChief#0001: what about them? 😂
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: this!
 NoelJasik#8768: What about conflict resolution solutions
 BadPiggy#5202: Bro force ?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: are you talking about pre-made engines? sure, custom made software is good - but it's also incredibly messy to deal with and it takes a long time to develop on its own. the reality is that whether custom made or not the gaming industry standard is to use engines, and if they come prepackaged and with so much functionality like unity, then not using them would just be stupid
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Brute Force was a good game.
 theChief#0001: easy is _very_ important!
 BadPiggy#5202: Not too much tbh.
Just gotta brute force sometimes
 6iw#5835: haha
 R2D2Vader#0693: bahaha gamemaker is probably not as good as the others even for 2d games but it's so *easy*
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: What about hardware solutions?
 theChief#0001: though I guess it depends on what you mean by a "software solution"
 DHacker#0154: Yes
 theChief#0001: both engines absolutely do provide software solutions
 6iw#5835: But it will not provide you with software solutions
 Zoro5168#0115: I never even thought of looking at other engines and went for it
 theChief#0001: learn it if you want to go into game dev for a AAA studio, otherwise it's best suited to large games made by teams and generally struggles with anything that a solo dev or small team _should_ be attempting.
That's not to say it _can't_ be used in those situations, but that's not what it's best at 😂
 DrNukeLear#2414: I did that when I had the UE4 prerelease
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: each engine is good at doing something in a particular way. unity is a good engine because it has a lot of tools, but it is fairly big of an engine and hard to run in lower end machines. godot is a good engine because it's lightweight and the paradigm of nodes and hierarchy is interesting powerful, but at the same time that whole paradigm can be hard to get used or you just don't like it, which is fine. game maker has really good functionalities for making 2d games but it's absolutely not the best for 3d games. each engines has pros and cons and acting like one is absolutely the best over the others ignores that certain things are better tahn others in different contexts
 BadPiggy#5202: ^
 theChief#0001: unreal is an industry tool, it is not a beginner dev tool
 Zoro5168#0115: Idk nobody does resarch i just saw Dani use it.i wanted to use ue4 but it was too heavy for my pc so i went for unity
 CodingLord#1012: I tried Unreal and I was surprised by the lack of good tutorials. It was very complex and had so much in it.
 6iw#5835: **Don't tell me move and the tiles talk about programming **
 theChief#0001: rendering, collisions, UI and input
 6iw#5835: I mean what is the easy thing they give you?
 DHacker#0154: Idk
 JuliusCube#8501: is it just me or is there more slowmode today than there was yesterday
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: most engines are good
 Zoro5168#0115: Cuz theyre famous
 theChief#0001: most people would disagree 😛
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: not to mention, both are free, and godot is open source
 CodingLord#1012: they have a lot of tutorials
 6iw#5835: not realy
 CodingLord#1012: because its most used i think
 DHacker#0154: Because they are good game engines
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: unity is a good solid engine and godot is a good lightweight engine with an interesting paradigm for development
 theChief#0001: because those engines are the easiest to get started with, and most devs on itch are newer devs who don't have the time/resources to deal with steam!
 MMG#7170: has it really been a year?? 😵‍💫
 6iw#5835: why all people in itch io using unity or godot -_-
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: honestly i add semicolons to my godot code lmao
 Merus#7019: but we are just (counts on fingers) 9 mods, and this server is going to get extremely crazy as the jam gets closer
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: If you use Java Streams with enough dedication, you might only need semicolon singular 👀
 snuffysam#2767: oh wait, i thought you said top *down* lol, not top performing
 theChief#0001: you actually also _don't_ have to put semicolons in your JS code 😂
 6iw#5835: well dane
 Merus#7019: patrons can send images, because at the point where you pony up actual money we assume you're probably not going to send anything vile and get banned
 CodingLord#1012: dont you put semicolons in most languages like C++, C#, Java?
 6iw#5835: lol
 Merus#7019: no
 birdstone#3073: i don't know about you all but COW is one of the best languages
 DHacker#0154: Ok thx
 Zoro5168#0115: Its like in it u dont use symbols u WRITE code like DIVIDE A FROM B THEN ADD C THEN SUBTRACT X instead of (b/a)+c)-a
 DHacker#0154: I personally don’t like JavaScript because you need to always put semicolons
 6iw#5835: role for send image (about Game Jam)
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i have a hard time judging programming languages because most of the time they're useful for different situations
 Scolon#4218: You can send links, but you can't embed anything
 CodingLord#1012: I always thought of Javascript for web development
 6iw#5835: i can send image here ?
 Scolon#4218: Kinda specific but ok lol
 Merus#7019: Objective-C is a bad language
 6iw#5835: Javascript is good in 2D world Game if you know 🙂
 snuffysam#2767: i feel like that's probably because it's easy to make physics that feel bad to control for a sidescrolling or 3D game, but top down is usually fairly simple for controlling
 Merus#7019: COBOL's not a bad language, it's just... not very powerful
 CodingLord#1012: yes you can
 6iw#5835: i'am using ** Phaser 3 ** ican ?
 Zoro5168#0115: A very bad language
 DHacker#0154: Yes what is that?
 Merus#7019: wait that's bad
 Merus#7019: the prize for the jam is _exposure_!
 unityAccount#7810: And a good piece for your portofolio
 6iw#5835: what's is that ?
 CodingLord#1012: you can use any language or engine that can be playable without external applications
 Zoro5168#0115: U can even use COBOL if u want
 6iw#5835: cool
 Scolon#4218: Besides if you make a top game you have a very high chance of being featured in mark's video
 Zoro5168#0115: Yes
 DHacker#0154: Yes
 6iw#5835: ** I can use Othre Lang not unity or godot **
** i use JAVASCRIPT I CAN ,?**
 DrNukeLear#2414: I get to keep them! Like in cages?
 Yollie#2239: Money is from chief
 DHacker#0154: Thx
 Zoro5168#0115: Some amount of Fame which can really be a starting point for game dev,expierience under hard deadlines
 CodingLord#1012: thats good
 6iw#5835: I don't care about money, I just want to enter your review
 Redline#7370: money is via donations from people when you win the jam 😎
 DHacker#0154: Do they give merch?
 CodingLord#1012: btw dont do it for money
 Scolon#4218: Besides if there were prizes I feel that would ruin the spirit of the jam and people would get faaaaar too competitive
 Zoro5168#0115: Merch
 dardasaba#9759: The real prizes are the friends you make along the way :))
 CodingLord#1012: education above all
 DHacker#0154: Yes
 Scolon#4218: It's just for fun and growth
 CodingLord#1012: Learnings and Experience
 6iw#5835: no money 🙂 ?
 DHacker#0154: Nothing
 Scolon#4218: Nothing
 6iw#5835: The winer in Jam Get what ?
Or do you ask the theme?
 DHacker#0154: Like what?
 Zoro5168#0115: Theme?
 6iw#5835: What's the Game Jam ?
 DHacker#0154: Hi
 6iw#5835: Hello
 Redline#7370: normal with some spicy optional hard challenges is probably the objectively best option
 Zoro5168#0115: Its from the data i collected right now
 DHacker#0154: I didn’t know that
 Zoro5168#0115: Thats a fair point
 Zoro5168#0115: 0 in 5 people go for easy games
 Scolon#4218: It's hard to keep things interesting when the game is way too easy
 Zoro5168#0115: It seems very less people go for easy
 DHacker#0154: Same
 Scolon#4218: I just go for a normal and fair challenge. Sometimes it's a good idea to include a hardmode for highly skilled players so they don't  feel the game is too easy though. But a badly done hardmode can come off as unfair and unfun
 JuliusCube#8501: i do mainly puzzle-y stuff so id say normal
 snuffysam#2767: i like developing things that are primarily tactical challenges
stealth games, puzzle games, turn-based, etc
 JuliusCube#8501: id love a huge boss keys-type video on outer wilds since thats my favorite game (and it could be considered a "metroidbrainia") (eg. going through where the player would go and what clues they would follow, etc.) but theres already that video on clockwork games so i dont think anything of that matter is that useful.
 Zoro5168#0115: Ok
 Redline#7370: easy would get boring quite fast for me
 Redline#7370: normal ofc, but sometimes hard is nice at the end of the game
 Teslobo#8274: Outside of boss keys and on the level I imagine there'd need to be a "hook" to the video
 unityAccount#7810: It was more about the depth of analysis than the video being part of Boss Keys
 Zoro5168#0115: Hey guys what kind of gameplay do you like going for like hard(skill based like rhythm games),easy(accessible to everyone),normal(fair challenge for all)
 Redline#7370: I read "megalovania" what's wrong with me
 JuliusCube#8501: well cuphead's not a metroidvania
 Teslobo#8274: All that comes to mind is the boss keys one but it's hard to make boss keys on cuphead I believe?
 unityAccount#7810: yes
 JuliusCube#8501: boss keys i presume
 Teslobo#8274: Which one about hollow knight?
 unityAccount#7810: I'd love a big GMTK video about Cuphead  (like the one about Hollow Knight) now that the DLC is out
 Redline#7370: omg it's the Mark guy!
 Zoro5168#0115: Ill try then
 Mark Brown#6982: i finished it yesterday! It's brilliant - they really out-did themselves with the boss designs
 CodingLord#1012: Well you can learn a lot from it. Its very hard
 Zoro5168#0115: I havent played cuphead
 JuliusCube#8501: i havent but it looks good
 CodingLord#1012: Has anyone played the Cuphead DLC
 Zoro5168#0115: Schrödingers cat
 Tapu#9161: Shoot to Move!!
 JuliusCube#8501: both probably
 CodingLord#1012: does that mean that you dont care about him or that you dont think he is annoying
 JuliusCube#8501: ill take that as something positive
 JuliusCube#8501: or actually anybody for that matter
 JuliusCube#8501: because i dont want mark thinking im incredibly annoying or something stupid
 JuliusCube#8501: i know but its kinda funny
ill stop now
 snuffysam#2767: i will say, constantly bringing it up probably doesn't help
 Zoro5168#0115: Mark always had a mark on this world
 CodingLord#1012: damn i didnt know that
 snuffysam#2767: i have plenty of ideas for games, i have ideas for games all the time
but it is against the spirit of the jam to use them
my plan is that i'm not mentioning any ideas to my teammate until the jam starts... sort of a spot check to prevent me from forcing a pre-decided game idea into the theme lol
if i'm alone with my thoughts, i tend to plan out entire games in my head... forcing myself to evolve my ideas with someone else's input will lead to a much fresher game
 JuliusCube#8501: shhh
im a better person now
 Zoro5168#0115: That guy who pinged 47 times
 JuliusCube#8501: then disappears
 Zoro5168#0115: 🤣
 CodingLord#1012: Mark exists all of a sudden 💀
 Zoro5168#0115: Oh hi mark
 Redline#7370: I don't want to make a platformer considering how the last one went
 JuliusCube#8501: hi mark
*mark immediately leaves as he realizes the discord creeper is here* /j
 Zoro5168#0115: But it makes me feel good to atleast put on a game than to end up witha mess filled with bugs (like i atleadt make a playercontroller if i know im going top down then modify it according to the theme)
 CodingLord#1012: Well competition does add a reward element, which makes us work better.
 Yamam#4861: oh ok
 theChief#0001:  is the best place for that 🙂
 JuliusCube#8501: 
 Scolon#4218: rival 😳
 Metrona#3133: ~~what if you have a rival that will help you grow or something~~
 Yamam#4861: any 2d artist want to team up for the jam?
 JuliusCube#8501: i feel like that should be true for all competitions
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: Either your past self, or the self-imposed limits of the person you have in your head
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: As with all game jams, the only person we recommend you compete with it yourself
 theChief#0001: not sort of, _entirely_ 😛 this is a game design challenge, a challenge in which you have to design and make a game in a short period of time
 CodingLord#1012: i have my exams from 18th 💀 \
 theChief#0001: it's not a competition!
 JuliusCube#8501: id say you should have a basic *idea* of what genre your game will be before you start the jam but no more
 CodingLord#1012: well sort of
 Zoro5168#0115: But i guess it makes it fair for newbies
 theChief#0001: you're supposed to make a game within the given time frame, that's the whole challenge!
 Scolon#4218: Wassup jammers
 JuliusCube#8501: mostly the second
 Zoro5168#0115: Yo
 theChief#0001: the first option is also against the spirit of the jam 😛
 CodingLord#1012: well the first option will save a lot of time
 theChief#0001: most people will be coming up with their idea based on the theme _after_ it is revealed! But there's nothing wrong with narrowing it down to a broad genre - e.g. I'm pretty sure I'll be making a top down shooter
 Metrona#3133: i want to join a team but am very afraid of not being good enough
 Zoro5168#0115: Got it?
 CodingLord#1012: Should you think of an idea and make a plan and then revolve it around the theme when its announced or Should you think of an idea after reveal of theme.
 Speg#9708: Yooo we back
 Triggered#6897: Can someone tell me the que. I would love to give it a try
 JuliusCube#8501: okay
 Zoro5168#0115: I can dm u the answer cuz im too lazy to type it out
 CodingLord#1012: Dont you rationalise the left side first
 Yamam#4861: any music producer free for the jam
 JuliusCube#8501: okay so actually what am i supposed to do, this is an equation with 2 variables on 1 side, so i only am able to get 1 in terms of another. Or maybe im just dumb and my self-taught brain doesnt know something
 Zoro5168#0115: Wait let me analyze your answer
 Zoro5168#0115: Correct
 JuliusCube#8501: ah okay im just dumb then i guess and have no idea what im doing
 unityAccount#7810: Like after you finish simplifying the left side
 Zoro5168#0115: a=2,b=5/6
 unityAccount#7810: Uhhh, I think he just needed the values of a and b
 JuliusCube#8501: a = 2+ 5 sqrt(6)/6 - b sqrt(6) (i could maybe simplify further but im too lazy)
b = -a sqrt(6))/6
 Zoro5168#0115: Chat alive
 CodingLord#1012: dead
 Zoro5168#0115: Ded chat
 Zoro5168#0115: Ok
 JuliusCube#8501: ik i was just doing something else cuz i got distracted
 Zoro5168#0115: Youre taking too long
 JuliusCube#8501: k
 Zoro5168#0115: Yes solve for a and b
 JuliusCube#8501: and im supposed to solve for a and b or something, or rationalize or simplify or whatever?
 Zoro5168#0115: Pretty easy one
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: the "won't be liked by many of the people here part" is because that someone is in Tech
 Zoro5168#0115: (Sqrt 2 + sqrt 3)/(3sqrt2-2sqrt3)=a+b×sqrt6
 JuliusCube#8501: just pull a robin hood and steal the entirety of spacex its as easy as that /j
 Yollie#2239: ~~you can get money from theft~~
 JuliusCube#8501: knowing the current state of whatevers happening in american politics, that means that your answer is probably "rich people" or some equivalent to that.
I am completely impartial on this subject so if anyone heres part of the "wont be like by many"  dont attack me
 Zoro5168#0115: Ok solve this
 Yollie#2239: Year 10 maths isn’t hard lmao
 Yollie#2239: That was my hardest one 💀
 Phallo#3476: that is actually the reason why ddr5 ram has built in requirement for it to be ECC (error correcting) because everything is happening so fast that there was just inherently a way higher chance of crashes to happen... and ECC makes it so it is actually a way less chance
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i know where to get the money from but the answer won't be liked by many of the people here
 JuliusCube#8501: nah i dont have enough... everything
everything here is intelligence money and also willpower
 JuliusCube#8501: or is that too much to ask for
 Zoro5168#0115: Solve world hunger
 JuliusCube#8501: yollie can i have another math problem from your homework since i have nothing to do
 JuliusCube#8501: yea
 Zoro5168#0115: Its just a fast space thingy which can flip a 0 to 1 or a 1 to 0
 Yollie#2239: I don’t understand fully but they’re bad for computers
 JuliusCube#8501: very fast proton from space that is
 JuliusCube#8501: basically its a very fast protron or something like that that intesects with the upper atmosphere creating a bunch of other very fast particles that flip bits and change stuff when they intersect with things in computers.
 Yollie#2239: Julius you’re genius gimme a rundown
 Redline#7370: noooooo he didn't watch *the* video
 Zoro5168#0115: Go watch veritasium
 Yollie#2239: I don’t know what cosmic ray is but it sounds like a weapon from a sci-fi video game
 JuliusCube#8501: well now because the transistors are smaller than they were 26 years ago its much more common for bit flips to happen. I dont think anything is a good metric except current-day data on how common cosmic rays are
 Coffe#5594: even then it took a lot of knowledgeable people to narrow it down to a ray
 Redline#7370: yes, that's more accurate
 snuffysam#2767: the issue is that it isn't just the odds of getting a cosmic ray, it's the odds of getting one on video lol
 Redline#7370: no?
 Coffe#5594: if we use super mario world instead the odds are 0%
 Coffe#5594: I don't think sm64 is a good metric
 snuffysam#2767: i think it would take on average 26 years running continuously for a program to be noticeably affected by a cosmic ray
since that's how long it's been since mario 64 came out, and we only know of one time on original hardware where a cosmic ray affected the game noticeably
 Tapu#9161: nope I messedup
 RedTeapot#1960: Although now that I think of it, the loop contains no variables, so the compiler should generate an unconditional jump there, so the only way to break the loop is to either screw the program counter register up or affect the jump instruction logic
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: 
 ZEST#7932: Anyone need a 2d pixel artist?
 Coffe#5594: you could probably also write better code so the ray is more likely to hit your condition rather than changing the instructions x)
 ZEST#7932: Hi
 BisectedBrioche#6824: To be fair, it would be far more likely if the machine was running in, space
 RedTeapot#1960: Hi
 RedTeapot#1960: In a loop this tight, the compiler probably will place all variables in registers. But I guess a ray can hit the register file at any time to change a bit
 Tapu#9161: Hi teapot
 Tapu#9161: Sorry misunderstood
 Coffe#5594: no the condition would most likely be stored in RAM and could be changed at any time
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: plus it would need to hit at the very moment that the machine code does the condition checking
 Tapu#9161: It would have to hit a very particular transistor to break the while loop
 JuliusCube#8501: very, very, long. because multiple cosmic rays have to do very specific things in order for that to work
 JuliusCube#8501: a random bluescreen may as well be caused by a cosmic ray tho
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: wondering what the average time for this to print would be then
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: interesting
 JuliusCube#8501: bit flips or cosmic rays?
bit flips happen pretty often, but not enough to cause a problem , cosmic rays occur everywhere and all the time
 JuliusCube#8501: but those alpha particles are often caused by other neutrons/protons (almost always protons tho bc free neutrons decay after ~15 min) and other stuff colliding withh air molecules
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: wonder how often these happen
 JuliusCube#8501: yeah it is
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: That do the bit flips I mean
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: it's mostly alpha particles I think?
 JuliusCube#8501: different things
gamma ray is only gamma waves, cosmic ray is anything from space that is a "ray" 
 Tapu#9161: I'm dumb 💀
 JuliusCube#8501: *cosmic ray
 Tapu#9161: ```js
// Coamic ray detector
while{}
console.log
```
 theChief#0001: pokemon 😛
 JuliusCube#8501: whats a porygon
ah the pokemon
 Princent Vice#4280: I have porygon 1,2, and Z cell phone charms
 theChief#0001: Angles, round duck, floaty boi
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i always get my porygon evos confused 😔
 RiverDog#8199: Chief says "So you want to make a 3D shooter great! Start with a 2d game with premade assets).  haha this is so true tho.  I made that 3d runner tutorial in 3d and since trying to do it all solo have slowly been regressing from 2010 tech to 2005 and now im at 1989 tech.  If i can make this 2d NES style game I will make and submit pong
 Yollie#2239: Oh there’s no programming
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i mean he does have a porygon2 in his profile picture i'd assume he'd be programmable
 Yollie#2239: I must be dreaming
 DrNukeLear#2414: We can program the Chief?
 Yollie#2239: THECHIEF PROGRAMMING TUTORIAL?
 RiverDog#8199: that is a good problem to have haha
 theChief#0001: As in, you have to work out the code yourself with Google
 theChief#0001: I'm working on an intro to programming tutorial myself actually 😂 there's a bit of unity specific stuff to help people get set up, but the rest of it has NO CODE, so it's pretty engine-agnostic
 GodOfPro#7302: brackeys
 DrNukeLear#2414: My problem with tutorials is I optimise their code as I go along and then just diverge from it entirely.
 Lawn#1538: Remind you of any one?
 theChief#0001: What you want is something where you see results _immediately_
 GodOfPro#7302: his voice is so calm lol
 epicman#3996: my people
 Lawn#1538: Yeah I got about half way, as is tradition.
 Mark Brown#6982: not Tom's fault, just my ADHD-riddled brain
 Mark Brown#6982: I did start following this but, like all tutorials, I bounced off
 Lawn#1538: Hiya, welcome! Check out the  if you’re looking to form or join a team. Lots of people looking for members.
 Lawn#1538: I’m pretty sure Mark or someone on the Patron side has recommended it
 Lawn#1538: I enjoyed this one by Tom Francis
 JuliusCube#8501: ones that arent about different topics that is
 Jolomoju#6021: Helloo everyone!! This is my third time in a game Jam! I generally participate alone, but If anyone wants to discuss some ideas and maybe even join me, I'm open to It! This is my profile: jolomoju.itch.io
 JuliusCube#8501: there is a brackeys tutorial on that
 Jeker#3389: nice
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: yup, sardinia
 Jeker#3389: yep, where are you from italy?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: oh shit a Greek person, fellow of the mediterranean
 GodOfPro#7302: does anyone have a more tutorial series for unity that creates a game ? brackeys videos are about different topics and it is a little hard to put them together as a game
 Jeker#3389: yeah, i know, but i cant register with my school email, cause its a special greek thing
 Lyfe#8258: I gotta say I kinda dislike the new version of github projects because for some reason it's not attached to the repo it's attached to your account/team, and also it defaults to a spreadsheet now instead of a kanban board
 DrNukeLear#2414: I may be there.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: that's one of the like. first things I learned during a jam. you don't have time to make all of the features you want. I got stuck making a three slot save system in a 7 day jam and it ate up like two entire days of dev work
 JuliusCube#8501: after reading the wikipedia article on the guy who made it, i agree
 Lawn#1538: You can get Rider for free with an educational license for like a year btw
 Jeker#3389: i am glad the jam is happening in like a week, cause now i can use rider with the free license lol
 Lyfe#8258: I was using github projects as well I knew I had other things to do
 Redline#7370: brackeys jam is like at the end of summer
 Lyfe#8258: I need to join more jams because 2 gmtk jams ago I got so distracted just doing art and failing to code a fairly minor part of the game that I didn't finish and just joined someone else's team to help them with finishing up
 Jeker#3389: why do i suddenly have so many ideas for a game, and i am sure none of them will fit
 Lawn#1538: If in doubt, read over the rules or ask here
 Lawn#1538: As long as you credit them appropriately.
 DrNukeLear#2414: You can. If I was you I’d release your unreleased game between now and the jam. You could then (if the theme fits) do a sequel using the jam.
 Team Bean#9886: Good, good.
 Lyfe#8258: Yeah you can use premade assets
 Team Bean#9886: Thamks
 Lyfe#8258: As long as you don't snitch on yourself lol but no it's not in the spirit of the jam
 Team Bean#9886: ?
 Team Bean#9886: But I can use pre-made assets right
 Team Bean#9886: Oh ok
 Cameron#7818: No. It needs to be made within the 48 hours.
 DrNukeLear#2414: No.
 Team Bean#9886: Let's say hypotetocally I made a game that I didn't release and it fit the theme could I upload that to the game jam?
 Lyfe#8258: I will make my game in pure html
 DrNukeLear#2414: That stuff is cursed.
 Jeker#3389: yeah heard of it
 JuliusCube#8501: theres one called "HolyC"
and its for TempleOS lmao
 DrNukeLear#2414: Yes
 Team Bean#9886: Can I ask you ppl something?
 JuliusCube#8501: yeah
 Jeker#3389: Is it ok if I post a wikipedia link here?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: or logic. just learned abt those in college
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: oh you do not know  about languages like o-caml and stuff. like it do you
 JuliusCube#8501: because there are things that just arent c-based at all
or are like python where they just do.... whatever python does
 Jeker#3389: I mean theres a whole category called "C-Styled"
 JuliusCube#8501: almost every language at this point is syntactically similar to c or c++ in a way
 Jeker#3389: C++ has made me get ptsd when i see ""
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: ahh. wondering if this applies to GML because that language is syntactically very similar
 Jeker#3389: C/C++
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: this is for what language?
 JuliusCube#8501: not that bad
could be worse
 Jeker#3389: ```c
#define SMALLCASE (((X)>='a') && ((X)<='z'))
```
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: also to be honest I did this just because I thought it would be funny in the moment lol
 Jeker#3389: Did you know, macros have a whole other syntax for them? Like, aside from the "#define x"
 JuliusCube#8501: macro syntax is not *that* bad
 Jeker#3389: I mean, something less readable than that, is macro syntax lol
 Lyfe#8258: I do not like
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: I just personally love it. it's clean and one line when you need a simple assignment with a condition
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: yeah
 Merus#7019: that's fine - sometimes the ternary operator can be cleaner, but the difficulty in reading it is a factor in why you shouldn't overuse it
 JuliusCube#8501: i feel like making a shoot to move game for this jam specifically because there will always be a shoot to move game in these jams and I want that to continue.
 Jeker#3389: I dont know, I guess i preefer clearer syntax
 JQ2#4402: Thanks then!
 JuliusCube#8501: no
 Jeker#3389: Am i, too weird for not really liking the ternary operator?
 Lawn#1538: Still, colour me impressed.
 Merus#7019: I'm fine with not working out an actual function for it for a prototype
 Jeker#3389: damn...thats...thats code for sure
 Merus#7019: that... is a strong candidate for a switch statement, and the paddle angle/40 probably should only be calculated once
 JQ2#4402: technically I'm using Android Studio with libGDX, so I only deserve partial credit
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: the code itself was for a paper mario esque attack paddle where the closer you get to the center the higher the damage, and this was for calculating the multiplier for it
 Lawn#1538: And mine
 Lawn#1538: You’re in for a heck of a week
 JuliusCube#8501: what the hell is this
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: in my defense this was for a prototype.
 JQ2#4402: Well lets see. Got the window, button, graphic, mouse and keyboard. Still need to stick in fonts, sounds, figure out logging, and make sure I can embed a JRE with the package on itch
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: ``var modifier = abs(paddle_angle)/40 < 0.1 ? 1.4
: abs/40 < 0.2 ? 1.1
: abs/40 < 0.3 ? 1.0
: abs/40 < 0.4 ? 0.9
: abs/40 < 0.5 ? 0.7
: abs/40 < 0.6 ? 0.5
: abs/40 < 0.7 ? 0.3
: abs/40 < 0.8 ? 0.2
: abs/40 < 0.9 ? 0.1
: 0``
 JuliusCube#8501: nested ternary operators would be a quick way to make your code unreadable as hell.
 JuliusCube#8501: im not scared of it
only others who look at the spaghetti that I call code are scared of it.
 Lawn#1538: Mornin’, how goes the engine?
 Merus#7019: very useful! but you can also do some unholy things with it
 JuliusCube#8501: ? and : okay
 Merus#7019: `boolean expression ? do this if true : do this if false`
 JQ2#4402: Morning folks! Happy Jam week!
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: hold on let me check if I can find a snippet of something I wrote once
 JuliusCube#8501: ternary operator?
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: Code? That needs to handle _more than one journey?_
I don't like the sound of this, I'm out
 Merus#7019: true mastery will come when you're once again scared of the ternary operator
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: before I was even half competent with  code I was confused even by the thought of the ternary operator and now I put it everywhere I can because it's awesome. and I learned by failing over and over again and learning how to use it
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: you gotta fail to learn
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Come on 
Welcome to the JAM!
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: which is still learning i guess
 Lyfe#8258: I don't even know why I have that nickname I think it was a meme from last years jam
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: i'd have thought a 48hr jam would push people to new heights of code mismanagement and illegibility
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: don't get burned out!
 Tapu#9161: The theme is "pants are for losers"
 Lyfe#8258: Though doing 4 days of straight coding might be too intense
 Lawn#1538: Hey another Slam
 Lyfe#8258: I forgor how to make game, so i might just do my own prejam jam when I get back home
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: hey, jams are useful to practice a number of skills, and team management/cooperation is absolutely one of them. i'm sure all of the four programmers are gonna get a lot of good practice in code management and legibility
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: My friend who I worked with in a previous Jam just assembled a 10 person team. Lol.
 Tapu#9161: Oh
 Wokarol#0940: Yep... that's still a fricking lot
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: It's my game studio I started up last year! We havent really done anything outside of game Jams, tho.
 Tapu#9161: Bye
 Lawn#1538: Byyye
 Lawn#1538: And that’s me folks.
 Lawn#1538: But interstellar.
 Lawn#1538: It’s a garden
 Tapu#9161: What's interstellar garden?
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Oh, sick!
 Lawn#1538: There’s a lot of them.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: The cult of the 11th
 Lawn#1538: Your level designer?
 Lawn#1538: Identified by saying “I’m in a 11 person team”
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Which one? Lol.
 Lawn#1538: We met one of your disciples earlier.
 Lawn#1538: Shadow the Team Lord.
 SaadTheGlad#9716: And the link emotes too :P
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: shadow DA hedgehog...
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: It's been the same for years! Lol.
 SaadTheGlad#9716: Hey! I do too! That pfp and name is memorable
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: I have a lot of problems with how people discuss issues of disability and accessibility in games, I have a significant other who's disabled and personally hates the whole idea of "accessibility means making the game easier and dumbed down" because accessibility isn't about like... making games easier, it's about making them easier to access and play for everyone. for example allowing button remapping and universal controller support is accessibility because it can help people who have issues with dexterity without making the game experience any different
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: General Kenobi!
 SaadTheGlad#9716: Hello there
 Lawn#1538: I had a decent chuckle
 DrNukeLear#2414: You too!
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: Oh i was responding to old messages lmao
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Welp imma go. Take care everyone
 Tapu#9161: 👖
 Cameron#7818: The Pant God?
duh
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Says who?
 Cameron#7818: I was about to point out that that was last year's theme already and we can't do Pants are for Loosers twice in a row.
 Merus#7019: I don't know if I'm a fan of drawing an equivalence between people who have disabilities, and people who are running a different operating system
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I played the magnet game and enjoyed being able to change the buttons. Azerty keyboard issues sometimes
 Tapu#9161: Yeah I remember
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: That one was a throwback to last year, if anyone remembers. Lol.
 Tapu#9161: Wine?
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Lmao
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I knew it!
||**PANTS ARE FOR LOSERS!**||
 Cameron#7818: Get a Windows VM.
Or maybe it works through proton or vine?
 Lawn#1538: You mean dozens.
 dardasaba#9759: I love how mark added accessibility even on small details like that but didn't make the game accessible to the millions of Linux users out there :(
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Yea. When it premieres
 Lawn#1538: From the top cat himself.
 Lawn#1538: There’s the theme right there for ya
 Tapu#9161: Early theme reveal, start making your games
 JuliusCube#8501: google translate says rice field
 Lawn#1538: I know nothing.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: ***is that the theme?***
 Cameron#7818: ta
 Tapu#9161: rice field?
 Lawn#1538: Opposites attract is a bit easier to sell than norths and souths attract.
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Yea.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: + and - is great for telling they're opposites faster and it makes it so you dont even need to know the english alphabet to understand it.
 JuliusCube#8501: i guess that makes sense
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: imagine i showed you this character た, would you be able to tell me what it is at a first glance?
 JuliusCube#8501: yes  but they are usually thought of as 2 different fields that just happen to have a lot in common in a big part of physics
 Lawn#1538: It’s a bit more universally understood than N and S.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: you have to think of people who might not even be able to read (young kids) or people who don't use the Latin alphabet in their language and aren't used to it
 JuliusCube#8501: even though thats for the electric force and not the magnetic force
 Tapu#9161: Electromagnetism
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: that's an acdessibility thing
 JuliusCube#8501: i find it funny how in untitled magnet game instead of marking the magnet with an "N" or an "S" (meaning north and south) mark marks the magnet with a "+" or a "-"
 dardasaba#9759: Bye!
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Cya
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: alright it's almost 2pm and i need to eat see you all in a bit
 JuliusCube#8501: ah makes sense
 dardasaba#9759: It's part of the disguise
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i have to convince you i'm on the side of those who aren't subbed yet, right?
 JuliusCube#8501: you havent subbed to the patreon though
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Would love to become a patron eventually.
 JuliusCube#8501: 
 FoxSake#0897: Heya everyone.. I am looking for team-mates for the Game jam... This is my 1st game jam :)
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: always next year, OR you become a patron
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Also I'm gonna miss this server when the jam is over.
 JuliusCube#8501: good morning person who is in an 11 person team
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I'm doing slightly better than yesterday.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I'm doing well, and yourself?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: bad morning to all gamers but good morning to all game devs
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: How's everyone doing today?
 Tapu#9161: sin90+icos90 is one
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Good morning, gamers and game devs!
 Princent Vice#4280: Thanks for the quick modding
 Lawn#1538: Beat me to it. So smooth.
 theChief#0001: Terminally online 👍
 JuliusCube#8501: fun fact: (-1)^(-i) == e^pi
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: no joking about stuff like that please and thankyou
 Redline#7370: hmm that was surprisingly fast
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: Damn you're fast :sanic:
 theChief#0001: Done
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: yep. already done
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: Given what Slam mentioned earlier, I'm FYI-ing the  in case it's a continuation of said
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: that was a very interestingly placed spoiler
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Hello
 JuliusCube#8501: i guess so, i dont really know how matrix multiplication and that stuff works so probably
 Alchemical_Moon#8853: No stop
 JuliusCube#8501: bonus challenge: give me 6 different ways of representing the number e^(i*pi)
why? no reason at all
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: hmm... does this count?
)- (Id3) = ((0,0,0), (0,0,0), (0,0,0)), where A is a 3 by 3 matrix
 caibi#2508: very cool, haha
 Alchemical_Moon#8853: 😢🤜
........0
 JuliusCube#8501: 0.000......0001 = 0 (the ...... here is infinitely many zeroes)
 caibi#2508: 0!+0!+0!=3
 JuliusCube#8501: just a bunch of zeroes? okay.
 Alchemical_Moon#8853: .......0
🥺🤌
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: You could always hide your multiplication with a dot product?
```{1, 0, 3}.{0, 4, 0} = 0```
You might want some funnier matrices tbh
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: (i totally didn't have to spend five minutes manually scrounging the ascii value table to do this)
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: boolean is a field of mathematics, so
 Alchemical_Moon#8853: ................0
👁️👄👁️🤌
 JuliusCube#8501: well, yeah. its the derivative of a constant
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: that count? assuming ascii value of course
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: " AND ]
 Alchemical_Moon#8853: What about mine
 theChief#0001: Needed addition for the last one 😉
 JuliusCube#8501: im accepting that solution
 Alchemical_Moon#8853: I did it
 caibi#2508: 0+0
 Alchemical_Moon#8853: ..................0
👁️👄👁️🤌
 JuliusCube#8501: not allowed to use same operation more than twice but other than that correct
 Redline#7370: *I'm pretty sure that's 5*
 Yollie#2239: 5
 theChief#0001: There you go, all six 😂
 theChief#0001: ```
0
1-1
1*0
0^1
Sin
e^ + 1```
 JuliusCube#8501: yeah it does
 Tapu#9161: Yes it's the magnitude of a null vector
 JuliusCube#8501: is that the magnitude of a vector of size zero? if so it does
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: data structure and algorithms friends understand this
 caibi#2508: well! programers are talking about something I hate.
 Tapu#9161: Not sure if the last one counts
 Alchemical_Moon#8853: Did I do a math?
 JuliusCube#8501: e^(i * pi) = -1
 Redline#7370: yes I agree with that one
 Alchemical_Moon#8853: 0#+(89)0!;xy, x 7654$$+^ = 0
 Tapu#9161: 0+0=1-1=0/2=3*0=sin0=|vec0|
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: Euler's formula is `e^(i pi) = -1`, it's amazing
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: 0
1-1
2^2 - 2^2
2^n - 2^n
n^n - n^n
n! - n!
here you go, higher and higher complexity each time : )
 JuliusCube#8501: its true
 Yollie#2239: What in the actual hell
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: `e^(i pi) + 1` ?
 theChief#0001: Wait
Damn it you're right
 Redline#7370: read it 6 times
 caibi#2508: make a game like *The Stanley Parable* maybe work for me lmao
 JuliusCube#8501: 1^0 and 0! are not equal to 0 btw
theyre equal to 1
 Yollie#2239: Redline can’t count
 Alchemical_Moon#8853: I do have team management experience
 JuliusCube#8501: __***6***__ different ways
 theChief#0001: 0
1-1
1*0
1^0
Sin
0!
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: above 7 you need a team manager with chops, and above 13-15 it gets too complicated to manage everything
 JuliusCube#8501: imo the ideal jam size is 1 because i have no friends
 Redline#7370: x - x = 0
 BadPiggy#5202: That's what free lives does lol
 Tapu#9161: Even if such a large studio joins, they'll probably just break up into smaller teams and have some kind of in house competition
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i think the ideal team size for a jam is 4-7 people
 Yollie#2239: Or they’d make a banger
 DrNukeLear#2414: I’d love them to try to make a decision about game design in 48 hours.
 BadPiggy#5202: The last thing we need is AAA Devs coming into jams
Then gamers will start to pour into jams
And then everything goes to pot
 JuliusCube#8501: daily "math" problem #2:
give me 6 different ways of representing the number 0, each time with higher and higher complexity. you may not use the same operation/function in more than 2 representations of 0.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i think that wouldn't go well, legitimately. that short amount of time makes it probably extremely difficult to coordinate work between so many people
 caibi#2508: I know how to make 3d model, just not good at texture, maybe the game just full of white is a characteristical of the game.
 Alchemical_Moon#8853: They'd prolly have a worse project than four homies from across the world ngl
 Tapu#9161: Imagine them making up half of the people joined in a small community jam
 Yollie#2239: It’ll be *funny*
 BadPiggy#5202: Pls no
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: i assume there's a limit to the number of collaborators you can add to a page on itch but i don't know what it is
 Alchemical_Moon#8853: This will be my 14th jam
 Yollie#2239: I kinda wanna see like an AAA company join some random jam and bring like a team of 400
 Alchemical_Moon#8853: Can do music and pixel arts
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: last inactive project i learned that i need to do some research before i try emulating mario galaxy type gravity!
 Tapu#9161: Unlimited
 Metachii#9203: Team members number for the jam?
 theChief#0001: Tbh I did learn things in pretty much all of them I think - most are intended to be abandoned
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: the true signifier of an active programmer... the greater the number of inactive projects, the better...
 Aiminer357#8033: oof. consider myself offended
 Yollie#2239: I’m pretty sure that’s higher than what I can count to
 JuliusCube#8501: it would be reversed
-eilloyoyoy
 Yollie#2239: I would say something really rude right now but that might be against the rules
 theChief#0001: Ahahaha my project graveyard has more than 300 abandoned projects in it 😂
 theChief#0001: I tend to just use simple shapes and post-processing, all of my animation is done through code 😂
Audio takes a lot of looking through free/paid sites or finding a composer with 
 Aiminer357#8033: meeting someone new that you recognize means theyre not new
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: 20 inactive godot projects
 Tapu#9161: -Yoyoyollie?
 JuliusCube#8501: become negative e
 Tapu#9161: What if you run out?
 Yollie#2239: Every time I meet someone new that I recognise I will remove one letter from my nickname
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i have like one active project in a prototype phase andddddd
 Yollie#2239: Bruh when chief has more active projects than all your projects
 JuliusCube#8501: or a skateboarding trick
 theChief#0001: I currently have more than 10 active projects at work, yeah this is super important 😂
 Yollie#2239: Alright, alright
 Tapu#9161: Untill he becomes E
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: ollie is just like a nickname for someone named oliver or olivia
 Tapu#9161: We'll keep removing one letter from his name
 JuliusCube#8501: you are a skateboarding trick now
 Yollie#2239: Ollie sounds like a bug so nah
 Redline#7370: you are ollie from now on
 Yollie#2239: 😭 😭  I’m being forgotten
 Tapu#9161: Yeah I remember you but not ollie
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: yeah if you're doing anything longer term than a week your code needs to be manageable for everyone in your team and for your own sake. i've taken breaks from projects due to college and went back to them completely baffled by what i wrote
 Yollie#2239: YOOO the brackeys jam group has expanded
 JuliusCube#8501: i doubt it i dont remember yollie being in that one
 Tapu#9161: Yes
 Yollie#2239: I wasn’t in that, did you do brackeys jam 2022.1?
 JuliusCube#8501: same
 Tapu#9161: Probably 2021 gmtk jam
 JuliusCube#8501: id say otherwise but sure okay
 Yollie#2239: Oh I remember you from
Which jam was it
 Aiminer357#8033: readability is important too
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: you'll learn the programming applied to the context of unity
 Redline#7370: best way to learn unity is watching every brackeys tutorial, you don't even need to follow it
 Yollie#2239: But don’t switches compile to if else chains anyways
 Tapu#9161: *Proceeds to ignore all the infinite loops*
 JuliusCube#8501: well whenever you have a big if else if block replace it with a switch statement
 GodOfPro#7302: but i still need to program tho
 Yollie#2239: No, I literally heard about them a few months ago
 Redline#7370: just jump into unity instead, it's completely different to c# by itself
 JuliusCube#8501: agree but still
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: focusing on game design itself is about understanding how systems and mechanics work for an intended purpose, specifically focused on gameplay in this case. development is a technical skill, involved in developing how the working parts of the game work to support the game design
 Aiminer357#8033: if you have a huge project with huge team, i will hurt you if you give me bad code
 JuliusCube#8501: do you know how to use switch statements
 theChief#0001: Performance isn't _that_ important these days, and it's DEFINITELY not important for a 48h jam 😂
 Yollie#2239: Yeah I’ve only ever done game jams so uhh
do you guys think this video is enough to learn some c# before jumping to unity ?
i already know decent c++ so i know most of the basic programming stuff
 Aiminer357#8033: who cares about performance for a game jam
 Yollie#2239: Yeah it is
 JuliusCube#8501: getting by with only if statements sounds like a disaster for performance
 Yollie#2239: Oop wrong reply
 theChief#0001: I think having distinctions between disciplines is super useful tbh
 Yollie#2239: I’ve been able to get by in game dev with basically only if statements so I think it’s pretty possible if you can find a very visual engine
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i don't think that mark rosewater knows much about programming and he's like, an Esteemed game designer
 theChief#0001: Game development = making games
Game design = being creative with systems, mechanics, level design, etc in the context of making games
 JuliusCube#8501: "game dev" could also be for tabletop or card games as well
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: true, but the distinction is important in general
 theChief#0001: Other way around I think 😂
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: one informs the other but a game designer doesn't need to be a programmer at all because they could be a designer for tabletop games or card games
 JuliusCube#8501: when you are working solo theyre the same
 Aiminer357#8033: game design is a subsection of game dev
 Yollie#2239: This is definitely not because I’m bad at programming mhm
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: what? game development and game design are two completely different skills
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Just wanted to say that there was a joke involving the suggestion of the n-word earlier and that does absolutely not fly under our rules, and we've dealt with it accordingly. Jokes are not exempt from rules, please behave accordingly.
 Yollie#2239: Yes this exactly
 JuliusCube#8501: game design is the actual important thing you need for game dev imo, not programming
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: there's people with 20 years of experience and 11 person teams, like
 Aiminer357#8033: eh, problem solving skills in programming are important
 Yollie#2239: It’s not mandatory and people can get by without it
 Yollie#2239: Ok tbh I don’t think programming is like *that* needed for game devs
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: making something cool under time restraints and learning stuff
 theChief#0001: Most people who are entering shouldn't concern themselves with rank 😂 your score can be used as a measure of progress, but there are a ton of INCREDIBLY experienced devs taking part so your actual rank is going to be pretty meaningless!
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: and like. that's the point of all jams imo.
 JuliusCube#8501: just do a thing and when  youre stuck on how to do something google it
 GodOfPro#7302: c++
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i mean it's not a bad idea, you probably won't rank very high at all but it'll be a very good learning experience
 Aiminer357#8033: what programming language do you know?
 Yollie#2239: It’s only a solution to 50% since I will steal the other 50%
 JuliusCube#8501: not impossible to do, i know people who have done that before
 IcyPigs#1106: Got a spare slice?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: as for docs, the official unity docs should be good
 Redline#7370: number 2. don't use c# docs
 GodOfPro#7302: his c# tutorials aren't complete tho
 IcyPigs#1106: Brackeys 
 Yollie#2239: Pineapple pizza gang
 Redline#7370: number 1. Brackeys on youtube
 theChief#0001: Did you expect anything different?😉
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: all i can say is good luck! it'll be a formative experience!
 GodOfPro#7302: does anyone have a good c# docs or videos ?
 Yollie#2239: Yooo, based chief?
 DrNukeLear#2414: That’s like saying the moon is flat.
 IcyPigs#1106: Go
 GodOfPro#7302: then i guess 4 days time to learn unity
 Redline#7370: sir, you have 4 days
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: they'll still be around for a while, i think after the results?
 Yollie#2239: Money is the solution to 50% of problems
 GodOfPro#7302: imma try to learn unity in 1 week before the jam and see what i can do
 caibi#2508: wt hack is a pineaple pizza???!
 theChief#0001: That's a good opinion tho
 GodOfPro#7302: hello
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: will the channels be made invisible after the results or immediately as the jam ends?
 Redline#7370: oh god
 Yollie#2239: Pineapple pizza is good
 Yollie#2239: We will say bad opinions and there’s nothing you can do to stop us
 DrNukeLear#2414: Marmalade is less popular
 theChief#0001: It's a patreon only thread!
 caibi#2508: deleted deleted channel
 NotQuiteCool#8511: The numbers are skewed by Geoff, who is only 1 day old but an avid fan
 Yollie#2239: Deleted
 unityAccount#7810: I guess the non-jam channels are much more quiet
 caibi#2508: the rules says there was a #deleted channel, where is it?
 Lawn#1538: We say words like folks
 Lawn#1538: Us old folks can’t keep up with hip teens of today.
 theChief#0001: This is a small and skewed sample size 😂 teenagers tend to be a lot more vocal
 caibi#2508: Its make my brain hurt
 Redline#7370: but we also have 9th to 12th middle school
 Redline#7370: we have 1-8th primary -> 9th-13th middle school (or whatever you want to call that) -> god knows how much at the higher tiers
 MrBen#0001: we only have 8 grades. 4 grades in highchool. and 5 years on studies
 caibi#2508: oh hell, did you know that Chinise school has 30th grade total, it’s spend 30 years to finish it. jk
 Redline#7370: you see, this is a certified hungary moment
 MrBen#0001: wait wat lmao
 Redline#7370: I'm 15 in 10th grade after summer
 MrBen#0001: I'm 15 in 8th grade
 Redline#7370: + hungary moment
 Redline#7370: 8th grade
 Kendo#2848: how is 14 primary school lol
 MrBen#0001: lamo
 MrBen#0001: leak
 Redline#7370: hmm well that's funny
 MrBen#0001: ooo
 theChief#0001: (stickers included)
 DrNukeLear#2414: Sorry chief. Saw bandwagon, had to jump.
 MrBen#0001:
 theChief#0001: Keep emoji spam to  please.
 unityAccount#7810: Uhh
 MrBen#0001: 
 theChief#0001: Yep
 caibi#2508: so patroners can still chat after jam?
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: and many people do!
 DrNukeLear#2414: Well these channels close and you can stare at the lack of access until the next Jam
 caibi#2508: cool fact, a developer in dev-group never chat about development
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: no but all the channels they can see and access will be deleted
 DrNukeLear#2414: Good thanks, you?
 unityAccount#7810: After the jam, will all non-patreons be kicked?
 DrNukeLear#2414: Why, hello there!
 unrealterrashiv#9525:  hey lol, how you doing?
 Redline#7370: it's stupid and confusing
 Redline#7370: in primary school here you have the option to go to middle school 7th grade after grade 6, but otherwise you continue to grade 8 and go to middle school 9th grade after
 DrNukeLear#2414: Yeah. I think it was yesterday.
 Teslobo#8274: I see.
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: middle school has not been standard in the uk for a long time
 caibi#2508: nope, secondery school now
 Oxey405#2022: Someone else did ?
 DrNukeLear#2414: Someone else asked that question.
 caibi#2508: I remember that, when I was in primary, there’s a 13 years old boy in my class, he’s the tallest guy in our classroom.
 Teslobo#8274: Are you in primary education or not is what I need to ask
 Oxey405#2022: Any GDeveloppers here ? Or am I the only one...
 snuffysam#2767: …That’s still younger than Discord’s minimum age…
 Alchemical_Moon#8853: who want to team up?
 Oxey405#2022: hello
 unityAccount#7810: This is where the confusion comes from as in UK and USA they have primary school and middle school, which in many countries are just called primary school
 caibi#2508: very true
 Lawn#1538: Don’t worry. I’ve been speaking it all my life, and I’m still confused.
 Teslobo#8274: Apparently Chinese primary education is 6-12
 snuffysam#2767: “Some people are older than 11 in primary school because some kids get held back a year” isn’t the slam dunk you think it is…
 Redline#7370: it's primary school here from age 6 to like 14 I think
 MrBen#0001: yep
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: elementary school, going from age 6 to 11
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: 'elementary school' is more common worldwide
 caibi#2508: What is primary means in yours country
 MrBen#0001: men_with_bunny_ears_partying
 Lawn#1538: Well sorta.
 Lawn#1538: We just have Primary and High School in Oz.
 MrBen#0001: 👯‍♂️
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: here in italy it's one of the word used for elementary school. it's like, elementary school is primary school, middle school is lower secondary school, and highschool is upper secondary school
 caibi#2508: what?
 MrBen#0001: yep
 theChief#0001: I thought "primary school" was a UK thing tbh, wasn't aware other countries used it too 😂
 caibi#2508: In china it’s very normal, someone will get down-grade by bad behavior
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: it's still early, we're only 4 days away from the start of the jam, so don't be discouraged
 caibi#2508: and I’m in HK
 MrBen#0001: not in Poland
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: i'm pretty sure there's dozens of them
 Mr. Alias#1323: I have with little effect!
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: the world has multiple countries
 MrBen#0001: I'm just heading from primary school to highschool and I'm 15 😜
 Teslobo#8274: Have you tried 
 Mr. Alias#1323: Hello everyone! I'm looking for a team to offer up my Voice Acting! Please PM me!
 caibi#2508: no, why you think like that
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: either that is a lie and it's a weird question to ask in the first place, or they shouldn't be here in the first place
 Teslobo#8274: Primary school finishes at 11 otherwise
 Teslobo#8274: The teachers
 theChief#0001: Not in the UK 😂
 MrBen#0001: good eye
 Redline#7370: I love how every mod helper is here bc of that one question
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: if their profile is to be trusted i think they're in sixth grade?
 DrNukeLear#2414: So many purple names.
 Lawn#1538: Lol it is indeed an odd question, I was getting to that next. But point taken.
 BisectedBrioche#6824: You have to be over a certain age to be here, so no.
 theChief#0001: But anyone who answers "yes" is going to be removed from the server because it's against TOS
 Teslobo#8274: If you're asking because that's your age range then you probably aren't 13+
 Teslobo#8274: Not for the question itself
 Alchemical_Moon#8853: Is that not a weird ass question to ask
 caibi#2508: nothing… will I get banned by this question?
 Lawn#1538: That’s fine, just don’t go over board.
 Teslobo#8274: Any particular reason for this question?
 Lawn#1538: And hype.
 Alchemical_Moon#8853:  It was the sussy question from homie above that
 Alchemical_Moon#8853: I didn't bring it full size but it looks very cute
 MrBen#0001: (great show)
 MrBen#0001: nope, it's from Smiling Friends
 Alchemical_Moon#8853: Did you make the pfp? 
 MrBen#0001:
 MrBen#0001: Yes
ik
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: don't answer that with discord tos we have to ban anyone under 13
 Alchemical_Moon#8853: ❓❓❓❓❓❓❓
 caibi#2508: Is anyone here in primary school?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: since threads are opt-in only this could allow for spaces for engine-specific stuff while minimizing clutter
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: just about enough channels to be useful. if i may make a suggestion, what about threads for each engine in  so that there's places for engine specific stuff?
 Alchemical_Moon#8853: Good job lads, and good morning btw
 Alchemical_Moon#8853: Exactly
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: first time i'm here, but it seems pretty well organized. better than the other server i was in for the game jam, definitely seems less cluttered and more focused
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: ye
 Aiminer357#8033: did we have a chat timer last year too?
 Alchemical_Moon#8853: The server seems different from last year
 Lawn#1538: Move it to hype or I’ll bring out the snooze button
 Alchemical_Moon#8853: I
Did
It
For
Dramatic
Effect
Homie

 MrBen#0001: just
do
not send
messages
like
this
 Alchemical_Moon#8853: Sucks
 MrBen#0001: yep true
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i'm being blessed by weather that i can resist through without the AC being blasted, thankfully
 Alchemical_Moon#8853: This slow mode
 Lawn#1538: Spray bottle and a pedestal fan mate.
 Alchemical_Moon#8853: That was my first thought, some language close to german
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: it's too hot here my brain's not working good
 Alchemical_Moon#8853: Been a year
 Alchemical_Moon#8853: How's it going boys
 Alchemical_Moon#8853: 🤌
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: just realized that the theme reveal will happen right when i usually have dinner, which is great, because that means i can think about the theme over food
 Alchemical_Moon#8853: Wilkommen?
 Lawn#1538: Velkommen
 Zoro5168#0115: Hi here
 unrealterrashiv#9525: Im here
 MrBen#0001: o
 theChief#0001: \!ban \@ mark
 Snage#1337: Lol
 Zoro5168#0115: Yes
 theChief#0001: that's hype
 Snage#1337: Oooooo ok
 Zoro5168#0115: My most recent power unlock was that dark lookin dive so u can calculate my progress on that
 Snage#1337: Dung defender?
 Snage#1337: Dang nvm then that’s spoilers
 Mark Brown#6982: Just one minute this time
 Zoro5168#0115: No
 DrNukeLear#2414: I saw others with it and thought the same.
 Snage#1337: Have u gotten to godhome yet?
 Snage#1337: Love the timezone in the nickname def stealing that
 Zoro5168#0115: Ive reached royal waterways by now
 Zoro5168#0115: Im still playing hollow knight
 DrNukeLear#2414: I thought Mark got the day wrong for a minute.
 Snage#1337: Silksong is approaching
 Zoro5168#0115: Lets talk about games
 Snage#1337: Nice
 dardasaba#9759: Nice
 Zoro5168#0115: For me it started on 25th may
 dardasaba#9759: Making games :D
 Snage#1337: How ya gonna spend it?
 dardasaba#9759: School starts again in September the first
 dardasaba#9759: For me summer holiday **started** on June the 20th
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: twenty-onerst
 Zoro5168#0115: Extra sleep deprivation for me
 Yollie#2239: premieres at 3am
 Snage#1337: 21rst for me
 Snage#1337: 00F
 Zoro5168#0115: But my summer vacations ended on 1st july
 Zoro5168#0115: Im in high school
 caibi#2508: lmao
 Snage#1337: In July? Damn, oh w8 nvm I’m dumb college semesters are probably different from high school years.
 caibi#2508: the jam theme release on Friday, but… In my country, jam start on Saturday
 Zoro5168#0115: Me too
 caibi#2508: what ever, I need to go to school, haha.~
so sad, haiya
 Zoro5168#0115: Its morbin time
 JuliusCube#8501: time to have the same tab opem for 4 days straight
 caibi#2508: oh yes baby
 Zoro5168#0115: I got really excited for a second there
 Snage#1337: Scared me
 JuliusCube#8501: ah its a premiere
 JuliusCube#8501: what
👀
 Lawn#1538: So portal game *could* fit, but might be completely off depending on what Mark has chosen.
 caibi#2508: tricky rule
 Lawn#1538: You have sort of free range of what genre or style your game is, and tbh, you could submit anything but if your intention is to compete, it’s probably within your interest to fit your game to the theme.
 Lawn#1538: What rule has got you stumped in particular?
 caibi#2508: I don’t quite undertand the rules, hmmm… can I make a game simulate to other games, like portal or something?
 Jeker#3389: Spelunky 2 made me feel pain at first, and then like a god when i got the true final ending
 theChief#0001: I don't tend to play games for story or to "feel" anything, they are a bit of wind-down time for me! I like fast paced stuff that gets me into a bit of a flow, generally if it's got a high score table I'm content to try get as high a score as I can
 JuliusCube#8501: actually those emotions arent just existential dread. theres also curiosity, which may not count ad an emotion but if youve played outer wilds youll understand what im talking about
 BadPiggy#5202: Yes kek
Which is why I definitely like horror games for what they try to be 
 BadPiggy#5202: Like FURi is my favourite game ever, but that didn't really elicit anything lol
 JuliusCube#8501: yeah i get that,
they were fun, but you basically never felt sad, scared, or sometimes angry.
 BadPiggy#5202: There are games which I love more than these. But they didn't elicit emotion lol
 JuliusCube#8501: same with any type of music
 BadPiggy#5202: I've honestly played quite a lot.
But I don't mean I didn't enjoy any other games
 JuliusCube#8501: i guess i also havent played many games so that could also be why i have so little of them that actually illicit emotions
 BadPiggy#5202: I also played Dust only recently
Maybe a month or so ago
 JuliusCube#8501: could still be nostalgia
yeah
 BadPiggy#5202: Metal gear solid 2 and 3 are nostalgia for me kek
 BadPiggy#5202: No. I only recently played through the first metal gear solid as well. Definitely felt something at the end of that lol
 JuliusCube#8501: im assuming those 2 are only from nostalgia.
 DrNukeLear#2414: Psycho Mantis in the original MGS with the memory reading card trick is still something special.
 BadPiggy#5202: Well I mean, it's only because I can't think of another game which really made me feel anything tbh
Apart from :
- Dust an elysian tale
- The metal gear solid series
 JuliusCube#8501: thats why i love outer wilds so much. existential dread.
 JuliusCube#8501: well im also an emotionless freak but for me there are some games that actually ellicit emotion
and the funny thing is that emotion is existential dread.
 BadPiggy#5202: I'm playing through the first silent hill right now actually and oof
This is still atmospheric AF all these years later lol
 BadPiggy#5202: I actually really love horror games primarily cus they're the only games which really elicit any emotion lol
 JuliusCube#8501: but yea i guess
 JuliusCube#8501: my brain cant handle horror games theyre too creepy
 BadPiggy#5202: You know, that would make for a cool horror game
You start playing a two player fighting game or something in singleplayer, and then the more you play, the more the second character starts to actually do something and stuff happens idk
 JuliusCube#8501: im just not sure about the 2 player part
i mean id have to find a friend just so i could play it
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: with different formats for rhythm games
 BadPiggy#5202: Sad that two players games are kinda handicapped in jams
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: osu is basically a pvp rhythm based game
 Lawn#1538: Guitar Hero or Rock Band had that
 Yollie#2239: if you can do that itll be pretty funny
 Lawn#1538: It’s a pretty broad genre
 Lawn#1538: Not at all
 DrNukeLear#2414: Is it wrong that I’m thinking two player pvp rythym based game?
 Lawn#1538: Now I’m jazzed for more audio games this jam. This is excellent.
 Lawn#1538: You’d just run the tracks simultaneously and mute/unmute them so something like that could definitely work.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: what about only having polyrhythmic tracks and having two different tracks to switch between, each corresponding to each rhythm in the song?
 Teslobo#8274: It is very good
 BurnV06#5857: That was exactly what I was thinking lol. Sounds good might check it out
 Teslobo#8274: A rhythm game where you're moving forward on a track and making turns in time with the rhythm
 Lawn#1538: It’s dead easy. And there’s a randomise button if you’re not feeling creative.
 vicksonzero (Him | Web/Unity)#2295: oh i have seen this in js13k jam
 Lawn#1538: Or there’s Chiptone
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: or if you want to make them yourself, sfxr
 Yollie#2239: freesound.org
 Lawn#1538: Well yeah there’s that too
 Yollie#2239: yeah i might do that tbh.... or.... just get a musician?
 vicksonzero (Him | Web/Unity)#2295: i had bad time looking for sfx, usually banging my head against paid assets or assets with too much restrictions
 Lawn#1538: It’s been a while since I’ve used GarageBand. You should check out Reaper and/or LMMS. You’ll have a better time with those tools.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: oh thumper's FUN
 BurnV06#5857: What’s that?
 Yollie#2239: but it sounds horrible at high pitch
 Teslobo#8274: Sort of like thumper?
 Yollie#2239: The closest thing is the arcade synth which makes a strange chiptune sound
 BurnV06#5857: Idea: a rhythm racing hybrid game. I think it would work pretty well but I probably won’t make it myself
 Lawn#1538: 8-but sound is not that hard to reproduce. Bit crush a square wave. Job done.
 Teslobo#8274: No.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: :/ come on. do better
 Yollie#2239: Ah. I did a jam once that required me to get like 30 different sound effects for all the cards and now i just have a folder of sound assets
 Teslobo#8274: Seems like a sound idea
 Lawn#1538: But also, I feel like you can access some basic squares, sines, and triangle waves in GarageBand’s built in synths.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: pretty neat DAW for jams. might use it myself if i don't feel like using my main DAW, lmms
 Yollie#2239: Dont give badpiggy any ideas
 vicksonzero (Him | Web/Unity)#2295: yea now i got some pretty aolid directions in what to prepare before jam starts:
organize a list of quick assets that are universal enough to use 
 Yollie#2239: also you literally cant upload any soundfonts to garageband either 😭
 theChief#0001: I'd love to see a bunch of  audio beat-based games this time tbh
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i'm sure bosca ceoil has been talked abt for jam stuff that's fairly easy to use, yeah?
 Lawn#1538: Check out Chiptone
 theChief#0001: absolutely, yeah - I think the main thing is use the _audio system time_ rather than the game engine's internal timer 🙂
 Yollie#2239: the biggest problem with garageband is that it lacks the ability to make any 8-bit music which is dumb
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: surely this is like applicable to other engines too with some fenagling
 Yollie#2239: YOOOO garageband gang?
 L3mmy♡#2307: I tried making a rhythm game once, once I realised what I was undertaking I gave up quickly on the project...
 vicksonzero (Him | Web/Unity)#2295: interesting use of time
 theChief#0001: in unity, this is what I usually use ewe! 🙂
 DrNukeLear#2414: I compose while cooking using my iPad (GarageBand) and either go pixel art or hand draw and scan. If hand drawing I do it away from the machine while taking a break.
 Yollie#2239: i guess, you can compromise on the programming side a bit
 vicksonzero (Him | Web/Unity)#2295: i always go to Assets Jesus
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: rhythm games always fascinated me for How you would go about making them and syncing them to the music from a development standpoint
 Yollie#2239: just work fast
for music, I go for free stuff or find a teammate 🙂
 L3mmy♡#2307: Enough pings for now x3
 Yollie#2239: same here but i suck at rhythm games so uh
 vicksonzero (Him | Web/Unity)#2295: are there solo devs who also draw and make music?
how do you do all that  in such a short time period?
 theChief#0001: it was a different thing that I got some camellia music licensed, sorry 😛
 RedTeapot#1960: Nice. I wonder what price range it is
 DrNukeLear#2414: Oh wow
 theChief#0001: but generally you can contact him and licence a few for yourself, they aren't actually super expensive
 theChief#0001: camellia was kind enough to license a few tracks for free for the rhythm jam last year!
 RedTeapot#1960: Was that a copyright-free track or you have managed to license it?
 Luke#4525: Just put up my post on the team finder. I'm really excited to meet people
 theChief#0001: I'm tempted to do some rhythm stuff for this jam, because I love audio synced gameplay - so I've got all my reference links open 😂
 theChief#0001: when you've done as many jams as I have, there are very few genres you haven't covered 😉 though to be fair, I don't ever do puzzle games
 Lawn#1538: He's a Jam Machine
 theChief#0001: the final jam version has 3 levels (including one with a camellia track ❤️ ) and has a bunch of assets in there. It's "good enough" for now, I'd love to make it a full project but I'm midway through an xbox game at the minute 😂
 Lawn#1538: theChief needs to save some game making for the rest of us!
 ron0studios#4591: are you planning on making it a full game? with a couple more assets, levels and whatnot it would be amazing
 ron0studios#4591: wow that looks amazing
 theChief#0001: for rhythm you've got to be using the time the audio system is running at, otherwise you'll have a desync nightmare
 L3mmy♡#2307: am I the only one who's not able to DM the persons directly in the Team finder ?
 theChief#0001: yep, Time.fixedTime is still a float 😉
 DrNukeLear#2414: As much as I want to prove you wrong, I’m pretty sure that’ll be an excercise in futility.
 theChief#0001: anything other than AudioSettings.dspTime will desync with the audio over time!
 theChief#0001: still not good enough for rhythm 😛 you have to use AudioSettings.dspTime
 Lawn#1538: 140 is an absolute banger of a rhythm platformer
 DrNukeLear#2414: Unity’s FixedUpdate can be set to be pretty sharp.
 ron0studios#4591: I'm trying to bash together JSAB and a platformer into one, so basically an undertale sans fight with more sync to the rhythm and a bit less rpg
 Lawn#1538: you might have better or worse luck using FMOD or Wwise.
 theChief#0001: well, we can't give specific instructions on whether something is allowed or not - but so long as you're not writing code specifically for the jam you're ok 🙂
 ron0studios#4591: woah your game looks really fun from what I can see
 theChief#0001: yep 🙂
 SAGIII#2881: Hello guys! I wanted to ask if it is legit to use on the game jam a gesture recognition addon I made before?
I think the answer is no but I have hope.
 theChief#0001: would love to see your interpretation - basically I just did "if you do an action in time with the beat, you gain some speed", and made it a level-base speedrunning type game
 ron0studios#4591: um no i think its just an inbuilt engine function *(i have no clue though)*
 ron0studios#4591: oh lmao
 Lawn#1538: Are you using middleware  ?
 Teslobo#8274: Did you see the one yahtzee made like a year back?
 ron0studios#4591: lol
 theChief#0001: you basically can't use your engine's Time function, because it's too inaccurate 😅
 ron0studios#4591: my dream project is a rhythm based platformer and it has taken me a month to just get the backbone working
 Teslobo#8274: I've never made a rhythm game but I imagine there's a lot of technical polish needed to keep the rhythm correct
 ron0studios#4591: rhythm games are *h a r d*
 Zoro5168#0115: Hello
 DrNukeLear#2414: Hello!
 Zoro5168#0115: Hi im back
 Luke#4525: Hey everyone! I'm gonna try to find a team this will be my first jam if I can find a good fit
 KaineShadory#1612: been working on something for weeks but zero progress so gonna see if I can cram something in this jam hahah lezgo
 KaineShadory#1612: probably learn faster than I ever tried doing it alone
 KaineShadory#1612: yeah! that's the fun in a jam ain't it
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: it worked out alright - i woke up presented with a list of things he needed art for, then did them, submitted them, and he implemented them as i was getting ready for bed
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: For the most part we've aimed at broad-strokes value to add - stuff that many people (but not all) will find useful
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: Very true, it doesn't do a thing for early birds vs. night owls - if you've seen a neat solution to this elsewhere then please let me know!
 DrNukeLear#2414: Best of luck. Even if you’re working on a solo project it’s worth engaging with the community and leveraging advice and knowledge.
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: me and guitarkid live in the same country, and at least for the last jam we were out by genuinely five or six hours
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: especially with programmers i don't think local time is even a good metric for that
 L3mmy♡#2307: Heya!
 KaineShadory#1612: gonna try solo, due to circumstances I can't team up haha
 DrNukeLear#2414: Looking for a team or solo?
 KaineShadory#1612: imma jumping into this as a total beginner with zero experience lul
 DrNukeLear#2414: Sorry to hear that. Take it easy.
 Finboror#8230: wassupp
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Hope you get better soon!
 theChief#0001: oof, that sucks! Sorry to hear it 
 quyteriyaki#6095: pain, looks like I might miss this jam cause of covid
 quyteriyaki#6095: instead of asking for the location and then calculating the right time, just get all the clocks out and find out which one matches 🏃
 Lawn#1538: All of them at once?
 theChief#0001: oh additional clocks is a great idea
 quyteriyaki#6095: idk if it's too helpful of an idea but
on google calendar you can put events using different timezones, but it will still translate back to your own timezone when you have a look at it on the calendar.
you could have an event just to say someone's online from x to y and you can sort of know if they're available or not.
obviously doesn't show the exact current time they are in, in which you could probably set an additional clock on your mobile phone  for that timezone
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: That's why the timezone entry for London on the Team Finer is currently UTC+0 - technically very wrong, but we didn't have a reliable way to handle _all_ countries timezone changes and test in a short amount of time, so I went with what Wikipedia said as the default 🙈
 Lawn#1538: But only certain states.
 Lawn#1538: Daylight savings is a thing here too.
 theChief#0001: this doesn't even have the australia :30 timezones 
 quyteriyaki#6095: ~~now for Daylight savings~~
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: But yeah, picking a specific timezone across a map is a nightmare
 DrNukeLear#2414: It’d throw you off more if it was in Chinese.
 Domodiak#1234: lol
 SlamBamActionman#7160: I get that text in Swedish and it throws me off so much lol
 Domodiak#1234: i hope im right cause im in different timezone
 Domodiak#1234: or 
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Shame, it was a neat idea
 SlamBamActionman#7160: *except timezones are not straight vertical lines aaaargh*
 SlamBamActionman#7160: We had some really cool timezone selection at one point that Dotwo made. Was like a world map and divided into timezones so you selected the ones that overlapped the countries you wanted to search
 SquidGeneral10#4090: plus maybe alarm clocks if the available times are that rigid lol
 theChief#0001: ah I see
 SquidGeneral10#4090: that bot is what I'd recommend, then
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: I meant about tracking availability - who is online what time? Using a spreadsheet lets me see "this person is online then"
 theChief#0001: jam starts at 
 SquidGeneral10#4090: There's a World Time discord bot that everyone can add their times to, and a /list command that shows what time it was for everyone when used - here's a link:
 Omegnight#7081: By experience they are a pain, especially with summer times not being the same for every countries
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: Does anyone actually have a good recommendation for handling timezones? I've never found a good one, I've just used a shared spreadsheet which people coloured in/commented on in the past
 no_ones#4897: planning timezones with the team in advance
 no_ones#4897: okay thanks
 SquidGeneral10#4090: Yeah, it's automatically adjusted to show whatever your timezone is IIRC
 Mark Brown#6982: yep
 no_ones#4897: is the Jam submission open and close time on itch.....thats "July 15th 2022 at 10:30 PM to July 18th 2022 at 12:30 AM" in my local time?
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: We still have to decide whether we're going to tell other people "clone the source, here's how to build and host", or whether it's a hosted resource they spin up a new thing of - plenty of time to arrange that (in the winter!)
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: it'll get there eventually
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: (It needs some tidying up before I'd recommend other groups use it, I've yeeted in a lot of copypasta since the site when live to hotfix stuff lol)
 null_ham#2050: epic
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: It's on the GMTK github org 🙂
 null_ham#2050: would the source be on github for other communities?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: It has been (sorta) programmed with it in mind
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: We are! Exact plans are still under development, but we want to open out the tool to other community/jams 😄
 Mark Brown#6982: You'll have to ask  😉
 Mark Brown#6982: Team Finder is a community-made initiative, I believe they are looking to expand it beyond GMTK
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: you'd have to poke the people that made it lol
 SquidGeneral10#4090: 👀 can we poke Mark until he makes this happen?
 Omegnight#7081: There are still tons of jams though
 theChief#0001: The team finder is an excellent tool, if you made it a paid thing and licensed it to people I'd definitely use it for juice jam and bullet hell jam
 Selviam#7268: 11 people? gosh thats a ton
 SquidGeneral10#4090: I've worked with him before, but I think this is the biggest team he's handled
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: shadow's a competent lead you'll have fun i'm sure
 Tex B.#4484: 11 people is a studio, you have a whole studio
 SquidGeneral10#4090: Yep-yep. Level designing!
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: That's not an official thing, that's just an observation from previous years
 Lawn#1538: Are you in the Shadow clan?
 Tex B.#4484: That's very fair
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: As there are so many people uploading games at the same time I would also advise you just get your game up when you can and when the timer runs out then go back and do all the pretty stuff. It sucks to be struggling to upload your project because a bunch of people who are already finished are picking colour choices.
 no_ones#4897: me too 🥲
 no_ones#4897: i wont do that for this jam tough....just for info purpose
"If you need more control over the customization of your pages on itch.io you can request access to the CSS editor. CSS customization must be enabled on a per-account basis."
 SquidGeneral10#4090: 'Ello gamers!
 dardasaba#9759: Well, I've got stuff to do, I'm gonna stop procrastinating them by chatting here :D
Cya all later!
 no_ones#4897: so i know css....i learned it during my web dev cousre....so if i just request itch it would allow me to modify my css?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Also as people were talking about things to learn or practice before the jam starts: there is a pinned post with a suggested time breakdown for the jam on it so have a look at that if anyone needs some guidance about time management and what they should do before the time starts
 Tex B.#4484: Now I've gotta learn css
 dardasaba#9759: Oh that's interesting, I didn't know you can edit the CSS of the itch page (although it makes sense, I've seen itch pages that couldn't have been made with the default edit theme settings)
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Yeah- Again there is an FAQ and in itch page with all this information in it for exactly this reason so please do read those first before asking rules questions
 Tex B.#4484: Oh for real you can do that
 Mark Brown#6982: You have to request it from Itch
 Mark Brown#6982: Some accounts are granted access to edit their page's CSS
 PepperBoi#4544: There is a way to edit it with css
 Tex B.#4484: Ayyy I thought so I just couldn't remember
 dardasaba#9759: At this pace, Mark will quote the entire FAQ twice within the next hour xD
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: nope that's it
 Selviam#7268: wait thats it? I honestly thought it'd be more confusing to look at
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Yes, you can decorate the page and change the game infomration to flesh it out etc but you can't change the game files
 no_ones#4897: decorating is not an issue....like every option is straight forward....struggle is making it look pretty.....coz i tried it once....and it turned horrible
 Mark Brown#6982: "You can change your game's page during this time though, including the thumbnail, description text, screenshots, and page design. You'll want to do this as fast as possible though, as the majority of the ratings happen at the very start of the rating period."
 PepperBoi#4544: You have been able to in the past one
 Omegnight#7081: Everyone should try out the technicalities of the engine they will be using this week,  exporting a project, making a build, things like that
 Tex B.#4484: Actually that brings up a question, can you change the game page after the jam time has ended (not the game file, the itch page)
 Selviam#7268: well idek how you'd start decorating it in the first place ive always used the default white backgrounds so ill probably just watch a couple tutorials before the jam
 no_ones#4897: ohh yeah that seems a great idea.....currently woking on a mobile game...i can test that project building it as HTML
 Tex B.#4484: Pshh
 Mark Brown#6982: Always look at the colour of the usernames - only Red and Pink are official moderation accounts 😄
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I wouldn't worry about playing your itch page look good until after the jam because you can't decorate it to fit your game before you know what the game is
 Tex B.#4484: What That's just my name
 no_ones#4897: wait a min......whats going on with your names........bark mrown and mark brown.....i just tought you were same person changing profile pics for some reason
 Omegnight#7081: Try making a nearly empty project this week to see if it works well on all browsers?
 Selviam#7268: list of things i gotta learn the basics of how to do before the jam
- learn how to add and make game music
- make a good looking itch.io game site
- building webGL and putting it onto itch.io
im glad its not as long of a list as my last jam i didnt even know how to use UI then!
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: get people to playtest it
 no_ones#4897: ohh okay.....got it.....am using linux so i cannot test on windows....hopefully a game running on firefox should not cause issues on chrome
 Mark Brown#6982: "You must produce a digital computer game, that runs on Windows - or web browsers supported by Windows. You can support additional platforms (such as Mac or mobile) if you like, but a Windows / browser build is necessary. "
 Selviam#7268: looking at this reminded me of when i made games in rpg maker i loved the program but i was too young to really understand it
 no_ones#4897: standalone? so.....browser games....Like Html format? isnt allowed?
 Tex B.#4484: Gdevelop is similar to construct, and would fit the guidlines
 no_ones#4897: yep thanks
 no_ones#4897: yeah i was gonna use Gdevelop....
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: there's an FAQ page and a jam page was all this information in it you can reference at any time
 Mark Brown#6982: "You can make your game in whatever engine, programming language, or software you like. We recommend engines such as Unity, Unreal Engine, Game Maker, Godot, Construct, and PICO-8. "
"You may use engines designed for specific genres such as RPG Maker or Adventure Game Studio, but we don't recommend it as the GMTK Jam is intended towards making games with brand new concepts and gameplay mechanics."
 Merus#7019: must be playable on Windows, must be standalone
 DrNukeLear#2414: Correct, must be playable on windows
 no_ones#4897: hey just a quick question......there no rules with which engine to use right?
 Eyesbesore#7355: same
 DrNukeLear#2414: Yeah - I’m not looking forwards to that either mate.
 Lawn#1538: Thankful to have an AC this year, but we haven't needed it because of all the rain.
 Eyesbesore#7355: we don't do that here lul
 Eyesbesore#7355: ceiiling fan whats one of those
 Lawn#1538: With a pedestal or ceiling fan blasting.
 Lawn#1538: Sleeping is pretty difficult if you don't have air conditioning.
 Lawn#1538: But yeah, it's not pleasant.
 Lawn#1538: Fortunately, lots of workplaces that are typically outdoors will shut down on those extreme heat days.
 Merus#7019: it was _pretty bad_
 Lawn#1538: That was a time.
 Merus#7019: Lawn, you're in AU, right? were you around for the 50 degree days we had a couple of years back?
 Mark Brown#6982: I can't even imagine 40
 Mark Brown#6982: Could be 34 on Sunday in the UK 🥵
 Lawn#1538: That's spicy. You get used it though.
 Merus#7019: whoo, that's pretty hot
 Omegnight#7081: 37°C where I live, some cities will have 40
 Lawn#1538: What's the predicted temp?
 Merus#7019: don't you dare link a video "about the jam"
 hierr777#8659: i takes
 hierr777#8659: who takes a video about jam?
 dardasaba#9759: 👍 thanks
 hierr777#8659: btw
 Lawn#1538: I've got a link hollup
 dardasaba#9759: Btw, who drew the link emotes? They're really cute :)
 Mark Brown#6982: Well if i'm looking for unfunny memes from like 10 years ago, you'll be my first port of call!
 hierr777#8659: small easter egg
 hierr777#8659: for save history
 hierr777#8659: i want it because was many rickrolls in chat
 hierr777#8659: ok
 Mark Brown#6982: There's only one theme on the GMTK Game Jam, and I don't take outside requests, sorry!
 PepperBoi#4544: Why
 dardasaba#9759: Did you really just ping him for this
 RedTeapot#1960: Oh no
 hierr777#8659:  can be extra theme "Rick Astley"
PLEASE IF U CAN DO IT
 unityAccount#7810: Luckily, not too much modding has been needed so far afaik
 RedTeapot#1960: Why ask then?
 hierr777#8659: i know
 Mark Brown#6982: There will always be someone online to moderate, but no one can be online 24 hours a day!
 hierr777#8659: i know
 RedTeapot#1960: They're offline probably
 hierr777#8659: i dont see another 2 mods
 null_ham#2050: what
 hierr777#8659: WAS 3 MODS
 hierr777#8659: WHY ONLY ONE MOD
 Scolon#4218: Yeah starts midday for me
 Jaixden#7480: That's a pain il only have 4pm BST till like 10pm bst to work on the game both days because I work 9 till 4
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: For me its starting at 2pm
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: 4 days
 Jaixden#7480: When is the game jam
 Teslobo#8274: They do, just mixed in with a lot of other content now
 Lawn#1538: Not sure, but if you've never watched that or heard of fail faster, check it out.
 gruebite#5770: some large tech companies also operate on that mantra
 LorantC#5076: You can’t know what’s good if you first don’t know what’s bad.
 Snage#1337: Do they still do game development vids?
 Lawn#1538: Iterate, iterate, iterate.
 Lawn#1538: The faster you fail, the quicker you learn about what's wrong.
 voithos#0258: (I.e. mastery takes time)
 voithos#0258: Fail fast, succeed slowly? 🙂
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: True
 Aiminer357#8033: putting it on my to watch list
 Lawn#1538: There's even an extra credits on the idea, go figure:
 gruebite#5770: i do enjoy that mantra as well: fail fast
 Aiminer357#8033: hmm. i dont really do art first cuz i might not have thought of a theme yet
 gruebite#5770: good failures you learn from?
 Lawn#1538: Only if you don't learn from the experience.
 Aiminer357#8033: lol i would say yes
 gruebite#5770: you can give up instantly, which is the fastest way to fail
 gruebite#5770: is giving up a failure? :P
 dardasaba#9759: Starting at 20:00 for me, I'll work for a couple of hours to hopefully have a simple prototype or maybe art (because at night I'll probably wanna do art more than coding), and then go to sleep
 Aiminer357#8033: ooh nver heard of that before
 Lawn#1538: Fail faster is one of my favourite mottos.
 Lawn#1538: Precisely
 LorantC#5076: “Fail faster”
 LorantC#5076: Agree, it’s building good habbits
 Lawn#1538: Failure is inevitability of anything you're new to, embrace it.
 Aiminer357#8033: dont say "i'll do it when i want to". say "i'll spend 1 hour daily working on it"
 Lawn#1538: That was similar to my first jam, I actually came up with my mechanic pretty quickly then went sleep knowing I would wake up and get straight into it.
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: Being afraid to fail.
 Aiminer357#8033: discipline
 gruebite#5770:  discipline > motivation
 Snage#1337: How do y’all keep motivated on a project that long though
 Lawn#1538: But you do you.
 Aiminer357#8033: the theme is released at 2 am for me so im gonna take 30 minutes of brainstorming before sleeping and  starting coding
 Lawn#1538: I can only speak for myself, however, I'm pretty certain it's universally agreed upon by the mods and fellow helpers that jammers should sleep.
 gruebite#5770: i'll be doing this jam from a beach in the carribean
 Aiminer357#8033: you do you mate
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: Haha, I'm not gonna sleep during this jam.
 Lawn#1538: Sounds like you'll take all the sleep you can get, when you can get it.
 LorantC#5076: A good prototype can be made in a week. It’s all the things that come after take 5-6 months. The last 10% takes more than the first 90%
 dardasaba#9759: (although that's because all of my games so far are pretty small, but my second game is a decently big one and I've made it in a week for a self imposed jam)
 Snage#1337: “Is it possible to learn this power?”
 Aiminer357#8033: goddamn.  cant relate
 voithos#0258: Yeah! I've been trying to do 2-3 a year or so, and it's been really rewarding having a collection of little creations (albeit imperfect) and seeing progress over time
 gruebite#5770: 35 here :P
 dardasaba#9759: > how many of your projects are done in 1 week?
Actually, except my first game when I was still learning, all of mine xD
 LorantC#5076: All this staying awake talk.. I’m like “is this a young man joke I’m to 30s to understand” haha. I couldn’t even if I wanted to. Plus with a 2 year old running around
 Snage#1337: That I should try, would probably help keep me on track
 gruebite#5770: yeah, depends on how i'm feeling.  but the 7 day long jams, sometimes i'm in a flow for hours into the night where sleeping would be difficult
 Snage#1337: More like how many of my projects are done lol. Thank you tho
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: One time I stayed up for 2 days
 Powercore2000#0189: it entirely depends on what you wanna get out of it. Finishing a game. Trying new innovations. Testing your skills. ect
 Lawn#1538: I thought an all nighter would help with my first jam, but it did not at all. Some people thrive, I do not. My coding gets even worse, and I miss simple things. Try to sleep and eat well.
 voithos#0258: If you do them with some regularity, it's also a fun measure of your progress!
 Aiminer357#8033: youre making a game in 48 hours. be honest. how many of your projects are done in 1 week?
 Toucan#3289: It's a short time for prototyping that can be whatever you want it to be!
 Snage#1337: Honestly didn’t cross my mind but very valid
 gruebite#5770: por que no los dos?
 Aiminer357#8033: fun!
 Snage#1337: What are jams for?, learning or testing your skills?
 Snage#1337: Yo this is gonna be my second attempt to actually get something done this jam and It made me think
 Powercore2000#0189: It is a choice, but not a healthy one. Unless you've trained on doing that for a long time, and even then it can be rough
 LorantC#5076: Great point. It is all about learning/exploring after all
 dardasaba#9759: Lol, that doesn't sound very healthy xD
 Aiminer357#8033: oof. i dont recommend that
 dardasaba#9759: Good morning!
 Lawn#1538: Perfectionism has its grip on people in so many different ways. One tip to overcome perfectionism that works for me, is to let go of the idea that my creations are a permanent representation of my skills. The whole game jam thing is a learning process, and you'll get better if you let yourself create with reckless abandon. Probably sounds silly, but it honestly works.
 gruebite#5770: i like to go 48 hours no sleep mode
 Toucan#3289: And of course, remember to take breaks 🙂
 LorantC#5076: Yeah! Thanks for all the support. Feeling better 😄
 Toucan#3289: Don't be afraid to use the first idea you come up with either. I find a lot of jammers (me included) try making a unique mechanics, or trying to force themselves to be really creative, which can be stressful. If you're not trying to win, sometimes simple/obvious is best.
 LorantC#5076: My biggest concern is to learn how to stop myself from complicating things. Bad habbits of perfectionism and being nitpicky. I have n projects on the pipeline for years cause “it would be cool if”
 Aiminer357#8033: no harm in looking here for ideas
 Powercore2000#0189: The best way to even it out I've found is doing small things to reaffirm that you can do it. make a small asset/bit of code for fun, play a game that inspires you, stuff like that.
 Lawn#1538: You've got this.
 Aiminer357#8033: sometimes you go hours into developing and realise "maybe my idea sucks"
 LorantC#5076: Oh okay haha.
 Lawn#1538: You are not alone with that feeling.
 Aiminer357#8033: oh yeah definitely
 Powercore2000#0189: 100% normal lol
 LorantC#5076: Good morning game engine users. First time joining a jam. While I have experience I have this sinking feeling that I won’t be able to do anything and all creativity is out of reach. Is this normal? 😅
 tykenn#8548: good point
 Merus#7019: well when the term 'engine' was created, it was running a lot of that stuff _instead_ of the OS
 tykenn#8548: But if we're talking about what makes the game run, how is the game engine doing that any more than the hardware, the OS, the game-specific code, etc? I usually think of game engines more in context with development. Like a game is "made with Unity" not "run by Unity"
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Just think of this, a car needs a engine to run, well a game needs the same thing... Foundations stay put... That's all they do
 tykenn#8548: Well, unless you count software engineer...
 tykenn#8548: Yeah, foundation was more what I was thinking. But since I'm not an engineer I should probably stop trying to make analogies to cars and buildings
 ♧♣#4925: What would a more accurate term be? Foundation?
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Swapping engines mid project is a lot of work, like a car engine
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Yes, its not impossible, but its really hard, there are some cases where you need to tear everything out that the old engine has just to get the new engine in.  But that probably why calling it a Game Engine makes sense, since the engines could have different features from each other (even if they can do the same thing) located in different spaces, and others could not have a feature that one has, and you have to rebuild the code base to to work with that engine...
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: Man, I hope I can drive the unreal car.
 tykenn#8548: Yeah, I don't mean to call that easy, but it's... possible, right? I'm not a car expert, but doesn't it happen sometimes with great effort?
 birdstone#3073: man thats unreal
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Try swapping a car engine some time...
 tykenn#8548: Sometimes I wonder if calling them game "engines" was a mistake. It sort of makes it sound like a component that you could actually swap out.
 Hobusu#5033: Why Not Just™️ release on all platforms
 Scolon#4218: I hear this one way too often
 Merus#7019: "just add multiplayer"
 wren#0640: "unity = bad, cheap. unreal = good, expensive."
 Techno#1832: sup
 Merus#7019: given how informed all gamers are about game engines, I assume all gamers are also game devs
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: why not both simultaneously? degamer
 Hobusu#5033: Can't allow gamers on this, the Game Maker's Toolkit server
 Sodaguyz#4729: :0
 Merus#7019: also no gamers, we can't have gamers on this discord
 panda studios#0773: ha
 wren#0640: no game devs allowed in this jam sorry
 Sodaguyz#4729: and game devs
 Sodaguyz#4729: only gamers are allowed in the gamejam
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Hello my fellow gamers and game devs!!
 Sodaguyz#4729: sup gamer B)))
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Sup, gamers and game devs
 panda studios#0773: Hello People
 Ursprache(eggroll gang)#8310: Greetings...
 ApolloPlease#1777: Barked
 wren#0640: mark'd
 Lawn#1538: And the top 100 are marked by Mark.
 SlothHugger-v2.0#3202: yes sorry, i read about that, it skipped my mind...
 SlothHugger-v2.0#3202: ohhhh
 Lawn#1538: We the people vote 🗳
 wren#0640: they only go through the top 100 for the videos
 SlothHugger-v2.0#3202: damnnn how much time did it take them to go thru the videos.... 5k is ALOT
 SlothHugger-v2.0#3202: oh perff
 wren#0640: out of roughly 20k joined iirc
 wren#0640: well last jam only 5k people submitted
 Lawn#1538: At least a dozen.
 Coffe#5594: 15.5k people. Probably thousands
 Lawn#1538: I only know 3D too. The jam theme will not be specific to a certain dimension.
 PepperBoi#4544: I’d bet thousands of teams
 SlothHugger-v2.0#3202: lol i bet, there are hundreds of teams already
 AkariZero#2463: yeah otherwise Mark and his team would never get more videos done
 PepperBoi#4544: Yep
 SlothHugger-v2.0#3202: the jam happens once a year?
 PepperBoi#4544: The themes are normally more vague than that
 AkariZero#2463: I wonder if Mark will finally make "Shooting as movement" theme game jam he's been joking about :p
 SlothHugger-v2.0#3202: ohhh i see
 SlothHugger-v2.0#3202: oh okay, the thing is I only know 3d game designing rn, if the topic is somehting to make in 2D i will be screwed lol 😂
 Hobusu#5033: You can make pretty much any type of game you want, so long as it fits the theme and meets the submission requirements listed on the Jam page (so it has to be able to run on Windows for a start)
 Lawn#1538: The jam theme will be announced on the day!
 SlothHugger-v2.0#3202: and see where i stand
 PepperBoi#4544: Game jams are a huge learning experience so even if you don’t finish you’ll learn something
 SlothHugger-v2.0#3202: yea im just gonna give those 48 hours my best
 Lawn#1538: I did my first jam solo, and it was a very rewarding experience.
 SlothHugger-v2.0#3202: so what are the topics like in the game jam? is it like, it can be anything?
 Lawn#1538: Then I honestly think you’re in a pretty good position to do it solo.
 SlothHugger-v2.0#3202: well tbh, everything, I love it. Since I started learning UE, daily i have done it for like 7-8 hours, going in the depths and trying to learn more, despite having a 8 hr job on the side. Its just a passion for it ive seen but its not even been a month since I started learning... so thats why I am dicey haha.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: sleep is good and healthy
 PepperBoi#4544: **No sleep til Game Jam**
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: **Brooklyn!**
 AkariZero#2463: *has an Australian friend to help cover when he needs to sleep*
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: **No sleep til**
 Lawn#1538: What have you enjoyed most about the game making process?
 AkariZero#2463: also gets you more sleep...
 Lawn#1538: Leveraging a team can take a little pressure off you for areas you’re not so confident in.
 SlothHugger-v2.0#3202: thats the plannnn 🙂
 Lawn#1538: If you’re confident you’ve picked up enough from experimenting with Unreal to make something, then put those new skills to the test.
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: 🤣
 Lawn#1538: Like Blaziken said, there are pros and cons to either.
 Lawn#1538: Because that seems to be a common divider.
 SlothHugger-v2.0#3202: it will be kind off, the other ways I have learnt UE is thru guided projects. So technically this jam will be my first ever game. yes
 Lawn#1538: Is it your first ever game too?
 SlothHugger-v2.0#3202: Its my first ever game jam and I am idk feeling the pressure of first ever jam lol
 AkariZero#2463: I find for my first game jam a team works best for me. I don't have enough experience to make a game within 2 days on my own
 Lawn#1538: I think most people find each other via the team finder and discord then break off and do their own thing.
 Lawn#1538: What’s keeping you on the fence?
 ZenTeapot#6812: Do most people just collaborate through discord on this jam?
 Hobusu#5033: I'm sure there's still a fair number of people going solo, there are pros and cons to it
 SlothHugger-v2.0#3202: does everyone have a team for this game jam? I was planning to go solo but now I think that will be not a nice call. lol
 tykenn#8548: I guess I also played The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe recently, and that was more normal and less depressing.
 AkariZero#2463: Final fantasy but Oregon Trails with rogue-like pathing
 AkariZero#2463: I have an idea for a game
 Hobusu#5033: Even after you reach the credits the story isn't even entirely over at that point, btw
 Hobusu#5033: (And also you can always start a new save file on Hell Mode)
 Lawn#1538: I had played Hollow Knight to completion, sans the final boss then just stopped.
 Lawn#1538: I have a tendency to save games that are near completion so they will last for longer. Weird I know.
 Hobusu#5033: Easily in my top 3 favorite single-player games
 Lawn#1538: I’ve played a fair bit of Hades while I was care taking a while back, but I’ll admit I haven’t finished it. I’ve beat the main run a few times, but I know I you need to finish it 10 times to see the rest of the story.
 Hobusu#5033: Hades is fantastic
 theChief#0001: I just keep going, I love watching the story unfold. I think I'm on about 300 hours now 😂
 AkariZero#2463: I beat hades twice
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I think I just beat the main story.
 wren#0640: i need to beat hades
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I was just playing Hades like 10 mins ago. Lol.
 theChief#0001: If you haven't yet played Hades, play Hades. It's more AA than indie, but I do love a good AA game
 tykenn#8548: Cool, yeah that one is great. (And one of the more mild games on my list, which is saying something)
 Lawn#1538: Omori is actually on my wishlist!
 tykenn#8548: Also Rakuen for big wholesome sad.
 Lawn#1538: I seldom watch streamers, but I did watch someone play this recently and I’m down to check it out myself. Bugs and food, what a combo. 🐛 🍎
 tykenn#8548: Omori for whimsical depression. Hello Charlotte for convoluted whimsical depression
 AkariZero#2463: it's soooo good. You'll love it.
 Lawn#1538: I don’t care what it is, I’m open to playing everything and hearing what every one else is into.
 JohnLivingston#4642: Still gotta play this!! I’ve heard amazing things
 JohnLivingston#4642: Don’t know if it’d be considered Indie but I just finished Bugsnax and it’s incredible
 tykenn#8548: Most of the indie games I've been playing lately are weird horror RPGs that I'm not sure is in most people's tastes
 Lawn#1538: Played it (Inscryption), it was great, haven’t finished yet. Loved the excessive use of that sub synth.
 PepperBoi#4544: 20 minutes till dawn
 Lawn#1538: Although, I get the feeling most of you are asleep now.
 AkariZero#2463: Inscryption
 Lawn#1538: Indie game recommendations, go!
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: lol sorry you're having a rough night
 𝔘𝔱𝔱𝔢𝔯𝔏𝔦𝔪𝔦𝔱#2948: Good night
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: 👄
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Games!
 JohnLivingston#4642: Well I can’t wait to see what everyone makes! Good luck all 😄
 JohnLivingston#4642: Great advice Chief!
 AkariZero#2463: I just want something done 😄
 RiverDog#8199: this is my first solo jam, planning to keep it simple as possible
 ConstantDerivative#6302: good morning (or afternoon or evening depending on time zone)
 RiverDog#8199: haha sage advice
 theChief#0001: Have fun, don't compare your game to other games in the jam, make something you think you can do in 20-30% of your available time, and SLEEP
 ZEST#7932: Gotcha!
 RiverDog#8199: Chief what is the secrete
 theChief#0001: The channel for posting pics and things will open when the jam starts!
 ZEST#7932: Nada
 AkariZero#2463: Thanks. The fact I have a job now helps.  Also  Try Art help? channel
 ZEST#7932: Just needed an opinion in which art style is more suited for a 2d platformer 🥲
 AkariZero#2463: But this will be my first game jam. Have 3 other people with me and one of them has made a game before so we have a pretty good shot of making something hopefully
 JohnLivingston#4642: Damn sorry to hear that Akari! I hope this one is a better experience for you!
 ZEST#7932: Nvm there is no such place
 ZEST#7932: Where can I post pics?
 AkariZero#2463: tried once but our group's scope was way too big and was going through some depression due to lack of work
 JohnLivingston#4642: Have you all done many jams before?
 JohnLivingston#4642: Haha I pretty much say the same thing before every game jam
 RiverDog#8199: Haha yea, I guess for starters that'll work.
 AkariZero#2463: still debating on that
 AkariZero#2463: though feel like I could do with an extra artist and sound person XD
 AkariZero#2463: me too!
 JohnLivingston#4642: Hey everyone! So excited for this weekend 😊
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: 
 theChief#0001: Yeah it stems from music jam ☺️
 kizi#8345: Hows the jam going
 wren#0640: does it come from like jam sesh
 wren#0640: where did the term game jam actually originate?
 DrNukeLear#2414: Sorry, I’m team marmite
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Hello Jammers!
 Zoro5168#0115: g'mornin
 DrNukeLear#2414: That’s an adventure all in itself
 theChief#0001: More fun to look forward to 😂
 DrNukeLear#2414: Teething yet?
 Lawn#1538: My sleep cycle has been messed up for years. Events and gig work really don’t lend well to healthy sleep patterns.
 NoelJasik#8768: Well i am gonna try to fall asleep, wish me luck
 Lawn#1538: Sleep comes in patterns, geez must be nice.
 NoelJasik#8768: That's good to hear
 DrNukeLear#2414: My sleep pattern was messed up before I had kids lol
 NoelJasik#8768: I meant to reply to the other guy
 NoelJasik#8768: Well here's where we are diffrent, i just have a messed up sleeping pattern
 NoelJasik#8768: I have been trying for like an hour
 NoelJasik#8768: I can't
 DrNukeLear#2414: I remember those days! I have a twelve year old and a soon to be four year old!
 cathy#3897: sleep
 NoelJasik#8768: Personally i would love to see diffrent interpration of the exact same idea
 theChief#0001: Fellow Brit here 😂 I have a 4 month old son so sleep happens in chunks of 2-3 hours 👍
 NoelJasik#8768: It's almost 3 am
 NoelJasik#8768: I am from poland
 DrNukeLear#2414: They’d be twice as useless in the UK 😉 Oh hang on GMT! Fellow Brit?
 tykenn#8548: If everyone was making the same game (e.g. "make a lunar lander game"), then I imagine it with a specific list of requirements that must be present to count, like "The spaceship must be able to move both vertically and horizontally based on player input". But the submissions would prioritize cutting corners over quality, so the games probably wouldn't be very fun.
 NoelJasik#8768: What if i added 2 expired pizza hat coupons for 5 bucks
 DrNukeLear#2414: Lol
 batsiouny#2374: i'm sorry this is the most i can do
 batsiouny#2374: brave tarnished, thou shouldst join me
 DrNukeLear#2414: I could be convinced
 batsiouny#2374: are there any designers looking for a team ?
 Lawn#1538: Although the aim is to generally code
 NoelJasik#8768: I can't fall asleep
 Lawn#1538: That’s basically the premise of the website ~~kata~~ code wars
 snuffysam#2767: `System.out.println("A strange game. The only winning move is not to play.");`
 wren#0640: the problem with that is youd have to decide when something "counts" as a functional game if youre basing the winner on lowest character count with a functional game
 Selviam#7268: that sounds really cool
 tykenn#8548: Has there ever been a code golf game jam? Like everyone tries to make the same game, but they have to do it in as few code characters as possible?
 Selviam#7268: oh wait do you mean doing more than doing one that ends with a semicolon?
 birdstone#3073: oh my god trying to read and edit 1 line of code for a game would be a nightmare
 Selviam#7268: that'd be so cool id get to spend most of my time on art if i can figure out what the one line is gonna be
 birdstone#3073: i'll need an optometrist after making a game like that
 DrNukeLear#2414: What you need is some pixel art 😉
 tykenn#8548: Easy. Just remove the line breaks and make the semicolons do their job
 BurnV06#5857: "import minecraft.exe" done
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Test project for what, are you making a game? That's super cool
 birdstone#3073: how about make a game with 1 line of code
 RiverDog#8199: speaking of text boxes, who knows of a good Unity Asset for text boxes.  Im looking for simple NES style like in metal marines or like any other game of that time
 lilburlap#8480: Wait it would be possible to make one of those solo journaling games if you just had like a text box to type in along with the random elements in the game
 Selviam#7268: or maybe one of those paper video games
 lilburlap#8480: Nice
 BurnV06#5857: "Here's a jpeg for a board, use your fingers as the pieces."
 Selviam#7268: i meant coding script but script dialogue would be interesting too
 lilburlap#8480: You'd need a board game you can play without printing
 tykenn#8548: Script as in a dialogue script? I have an idea on my backlog for a crowdsourced adventure that could probably work for that theme.
 BurnV06#5857: Upload a board game somehow
 lilburlap#8480: Or have fun with emergent storytelling/gameplay
 BurnV06#5857: Just upload a blank unity project lol
 Selviam#7268: imagine the game theme being "make a game with no script"
 BurnV06#5857: Yeah. For a game idea I have I have an idea for a puzzle where a platform is too high to jump on so you have to bring a box from another dimension to make it reachable
 NARC in training#8398: probably C
 Selviam#7268: wdym by pure data?
 Lawn#1538: I saw a neat game made with Pure Data last year
 tykenn#8548: I once made a game with a wall you have to pass but it's higher that your jump. I also allowed air jumping but didn't tell the player, just to see how long it would take them to try it.
 Lawn#1538: They are around, they go by Jason
 tykenn#8548: You could jump through spots because you can just always jump infinitely. (of course there are a million other problems with this approach)
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: Same, it's 2:23 AM over here lol
 birdstone#3073: goodnight
 NoelJasik#8768: i am going to sleep
 birdstone#3073: i have so much respect for them despite not knowing who they are lol
 NoelJasik#8768: you couldn't jump through spots you should be able to with this
 Selviam#7268: really? Thats so coool
 Lawn#1538: There is a Patron who is using their own engine for this jam.
 Selviam#7268: 💀
 BurnV06#5857: 12 per game
 tykenn#8548: There's an even easier and more terrible solution to coyote time: always allow air jumping
 Selviam#7268: like 12 per script?
 BurnV06#5857: it is
 BurnV06#5857: Not nearly good enough at programming lol
 birdstone#3073: i've never used gamemaker but that sounds annoying
 birdstone#3073: lmao yes
 BurnV06#5857: It doesn't let you be like, "wait this amount of time until you run the script" it makes you set a global timer and create a separate event for when the timer ends. Also you're limited to only using 12 timers for some reason
 Lawn#1538: If by tried you mean thought about it, then sure.
 birdstone#3073: out of curiousity has anybody here ever tried to make their own game engine?
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: I only used GMS2 once for a school project but I definitely prefer Unity
 birdstone#3073: solution: **write your own game engine**
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: Ah
 birdstone#3073: ohh i see
 BurnV06#5857: Gamemaker studio 2
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: Which engine do you use?
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: Ah
 BurnV06#5857: In my engine, you can either check based on the default object collider or a specific shape relative to the origin point of the player. I do the latter it avoids bugs. So my collision for the ground works differently from the other ones
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: Thought you were talking about the player collider itself
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: Ah alright
 BurnV06#5857: That's what I did
 BurnV06#5857: My engine handles waiting certain periods of time weird so yeah
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: I suppose it could also work if you make the ground check a trigger that's wider than the player but it again depends one how it's coded
 BurnV06#5857: That one didn't work so well but I don't really care. It's subtle enough you have to try very hard to line yourself up like that
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: It really just depends on how you do it
 BurnV06#5857: Worked fine when I just tried it on my game but whatever
 birdstone#3073: coyote time isn't too difficult to implement
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: You would just kinda float
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: Yeah or standing still over the edge
 birdstone#3073: i feel like that would have more disadvantages lol
 Merus#7019: how do you deal with the character being under a cliff and jumping up?
 Lawn#1538: I can see situations where that would work and also would not.
 BurnV06#5857: Off topic but I just figured out a way to make low-effort coyote time: just make the hitbox wider than the character
 6746#9763: I personally don't like discord that much but sure
 Lawn#1538: And it’s easier for mods to moderate.
 Scolon#4218: Because it pings you on discord
 NoelJasik#8768: no clue
 6746#9763: by the way why do we have to log in to discord to use the team finder? why can't we have messaging platforms other than discord?
 birdstone#3073: my brains slow and read this without eye
 steeleater#7580: another term for everyone who votes on the games in the game jam every year
 BurnV06#5857: So you can yell something like "MY EYEBALLS ARE HAIRY" into the mic and it'll make yoshi's ballooons go up
 birdstone#3073: lmfao true
 steeleater#7580: puzzle platfoomer
 cathy#3897: so was woodwind
 birdstone#3073: brass was ass
 cathy#3897: but then again ur in brass
 birdstone#3073: ohhhhh i think i remember
 BurnV06#5857: I remember one NSMB minigame tells you to blow into the microphone to make yoshi fly, but I realized you can just shout really random stuff into the mic and it'll still work
 cathy#3897: were u in gr 7 band cuz if so i remember the teacher made us play this game where you have to shout to activate your chicken and it was a platformer
 birdstone#3073: that would be so funny to watch
 tykenn#8548: I remember seeing a prototype like this at a convention once. It was some kind of racing game, but both the players were screaming at the top of their lungs because it was shout-activated.
 Nobody6502#8971: Might actually have a team 👀
 BurnV06#5857: July 15-17
 6746#9763: nice
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: This lmao
 birdstone#3073: in like 4 days lol
 IntangibleMatter#2281: Platformed-
It's a visual novel about someone who is legally distinct from Mario who is "Too old for-a this"
 6746#9763: when is the jam
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: Honestly it could work
 birdstone#3073: i would have an aneurysm trying to make it myself but its a good idea
 BurnV06#5857: pretty good
 NoelJasik#8768: so, how does my idea sound>?
 birdstone#3073: spend a day with me in real life and you'll change your mind pretty quickly lol
 Ridley#0760: they can be whatever they want to be
 BurnV06#5857: It's okay. You're not an idiot
 birdstone#3073: oh my god
 birdstone#3073: i'm an idiot i wasn't seeing what you were replying to and assumed it was shoot to move lmao
 Merus#7019: there's a lot of options!
 NoelJasik#8768: The game is a Scootem Up, you are in a amusment park of adventures, there's this whole as roller coster that drives at high speed, your goal? you need try not to fall of from the rollercoster, the catch is that you are using a scooter, that's out of gas, so you have to use a nerf cannon to move around, along the way there will be obsticles that you will have to avoid, and enemies, that you have to non-lethally remove using your nerf cannon
 birdstone#3073: "shout to move" sounds like that one mobile game i forgot
 BurnV06#5857: You could also change shooter to shouter
 NoelJasik#8768: already have 5 themes give me a while
 birdstone#3073: oh ig you already have 5 lol
 birdstone#3073: light and dark
 BurnV06#5857: Scoot to move?
 NoelJasik#8768: Okay
 Scolon#4218: ah yes scooting
 Merus#7019: genre, but change one letter (e.g. first person scooter)
 NoelJasik#8768: 1 more
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: Rollercoasters (who would've guessed lol)
 tykenn#8548: non-violent
 NoelJasik#8768: 3 more
 Merus#7019: adventureland
 NoelJasik#8768: 4 more
 BurnV06#5857: Shoot to move (for the memes)
 NoelJasik#8768: give me 5 themes and i'll turn that into a game idea
 BurnV06#5857: Blank GMS2 project
 Scolon#4218: I start with a blank unity project
 BurnV06#5857: Same
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: I don't think I could ever do that lmao
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: Honestly if you can make a game that fits 5 different themes that's already an achievement of its own regardless of how good it is lol
 NoelJasik#8768: just realized that lol
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: I mean I guess
 NoelJasik#8768: Never say no way
 Ridley#0760: do you guys usually start a blank unity project or start from a template, either one of theirs or one of something you've made
 BurnV06#5857: 5 different games is the masochistic route
 MangoWorks#1202: i got 4 so far
 tykenn#8548: I guess it's a documentary instead of a game? I didn't know steam did documentaries. But you did find something with that title, so you win.
 NoelJasik#8768: Ah, makes more sense
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: There's no way one game can fit 5 themes
 MangoWorks#1202: one game 5 jams
 NoelJasik#8768: One game for them all or 5 diffrent games?
 MangoWorks#1202: for some reason i have this really stupid and genius idea of doing 5 jams at once One of the being GMTK Jam 2022
 NoelJasik#8768: brackeys also uploaded for his own jam i think
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: I mean I feel like if you're judging the games you shouldn't count your own anyways
 NoelJasik#8768: Obviously
 NoelJasik#8768: i found a game like that through google search bruh
 BurnV06#5857: If he did participate, it would be best if he refused to make his game one of the 20 in the video no matter how good it is, to avoid bias
 tykenn#8548: It's really tempting, but imagine trying to find a game named that through a google search
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: Yeah idk if Mark is involved in choosing the theme
 NoelJasik#8768: also it's not a competition, it's for fun, the theme is there just to restrict our creative process
 NoelJasik#8768: Tbh i don't think it does, like there are many ways to avoid mark knowing the theme, like randomly choosing it from a pool of ideas
 wren#0640: goes against the spirit of game jams imo
 tykenn#8548: Weird I didn't even think about using a sub-title until now. It would open it up to the sequel that I'm definitely not going to make
 wren#0640: participating in your own jam deciding the theme beforehand is kinda scummy
 wren#0640: i doubt it
 NoelJasik#8768: Will mark make game for this jam?
 BurnV06#5857: Name Maker's Toolkit Name Jam 2022
 Lawn#1538: ~~Name Jam 2022~~ I’ll show myself out.
 NoelJasik#8768: The Name Of The Game since it's meta
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: Just combine everything lmao
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: Maybe Namesummoners: Way of the Word?
 wren#0640: way of the word flows nicely imo
 NoelJasik#8768: Named Legends, The Name The Game, Way of the Name, Summonamers
 Skrioftw#7586: Its called Project Theta
 BurnV06#5857: "Way of the Name"?
 Skrioftw#7586: I have a game concept that I've moved into preprod that I really think does have potential
 tykenn#8548: I feel like it should probably have the word "name" in its name, being a game primarily about names, so Name Fighters seems the right direction. In universe, they're called Namesummoners, so maybe that could work?
Whether I go with "Way of the Word" or not, that does seem like a fun phrase to be used by the Church of the South Words.
 NoelJasik#8768: Name calling
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: Ngl I like The Way Of The Word
 Scolon#4218: oh, nice, my unity webgl is waaaaaaaaay faster for me than it was last time pog. 5 minutes to 5 seconds for empty project
I don't know what caused that but that helps a lot
 NoelJasik#8768:  Name Ideas: Lettermans, Word Of The Hero, The Way Of The Word, Name Fighters
 cathy#3897: dude with an axe
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: That was a sentence lmao
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: Might actually go with that yeah, it's nice to have some confirmation I guess yeah if y'all also come up with that
 birdstone#3073: lumberjump or lumberjumper sounds the best to me
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: Would still be similar to what I currently have but at least a bit more attention grabbing
 NoelJasik#8768: Than just go with it, no need to overthink it
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: Yeah I've been considering Lumber Jumper as well
 NoelJasik#8768: name ideas
 NoelJasik#8768:  Lumberjump, Axeformer, Dude with an axe, The Legend Of An Axe Thrower, Axrow
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: Yeah I want to have the axe throwing be referenced in the title as well but haven't come up with anything good so far
 BurnV06#5857: Yeah. I usually take ages to think of a half-decent title that hasn't been taken.
 NoelJasik#8768: Show me that game i can come up with a one
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: Thanks!
 tykenn#8548: Titles are hard. I've been working on a game for over a year now and still haven't decided on a title
 NoelJasik#8768: Looks pretty cool
 BurnV06#5857: Yeah. tried to make it mobile friendly with controls but it doesn't fit the screen size of phones
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: As in it was playable but not all UI was visible and the tap controls felt weird but I still like it
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: I just tried to play your game as well but I'm on mobile so it didn't work completely as it should
 BurnV06#5857: crap windows only and I'm away from my desktop rn. Will play it later
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: Awesome!
 BurnV06#5857: cool I'll play it
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: Really imaginative name rn I know but I came up with it when I started and have yet to think of a more definitive title
 BurnV06#5857: Yeah. I find them really interesting
 tykenn#8548: Ah, cool, I need to rewatch those videos then
 BurnV06#5857: In basically every top 20 video, at least one game has you shoot to move. Mark Brown commented on it one year and now its a meme
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: Wait lemme link a demo of it
 NoelJasik#8768: move to shoot\
 Lawn#1538: Don’t let your dreams be dreams.
 lilburlap#8480: The ultimate racing game where you need to avoid hitting the spectators
 Yoshi#0080: still waiting on the move to move jam 😔
 Lawn#1538: One of the previous jam themes.
 NoelJasik#8768: Every gmtk jam game is shoot to move
 tykenn#8548: How did the "shoot to move" prediction even get started?
 NoelJasik#8768: That's it, shoot to stop
 BurnV06#5857: shoot to move's lowkey a meme at this point
 NoelJasik#8768: shoot to move?
 lilburlap#8480: Same-ish. Most of my skills are from making a million bajillion small projects and testing myself slightly in each one
 NoelJasik#8768: I also was like that, but after doing solo jams, i picked up some stuff, and also worked once with a great pixel artist, he shared some tips to me
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: My game is a fairly standard platformer but you can throw an axe into wooden blocks to the jump off of it
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: Sounds cool
 BurnV06#5857: Basically Galaga with Asteroids style movement
 BurnV06#5857: I did that but shorter term and for coding in gms2 with this one shooter game I made
 tykenn#8548: I really should do better at mid-size projects. I do game jams, and I lock myself into multiple-year projects, and not a lot in between.
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: Not sure if I would call it the ideal way but it did work for me and it's still fun to keep going
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: I just sort of learned most of my skills from working on a single platformer project for almost 3 years now and gradually adding more complex stuff
 lilburlap#8480: I've learned more about making music and pixel art from reading messages in this server than I have in the past month so that's definitely something
 Lawn#1538: Unless it’s an absolute cracker, I’ll fix any glaringly obvious bugs then move on.
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: Dunno for sure yet tho
 Skrioftw#7586: I can literally only program lol
 BurnV06#5857: same
 tykenn#8548: I always have it in my head that I'd expand my jam ideas post jam and it never ends up happening
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: I might if I end up liking my idea
 BurnV06#5857: I sucked at pixel art until I learned to make it from this guy named Brandon James Greer on youtube. Still can't make music tho
 Scolon#4218: Any of you guys have intent of working on your jam game post-jam?
Like I don't think I'm going to do anything other than bugfixes or polishing a few things up, I have other projects I want to work on lol
 NoelJasik#8768: i know that, i am decent at pixel art tbh, but i want to get something diffrent from my artstyle
 tykenn#8548: Detailed character faces are overrated. Simple geometric shapes are where it's at
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: Yeah art doesn't need to look incredibly detailed as long as the style is consistent and nice to look at
 IntangibleMatter#2281: TWA made me care more about some fudging squares than some of my friends in real life
 Lawn#1538: A cohesive aesthetic and plenty of juice make all the difference.
 NoelJasik#8768: Dm me some samples
 Misterdll#9126: Pixel art
 Lawn#1538: Thomas Was Alone has taught me that game art can be simple and still absolutely slay.
 NoelJasik#8768: Well, what's your role?
 Misterdll#9126: I need a team tho💀
 BurnV06#5857: plus people can use opengameart.com if they suck at art or music/sfx
 NoelJasik#8768: i dmed him and well, hasn't responded yet
 Skrioftw#7586: At least I don't consider myself one
 cathy#3897: ah
 Skrioftw#7586: They mentioned seasoned dev and Im not that lol
 cathy#3897: ^
 cathy#3897: welp there was just an artist looking for a team so
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: This will be me first jam so I'll see how that plays out lmao
 Scolon#4218: Slowly grinding up each skill is fun
 Skrioftw#7586: I can't draw to save my life
 NOAH 🇺🇦#5962: Yeah I prefer working solo as well
 Scolon#4218: Not once you've had a lot of experience doing everything
 Lawn#1538: I dig the personal challenge of making something on your own too.
 cathy#3897: is it difficult to fill all roles yourself?
 Scolon#4218: Yeah working solo is very free, no need to worry about conflicting ideas
 Lawn#1538: I would like to work in team, but I like the creative freedom of working solo.
 Scolon#4218: Slowmode usually gets increased to like 1 minute on jam day
 Skrioftw#7586: Im still on the prowl for a team
 Scolon#4218: There's always a huge wave of excitement day before and day of
 wren#0640: yeah i imagine theres gonna be a huge influx the day of the theme announcement
 Lawn#1538: The first wave of jammers seem to have found their teammates pretty quickly it seems. No doubt there will be another wave over the coming days.
 Scolon#4218: Who needs a team anyways
 Micro (ig - musoukasan )#4281: Understandable, np
 BurnV06#5857: Everyone else: *desperately trying to find a team* Me: *laughs in social anxiety*
 Merus#7019: Sorry it is an automatic reflex at this point
 Micro (ig - musoukasan )#4281: "I'll also post on teamfinder, texting here cause some teams stopped looking there would still be open."
Ty nevertheless
 Merus#7019: Check out 
 DrNukeLear#2414: Morning
 Scolon#4218: hi
 NoelJasik#8768: Hey
 Micro (ig - musoukasan )#4281: Hey guys, I'm looking for a team with seasoned devs. 2d Artist with previous 4 years of game design and programming (CS/Unity/iOS) - focus on art this jam. I'll also post on teamfinder, texting here cause some teams stopped looking there would still be open.
I can also use blender or minimal animation.
 Reemus#7953: ...personally disgusted with his character.
 Reemus#7953: *checks server member list first*
 Reemus#7953: If only I were not...
 Reemus#7953: The idea was solid though, if we kept working on it and added levels it could become a proper game...
 Reemus#7953: But the programmer, alone, could not get everything done in time.
 Reemus#7953: The artist did great, love that style.
 Reemus#7953: Thanks, it is the best one I managed to design so far.
 Selviam#7268: great game 👍
 birdstone#3073: its always great when things work out with peapole
 NoelJasik#8768: the only time i worked with 3 peapole, we did the game design togheter, and the game turned out pretty good, there were few issues, as i wasn't that expiranced back than but i think it worked out well for us
 Reemus#7953: So fast-forward I am too burnt out of trying to manage people, so I want to contribute to someone else's team and just support as a game-designer and writer.
 NoelJasik#8768: like if you have a big team, yeah for sure, but like 3-4 peapole, i think it's managable
 Reemus#7953: I took them in, and it backfired.
 Reemus#7953: Of course, it does. We took in some external people, who really wanted to get their ideas in.
 Reemus#7953: If the teammembers are okay with delegating most game design and idea issues to you, there should be no problem.
 Skrioftw#7586: I think it ultimately depends on the team
 NoelJasik#8768: but i am i think decent at game design, and also enjoy it, i worked multiple times with someone who didn't want to touch game design at all, and just left that whole aspect to me
 birdstone#3073: ^ our team is very tight knit so it's easier to make decisions with everyone's equal input
 cathy#3897: well yeah just depends on how ur team works
 Reemus#7953: One of my worst jam games is the one where I tried to take everyone's ideas into consideration, and we ended up "brainstorming" for three days, ultimately giving up because we could not agree what better fits the theme.
 Skrioftw#7586: ^
 NoelJasik#8768: It really depends on the peapole, i usually like the democratic way of game design, and don't feel like getting a whole game designer role
 Reemus#7953: One of my most successful jam game is the result of me taking programmer's idea and elaborating on it.
 Reemus#7953: Of course, UNTIL the work begins, during the "brainstorming" phase.
 birdstone#3073: we literally have worked together and witness our team fighting each other lmao
 Skrioftw#7586: I mean yeah thats why game designers exist, but Everyone should still be able to have input
 Reemus#7953: This.
 cathy#3897: thats partially true but in my expierence there should be somebody thats mainly in charge cuz arguments can arise easily
 Selviam#7268: so your a concept artist?
 Reemus#7953: Everyone can only specialize in so many fields.
 Skrioftw#7586: Very True, your game should have Ideas that stem from everyone
 Reemus#7953: Yes but I specialize in them.
 Merus#7019: But the developers also have ideas
 Reemus#7953: I wish to do the same here, just find someone else to code and draw, so I can help them make a cool game!
 Reemus#7953: I am a certified idea guy, I do game design on paper for implementation by developers.
 Reemus#7953: I am looking for the rare ones.
 Beeg scarf#3571: let him be the ideas guy while youre the performance/bugs guy
 cathy#3897: tbf theres only like 4 days so better get ur team together quick
 Skrioftw#7586: I made a small turn based rpg for my CS class and I had to pretty much do all of it myself since my 2 partners didn't do anything lol
 tykenn#8548: I make sure I always have a second project, so I procrastinate by working on the project I didn't plan to work on instead of the one I did, and keep my procrastination productive that way
 JuliusCube#8501: i also have to do some jam prep because ive decided to work with my friend who has *literally never used any sort of game engine* so that will be fun
or exhausting
i cant tell which one
 caibi#2508: ~~make a jam game just like copy amd paste your old code togheter and make a new game~~
 NoelJasik#8768: no, i only procrastinate on actual work, so don't worry, i mean i only need a team, what else is there to prep?
 JuliusCube#8501: yeah thats fair, but if youre anything like me youll just procrastinate on the prep until you forget what the word prep means
 NoelJasik#8768: this is capitalism
 birdstone#3073: :(
 NoelJasik#8768: yes
 tykenn#8548: Yeah, much easier to wing it by yourself that with a team
 birdstone#3073: lol were you about to try to recruit one of my team members
 NoelJasik#8768: I am also usually like that, but i want to get actual team this time, and that kinda needs prep
 caibi#2508: true
 Skrioftw#7586: Im just nervous since its my first jam
 Lawn#1538: All people are different.
 JuliusCube#8501: idk why people do so much jam prep
i just look at the theme and do a thing its not that complicated
 NoelJasik#8768: i want to spice stuff up
 NoelJasik#8768: i always made jam games alone
 caibi#2508: what about make it alone
 Skrioftw#7586: got 2 more years left in my degree
 NoelJasik#8768: Oh, well i am the same, also looking for a team
 Skrioftw#7586: Programmer, Im a junior dev
 JuliusCube#8501: which makes it even harder to predict
 JuliusCube#8501: well yeah theres also no theme voting its all just mark using his braincells
 Foxgirl-Techsupport#6831: Which dont get me wrong is good but does make pre jam prep hard
 Skrioftw#7586: Only when I need to absolutly crunch
 NoelJasik#8768: well what's your role?
 NoelJasik#8768: well do you drink a lot of energy drinks? like i drank 2l of energy drinks back than, after i stopped i started feeling better
 Skrioftw#7586: I just hope I can find a team lol
 JuliusCube#8501: theres no more math chat in general sad
 Foxgirl-Techsupport#6831: Agreed but it just means they're hard to predict/prepare for
 NoelJasik#8768: F
 Skrioftw#7586: I tried that at one point and i didnt get any results
 birdstone#3073: this is slander
 lilburlap#8480: Daniel that's illegal
 cathy#3897: what
 birdstone#3073: what
 JuliusCube#8501: which makes the themes different and extremely good themes
 cathy#3897: yeah ive been kidnapped by dan
 Foxgirl-Techsupport#6831: I've noticed the themes are always something that affects the basic mechanics and not the style or gameplay loop like other jams
 NoelJasik#8768: dude, start taking vitamins, i also was like that but since i started taking that shit i don't feel like dying every day
 birdstone#3073: YOU'RE MY ARTIST
 JuliusCube#8501: thats definitely a good thing to do
 Skrioftw#7586: Im just constantly sleep deprived
 Foxgirl-Techsupport#6831: Yep I have character controller templates that feel good for every 2d genre or most atleast. I've taken part in alot of weeklong jams so I sat down and made templates one night, who knows maybe I'll publish it as an asset one day
 NoelJasik#8768: you got a team?
 cathy#3897: yeah, im an artist not a dev but usually i get all my ideas when im tired so i just draw a quick doodle for when im fully concious
 NoelJasik#8768: Shoot to move MMORPG with NFTs and lootboxes
 lilburlap#8480: It'd be funny if the theme was "Winning" or something like that
 JuliusCube#8501: yes very cool
 Selviam#7268: hmm i hope its something easy to code
 Beeg scarf#3571: Shoot to move
 NoelJasik#8768: if you feel like your game is easy, make it easier, all games are way harder than the developer thinks
 JuliusCube#8501: okay dumb question but what do you guys think the theme will be
 birdstone#3073: definitely, gl
 lilburlap#8480: I come up with most of my ideas while tired because I'm not self-conscious about them but I definitely don't do better work
 Foxgirl-Techsupport#6831: k, thanks I'll make sure to keep things simple so i have the time for that
 Selviam#7268: ill program in the morning when im more awake and draw at night when im more creative
 NoelJasik#8768: make sure you forget basic human functions like eating and sleeping, it's a waste of time and resources
 JuliusCube#8501: make your character fun to control
and also remember basic human bodily functions
 Skrioftw#7586: I program at my best when Im sleep deprived lol
 birdstone#3073: i think i lost a full night of sleep my first jam because of build problems
 birdstone#3073: make sure you don't forget basic human functions like eating and sleeping lmao
 Selviam#7268: im gonna buy my favorite coffee icecream to keep me up 💪
 NoelJasik#8768: they also chew coffe grounds in the army to stay awake
 Beeg scarf#3571: have a small scope test the game a lot dont make the game *too* hard
 Skrioftw#7586: I simply drink NOS
 birdstone#3073: wtf
 NoelJasik#8768: remeber cocaine is pretty effective at waking you up
 Foxgirl-Techsupport#6831: Hahaha the duality of humans
 Betshet#4658: 💵 <- here's a tip
15%
 Beeg scarf#3571: 2 kinds of people
 NoelJasik#8768: Say goodbye to sleep
 Lawn#1538: Eat well, sleep well.
 Skrioftw#7586: Never sleep
 Foxgirl-Techsupport#6831: Hi, this is my first time working on a 2 day long jam. Any tips?
 Selviam#7268: my last game jam was a week long so im a bit nervous to do this with less than half the time
 Beeg scarf#3571: dont forget squash and stretch
 Beeg scarf#3571: got it
 JuliusCube#8501: oh that as well
 lilburlap#8480: 1 thing that works really well for single sprite characters is leaning them in the direction they're moving
 redka#6365: we use dev tools to make the process easier
 NoelJasik#8768: Just make agario duh
 JuliusCube#8501: i feel like i may be a little too overhyped for this game jam
 snuffysam#2767: which i've seen in a game jam... there was one, game i played where you were mice eating cheese iirc
basically collectively digging tunnels in the terrain
 redka#6365: not at all, we're removing dwelling over how to implement basic stuff is all
 NoelJasik#8768: big teams can be pretty hard, like you need very good organziation, i don't think 10 random peapole would be able to do good on jam, 10 friends on the other hand, that are on the same level, for sure
 Beeg scarf#3571: wouldnt that produce feature creep? not to mention having issues with minimum viable product if the end result is not that fun
 JuliusCube#8501: for people who dont know how to do this, here is what you need to do:
-coyote time
-non-floaty jump
-jump buffer
- different air and ground acceleration
also: particles or some sort of change for the player when you are moving
these are the basic things i always have
 birdstone#3073: not really, i scored pretty high and had quite a bit of votes in a team of two last year
 redka#6365: depends, not always
 Selviam#7268: are the top-rated games in game jams usually made with big teams?
 redka#6365: we made stream classes so we can forget about the "how" of exchanging information between puzzle elements, and focus on the "how" of the mechanics and content blocks
 BurnV06#5857: yeah. I have a platformer character controller I made after being inspired by MB's interactive video essay. Might use that idk
 redka#6365: we differentiate content from features - we want to spend majority of the jam adding unique features and content, not dwelling over architecture and such
 JuliusCube#8501: already done
 birdstone#3073: make your character fun to control
 JuliusCube#8501: as in, i have to remove the junk each time i want to use it again
 redka#6365: thats the idea
 JuliusCube#8501: but the problem with that for me is that my character controllers all have the same core that works fine but I add a bunch of junk on top of it for the specific game im making
 NoelJasik#8768: i'll add that to my MMORPG
 NoelJasik#8768: perfect idea, i am gonna do that rn
 birdstone#3073: i remember one theme i saw somewhere that was like "you're doing that genre wrong"
 BravoDS (Music/SFX)#0694: NFT and Lootboxes ))
 NoelJasik#8768: it's not like i always do that
 JuliusCube#8501: i feel like that should be common knowledge
 gamedevperson#8448: **the theme: 2 game genres**
 JuliusCube#8501: agree, nobody does
or worse a buggy game
 redka#6365: pro tip: instead of spending 3 hours finetuning a character controller, rip out a character controller from a game you made before
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: 100% possible, it's been done in years past. Most of them work with a websocket relay IIRC
 birdstone#3073: i dont want to make a bad game
 NoelJasik#8768: it needs to support a lot of players, and be a rpg, it's duable in 2 days
 Merus#7019: Best of luck, anyway
 JuliusCube#8501: guys, its not a good idea to say what you want to make in a game jam. you probably wont be able to execute it well. its a way better idea to say what you *dont* want to make in a game jam. because you can actually avoid those things pretty easily
 Merus#7019: I have thought about how you'd do this - I think it's _possible_ so long as you pare back to just "a game that runs on a web server where you can interact with other players a bit"
 birdstone#3073: just aim for general audiences, for example like there's a bunch of people that aren't comfortable with horror
 redka#6365: its more of a mechanics and design challenge, but by default you should be able to do a lot of stuff
 Beeg scarf#3571: platformers are versatile im sure itll do, the real issue is if you find a better idea that cant be done with a platformer
 NoelJasik#8768: btw hey  i remember ya
 Skrioftw#7586: I've never participated in a game jam before
 redka#6365: usually the jam doesnt restrict genre
 birdstone#3073: solution: make a program that randomly generates music
 BurnV06#5857: I'm probably gonna make a platformer, but I might not if it can't fit the theme
 redka#6365: puzzle games are my bread and butter
 JuliusCube#8501: i kinda understand it
its like the amount of beats over the type of note
 NoelJasik#8768: Tbh this is a pretty generic mechanic, and i would treat that the same way as reusing a movement script
 redka#6365: we have a rule: no content we build in prototypes can be used in final game, only controllers and interfaces are allowed
 Merus#7019: So you've already decided to make a puzzle game for the jam?
 BurnV06#5857: good luck
 redka#6365: we're making something that's just a way to make puzzle games and puzzle circuits without wanting to shoot yourself in the foot
 Beeg scarf#3571: bfxr my beloved
 cathy#3897: its the amount of beats per bar of music or osmething
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Depends, you can use tools for multiple projects depending on how versatile you make them
 NoelJasik#8768: i am gonna make a MMORPG game to prove that it's possible during a game jam
 Beeg scarf#3571: so you could have other 7 people telling you what a time signature is
 birdstone#3073: oh my
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Bless
 redka#6365: yes, our game will be an MMORPG with 40 hours of gameplay on release day
 SlamBamActionman#7160: With NFTs
 SlamBamActionman#7160: So everything but an MMORPG then?
 redka#6365: we also pre-emptively eliminated genres and mechanics we can't handle
 JuliusCube#8501: 8 people is a lot lmao
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: smart!
 redka#6365: we agreed on an aesthetic and compiled a moodboard of things we like
 unityAccount#7810: I think one guy should only deal with organisation and management when it comes to such teams
 redka#6365: its just useful bits of abstraction that help us not get caught up in the how of information exchange
 JuliusCube#8501: why do so many people have big teams like im here working by myself struggling to figure out what a time signature is
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: how are you planning to maintain a consistent artstyle?
 redka#6365: it helps read the situation, not make it
 unityAccount#7810: Isn't that a biiiiiiit of cheating? Preparing such specific tools isn't the same as practising
 redka#6365: 3 artists, designer, 3 programmers, musician
 birdstone#3073: oh god, coordinating a team above 4 would be a nightmare for me lol
 redka#6365: 8, in full
 redka#6365: oh sorry didnt count 2 people who were offline
 birdstone#3073: damn
 redka#6365: 6 people
 birdstone#3073: how big is your team?
 redka#6365: yeah, we are adding a tool that lets you view connections between Stream objects like Buttons, Doors etc.
 birdstone#3073: jeez you guys are going all out huh lol
 redka#6365: we're building dev tools
 birdstone#3073: i typically get my idea within the first half hour or hour and mold it as i go, it works really well for me
 gamedevperson#8448: my vs license is out oof
 redka#6365: we have the itch page with credits and UI sketches
 JuliusCube#8501: i say that like that is a plan but its not because whenever i make a plan it never works because i procrastinate
 JuliusCube#8501: ill at least try to have an idea 4-5 hours after theme announcement
 Scolon#4218: Last time I participated I did things way too late
 birdstone#3073: that's a good plan
 Scolon#4218: I'll try to have something playable within like 4-5 hours of theme announcement
 gamedevperson#8448: thats not a bad idea
 birdstone#3073: hello
 birdstone#3073: the most preparation i do is like a day or two before the jam where i'll just do some simple tests, my team and i do sort of "idea exercises" where we just use a theme generator and brainstorm ideas
 gamedevperson#8448: ello chat
 birdstone#3073: lol testing before the jam is always good
 Scolon#4218: I should probably go and create a set of temporary/placeholder sprites
 redka#6365: and its a nice way to introduce our artists to version control too
 Scolon#4218: Oh yeah
 redka#6365: we were able to identify a lot of issues in our development this way
 birdstone#3073: ooo that might be ambitious but i'd be down to play a portal like game
 redka#6365: so we're doing a test project with generic puzzle mechanics
 redka#6365: we want a robust solution for some big problems like puzzle data flow, design process etc.
 birdstone#3073: lol i'm leaving all the music in control with my friend, he made a really good soundtrack for last year
 JuliusCube#8501: also do the player a favor please and make the companion cube farther from the player when they pick it up
 redka#6365: portal is the base for what we're testing
 birdstone#3073: oh yeah, that reminded me of portal
 JuliusCube#8501: portal?
 birdstone#3073: it takes like half an hour on my old laptop for webgl builds but on my new one it takes like a minute
 Scolon#4218: I've gotten a lot faster at prototyping but the Web-GL build time for unity is soooooooooo long
 JuliusCube#8501: chrome music lab as a music making thing for game development would be the worst thing i could imagine
idk why im saying this
 redka#6365: in Godot
 birdstone#3073: WHOAA first person, that's really cool
 birdstone#3073: if youre doing a more puzzley/strategy type game then personally i wouldn't care about a highscore, i'd just feel accomplished from finding my own solution
 redka#6365: we decided to just test some basic physics, movement and interactions
 Scolon#4218: Heh nice, I'm gonna run some tests later today
 unityAccount#7810: I am just unsure if just trying to set a high score is as much fun as finishing all levels, which makes you feel like you've beaten the game
 Scolon#4218: There's no way you're mixing procedural generation and puzzle games in a really impactful way, not in a game jam experience atleast
 birdstone#3073: true that
 Scolon#4218: It just depends on how complex your game is
 birdstone#3073: yeah it's super hard to randomly generate meaningful levels
 Scolon#4218: Infinite is definitely easier for game jam, but a set of a few nicely hand-crafted levels that showcase your ideas also works
 snuffysam#2767: depends on how much detail you put into generation
 birdstone#3073: after the jam i tried molding it into a roguelike which worked but i was lazy and never finished it lmao
 Reemus#7953: If you can do that, for sure, be my guest, but maybe the theme will be just too hard.
 birdstone#3073: i think that's what i tried last year, i ended up doing an infinite arena sort of thing since i was low on time
 Reemus#7953: Being bent on making one genre before you know the theme, and not be willing to think for something MORE fitting to the theme, is kinda... not how I would do it.
 Scolon#4218: You could probably shoehorn something but I'm going to make the theme a heavy part of the core mechanics
 Reemus#7953: True, but...
 wren#0640: i feel like roguelike is a genre you can shoehorn a theme into pretty easily
 unityAccount#7810: I wonder if making an infinite game would be better than making one with levels. On one hand, it is easier to make I think, but on the other hand, I am not sure how much fun it can be.
 birdstone#3073: oooo definitely share it once you've finished, i'd love to play it
 Reemus#7953: But the theme...
 Scolon#4218: I'm definitely making some sort of roguelike
 birdstone#3073: i deliberately canceled some plans just to make time for the jam lol
 birdstone#3073: true true
 birdstone#3073: lol fair, things like roguelikes or cave generation always catches my attention
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: 🏃‍♂️ 💨
 birdstone#3073: that's like 10% of the time given lol
 Jeker#3389: Indeed, i've also only made platformers, so i want to make something else lol
 unityAccount#7810: Anything I can bring together in like 5 hours
 birdstone#3073: procedural generation is so cool
 IntangibleMatter#2281: Thinking some sort of rhythm game might be fun
 Jeker#3389: I want to make something with procedural generation
 RocketCow#5210: For this game jam I will create an accounting suite
 Lawn#1538: Then you’re one step ahead of me Shadow.
 Lawn#1538: A trick I use a lot is to sample my VSTs that don’t need to be tweaked too much and bring them into a Simpler instrument. You can run a ridiculous number of Simplers with very little cost to the CPU. Drum racks in live are basically a bunch of stacked Simpler devices.
 Lawn#1538: Much like game dev.
 Lawn#1538: Knowing how to optimise a set is pretty key to having a nice experience.
 ron0studios#4591: that probably explains it haha
 ron0studios#4591: im pretty bad at managing my PC
 Lawn#1538: Performance is a tough one to troubleshoot. I used a 2011 MacBook Pro for like eight years with zero issues with performance. Not a single show did it ever crash or produce latency either.
 ron0studios#4591: hello!
 wormius#9617: hello
 PyxelGamesStudios#2803: Hi Guys 😄
 Lawn#1538: The routing options in Live are just the bees knees.
 ron0studios#4591: the main downside for me is that I'm having to freeze tracks very quickly on my laptop. Performance can be a bit of an issue sometimes
 ron0studios#4591: I like how you can chain effects in ableton, and having all automation within the track helps keep things compact as well
 Lawn#1538: It actually took me a few tries to get into the Live workflow, but once you do it’s like nothing else.
 Lawn#1538: Having used all the major and minor DAWs over almost 20 years, you’ve made a good choice. Live is unique amongst the rest, and coupled with Max it’s in another league entirely.
 ron0studios#4591: lol
 IntangibleMatter#2281: My dad was a sound engineer so I grew up on Logic but I took to FL like a duck took to water
 ron0studios#4591: my decision paralysis is unreal, so I just try and pick something and not look back
 ron0studios#4591: there are so many options 😫
 NitramiuZ#4145: I've used FL for 4 years but tried ableton just this week. Ableton has a different structure for sure, and I get why people may prefer it but for me ableton feels less fun to use
 BravoDS (Music/SFX)#0694: As a big Reaper fan, I must admit that FL Studio is a great DAW for creating music. Studio One is also very friendly towards home producers.
 JuliusCube#8501: didnt mean to be mean, was just saying
 ron0studios#4591: wow thats lovely
 IntangibleMatter#2281: When I worked as a dishwasher (that lasted about a month) what I bought with my first paycheque was FL Producer Edition
 IntangibleMatter#2281: I love FL
 ron0studios#4591: Im currently using ableton, which has a pretty clunky midi interface, but its really comfortable to work with, for me personally
 JuliusCube#8501: great DAW
 JuliusCube#8501: completely agree
 ron0studios#4591: fl studio is awesome
 ron0studios#4591: srry i was just curious 👀
 JuliusCube#8501: but fl studio because ive used it multiple times even though some people say its overused
 JuliusCube#8501: i dont need a full tutorial on how to make music (i can do that just fine), im just saying that I probably should start practicing
 ron0studios#4591: right
what software are you using?
 JuliusCube#8501: no idea, just nothing 8-bit
well something that is similar to the songs in outer wilds and i guess thats it
 JuliusCube#8501: i agree it is useful a lot but not always
 ron0studios#4591: what are you planning on making?
 ron0studios#4591: ah sorry I only just joined in
 JuliusCube#8501: actually its never what im going for
 JuliusCube#8501: well yeah but thats often not what im going for
 ron0studios#4591: you'd be surprised at how much you can accomplish with drums and an 8-bit melody
 wren#0640: you can definitely be minimalistic with music
 JuliusCube#8501: you cant (really) be minimalistic with music, and I also am just not naturally talented with it
 JuliusCube#8501: because thats the thing im worst at
 JuliusCube#8501: i should probably start practicing my music making skills
 Power#2757: Hi
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: My phone is about to die, so I gotta go!
 wren#0640: hi!
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Wren!!! Its been too long!! Hi!
 NoelJasik#8768: yeah
 Wokarol#0940: Remember kids, disable that fricking compression because otherwise it will break
 NoelJasik#8768: WebGL built, i love how that shit always breaks
 Wokarol#0940: Oh, and of course my WebGL build will be built for the first time half an hour before the jam ends adding adrenaline to that fricking long loading bar
 Wokarol#0940: Nah, I like living dangerously
 Scolon#4218: Practice building your game before the jam guys so you don't crash and burn 💀
 NoelJasik#8768: tbh fun and enjoyment means the same in this context
 Hederlunden#3231: I like that they changed it, all games don't have to be fun
 snuffysam#2767: i guess technically there's ways to have enjoyment that aren't fun. like reading a good book lol
 birdstone#3073: good luck!
 Selviam#7268: ill try to do my best to shoot for good presentation im decent enough at art for that 👍
 birdstone#3073: oh so basically nothing has changed lmao
 birdstone#3073: me too actually
 snuffysam#2767: so, same criteria, different names lol
 IntangibleMatter#2281: Honestly same. I might have to become a Patron this year
 snuffysam#2767: The criteria listed on the Itch page are Enjoyment, Creativity, Presentation
last year it was Fun, Originality, and Presentation
 Shimp#0064: I wonder how many meme games will be on the jam
 birdstone#3073: i forgot how fun it was to just talk here
 birdstone#3073: damn
 Shimp#0064: No worries
 Selviam#7268: cool! 👍
 Scolon#4218: There is a presentation category
edit: wrong reply
 theChief#0001: Yep everything will do this 😂 there are a couple of commands to run to fix. I'll write a post during the jam for how to fix!
 birdstone#3073: i'm not sure, i remember presentation was a category last year
 Shimp#0064: Sending my games to my friends sometimes doesn't work out
 Selviam#7268: is there a category for graphics at all?
 birdstone#3073: out of curiousity is yours an m1?
 Shimp#0064: Its a problem even for me on windows
 birdstone#3073: LOL
 Selviam#7268: Ohh yeah that does suck especially when i try to download my own game off of itch and my computer thinks its a *ddaaaangerous application*
 theChief#0001: I'm on a mac too 😂
 birdstone#3073: haha mac moment
definitely not using a mac as i type this
 theChief#0001: Most macOS unity games will need permissions manually setting through terminal, unfortunately! Unity and itch fail at Mac permission -_-
 birdstone#3073: actually yeah that reminds me it seems the rating categories are different than last year?
 Scolon#4218: I will review so many games
 Selviam#7268: so are there categories to be rated in?
 birdstone#3073: i started working this summer so i'll probably not be able to rate and review as many as i did last year
 snuffysam#2767: the most games i've ever rated for a game jam is 82, and that was over a full month
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: oh yeah I'm not advocating to playa nd rate quickly with no good feedback, I'm advocating for making sure that everyone who participated gets someone playing their game at least once. We don't want any games with 0 reviews unless they are unplayable
 Selviam#7268: idk what that means 🥺
 wren#0640: even though i didnt submit last year ive recognised a good few
 Selviam#7268: all my itch.io sites have just been really plane so i gotta find a way to make it look more interesting
 samcox08#6606: I'm hoping to do a lot of reviews, specially for Android and Mac, and WebGL.
 birdstone#3073: same lmao
 Roiboi#2055: It's nice to see familiar faces, I really didn't expect to recognize as many people as I did.
 nakst#1416: This year is there an incentive to get jam participants to rate other people's games? like how Ludum Dare has its "coolness" system
 birdstone#3073: lmao yeah it seems webgl builds get more ratings/reviews than downloadable ones
 theChief#0001: I take a LOT longer to do reviews, but I sort by random and record gameplay videos for everything I rate 😂
 snuffysam#2767: mm hm, i usually sort by lowest rated until i run out of playable ones, and then i sort by random to catch ones i'd have missed
 birdstone#3073: over 100 jams...
 Selviam#7268: hopefully people make their games work on mac or a web build so ill be able tto try them out
 birdstone#3073: oh god i respect that dedication lmao
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I think Dotwo did 200 one year
 birdstone#3073: oh my god the review and rating talks from last year
i think there were some people that were like racing to see who got the most votes lol
 Wokarol#0940: So... random question, who played the Outer Wilds DLC?
 Roiboi#2055: Winning isn't really the point though
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: People who are here from last year will already know that the reviews and ratings is just as much a part of the jam as making a game.
Often we start chats about "what is the best game you've found so far" etc to spread awareness of interesting submissions and we also promote going to the least reviewed games and playing them.
I for sure lead the charge on trying to get every single  game at least 1 review as fast as possible
 snuffysam#2767: what you want is to be rated early, specifically by people who don't have experience with other game jams lol
so any finished game looks good
 theChief#0001: Yep! You can never guarantee a win in a game jam 😂 you also can't control the other entries. You might knock it out of the park, make the best thing you could possibly make - but if someone else is better than you, or has a bigger team, or ran into fewer issues, or had an idea that fit the theme better, etc etc etc
 birdstone#3073: i don't think anybody would have the endurance to play and rank 1000 games lol
 snuffysam#2767: though idk about that third point, my favorite games from previous jams are ones i played really late in the rating period
 Roiboi#2055: Though I suppose that's why mark goes over the top 100 games
 birdstone#3073: luck might be a big part of it
 snuffysam#2767: though, you probably should submit as early as possible so you don't forget
 Roiboi#2055: So it really is luck at that point
 wren#0640: apparently got updated after the jam though
 theChief#0001: Can't rate til the end of the jam, so that doesn't make any difference!
 snuffysam#2767: the second-to-last person didn't include a download link at all... but i guess they had at least a screenshot on their page
 theChief#0001: I'm 50/50 split between doing some jams to be hyper competitive (with myself) and try get better ratings than previous jam games, and doing others to learn something new
 Roiboi#2055: Wouldn't that just mean submitting as early as possible?
 wren#0640: the lowest ranked playable game from last year is honestly not that bad?
 birdstone#3073: i requested and got a day off work to make enough time lmao
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: things like missing DLLS is exactly why I suggest practicing uploading your game
 birdstone#3073: great advice lmao
 Roiboi#2055: Some people will be missing in my team which might lead to some complications
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I'm surprised that wasn't removed
 theChief#0001: To "win", you generally will need:
- a really good game, of course. It needs to be a standout entry in its genre. You can control that, to some extent. However, you also need:
- not too many people to play it, because if everyone has played it you're more likely to get a few grumpy 1 star reviewers
- the people who did play it to have played it early, while they're still positive and haven't played anything they enjoy more
- players who don't enjoy the genre need to avoid it completely
Most of that is out of your control 😂
 snuffysam#2767: yup, i was correct, last place from last year is someone who didn't package their unity build properly so they were missing DLLs
 birdstone#3073: yeah, communication is so much easier and i've known them for a long time so i know how they work
 lilburlap#8480: Oh yeah I was doing that in the 2020 jam and it was fun
 birdstone#3073: i'm working with some irl friends, one's a musician/composer and another's an artist
 NoelJasik#8768: i am currently looking for a team, and the hardest part is that everyone i write to already has one
 birdstone#3073: true
 Roiboi#2055: It's just a virus
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: for some people. Other people find it enjoyable to change the win or to try and beat their previous score etc. Everyone is different
 snuffysam#2767: it's not some ride to hell retribution thing lol, it'll just be a game that crashes on opening
 wren#0640: seems likely
 snuffysam#2767: yes, just scroll all the way to the last page
though, i haven't checked, but i'm willing the bet the last place game is just a game that didn't run properly
 Roiboi#2055: That might actually be more difficult considering not even that many people submitted last time
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yes the results are still on itch.io#
 birdstone#3073: it's more enjoyable when you focus on just having fun making a game than it is focusing on end results
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: there are teams that want to score highly or win so of course they will take only the most experienced or talented. However there's also the majority of people who want to finish a game or learn new tools or enjoy themselves etc and lots of those would be happy to take less experienced people
 wren#0640: wait actually is there any way of knowing the *last* place games from previous jams?
 birdstone#3073: and you get to talk to and learn from more experienced developers and gain more skills
 JuliusCube#8501: agree
 GameboyFunny101#0057: everybody is trying to get a lower number, but from what I have learned from 1st grade math, more is better which is why I will be trying to get #15000 this game jam
 Roiboi#2055: Exactly!
 NoelJasik#8768: i mean it's not like this is a competition, in a sense you aren't paying to enter, this is for fun and to learn
 birdstone#3073: yes, as long as you're proud of what you've made then it's worth it
 birdstone#3073: i always score high on presentation, i think i was 20th last year
 theChief#0001: Don't be comparing yourself to other games. If you're in the top 10-20% consider yourself to have done a GREAT job - getting any higher is down to a bunch of things that are out of your control
 JuliusCube#8501: i just beat platformer toolkit without using the toolkit for some reason
it wasnt pleasant
 snuffysam#2767: i mean, is this an issue? the winners of the jam are the best games that could reasonably be made, and the less experienced people get experience making a finished game
 NoelJasik#8768: #372 in that
 NoelJasik#8768: i always score high on orginality
 birdstone#3073: last years results surprised me
 birdstone#3073: oooo that's really good
 birdstone#3073: definitely
 NoelJasik#8768: mine was #716, that's kinda high
 theChief#0001: Unironically love it - it's one of my favourite books of all time. I think it's so well done! Aren't I _cultured_
 Roiboi#2055: Surprisingly good for our very first game jam
 birdstone#3073: either way its mostly a good learning experience
 GameboyFunny101#0057: I think there is a huge gap when it comes to game jams. The experienced people end up with the experienced people, and the newbies want to be with the experienced people, but are stuck with other newbies
 birdstone#3073: oh hey that's pretty good
 Roiboi#2055: #1455
 NoelJasik#8768: well we can always ~~elimnate our competition using weapons of mass destruction~~ accept that sometimes things don't go our way
 JuliusCube#8501: i know, last year i just had 0 time to actually upload the non-buggy version of the game which was completed before the time limit
 lilburlap#8480: If I just read Mary Shelleys frankenstien I'd be asking that too I made it halfway through that book before getting too confused to continue
 birdstone#3073: which place?
 Roiboi#2055: Our game somehow got in the top 25% last year
 birdstone#3073: lmfao dammit
 snuffysam#2767: i have to leave to catch a plane right after the 48 hours end so i'm not gonna use those bonus hours anyway 😅
 birdstone#3073: there's so much talent here
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: never heard of it
 IntangibleMatter#2281: Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, *what do you think?*
 theChief#0001: If my game doesn't make it into the top 20 then ~~all my bribery will have been for naught~~ that would be perfectly reasonable because there's a lot of talent this year
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: no the 2 bonus hours are for linking your game on itch not for changing it or adding anything to it. You have 48 hours to make and finish and upload your game. You have 2 hours grace of finishing the export and upload just in case. Do not look at it as 2 hours extra time for the game
 JuliusCube#8501: good
 Mark Brown#6982: Nah, was just a joke - each year is a blank slate 👌
 birdstone#3073: what did i read
 NoelJasik#8768: Thanks for the heads up, i know i'll start exporting 5 minutes before the 2 bonus hours end anyways
 JuliusCube#8501: 2 bonus hours? finally so people wont have to play a broken game
 IntangibleMatter#2281: Senpai Mark we beg you
 Roiboi#2055: New prediction:
We will remember and bring up this specific moment next year for some reason
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Remember as well that this year thee are 2 bonus hours for submitting the game and then submissions will close. There is no extra "email Mark if you missed it" this year. You **must** get your game in on time please do NOT leave it to the last moment and please practice
Make a blank game with a box that moves from side to side. Export it, put it on itch and test that it works. Yoou have 5 days to practice this it will save you so much time if you just make sure you know how to export, upload and link your game in itch
 lilburlap#8480: Is he tho?
 birdstone#3073: mark isn't the kind of person to do that lmao
 JuliusCube#8501: if I somehow get my game into top 20, all i want is to not be introduced as "the discord creeper"
which i dont think mark will do cuz he seems like a nice guy
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: ayy, mark’s in chat, I’ve still not recovered from when he played my game on stream (jk mark it was great feedback)
 Hobusu#5033: He said it was his *goal*, not that he'd succeed at it!
 IntangibleMatter#2281: Tbf Mark could breathe and he'd whip up the crowd
 lilburlap#8480: What fun is a quiet crowd?
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: "I'm not going to whip up the crowd this year" he says, whipping up the crowd
 birdstone#3073: please i'd love to witness this
 IntangibleMatter#2281: I now need to hear Mark to say this during the theme announcement while explaining why you shouldn't spam him about your game or something
 birdstone#3073: WAIT i didn't even realized we talked last year lmfao its good to see you again
 JuliusCube#8501: trust me, there are worse things he has said in discord than that
 Roiboi#2055: Yeah lol
 birdstone#3073: oh hey i'm in that screenshot
 lilburlap#8480: This is why we switched to redline mark
 Roiboi#2055: Remember this
 birdstone#3073: with the narrator tone
 snuffysam#2767: imagining that said out loud in the presentational cadence of any of mark's videos
 Mark Brown#6982: My goal this year is to be zen and not whip up the crowd
 lilburlap#8480: Darn I should've been here last year it sounds like I missed out
 NoelJasik#8768: and there's a reasone why i always post last possible second
 birdstone#3073: i remember a lot of questionable things mark said last year lol
 JuliusCube#8501: lmao
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: There's a reason we say give at least 4 hours to get your game exported and submitted, and there also a reason that we advise submitting a version at the end of day 1 so that is everything else goes completely catastrophically wrong you still have something there
 lilburlap#8480: The more they try to fix it the more we break it
 birdstone#3073: itch becomes a store on black friday on every gmtk jam
 lilburlap#8480: I only saw that in the video I was busy trying to make a cannon not dissappear
 NoelJasik#8768: it's a tradition
 birdstone#3073: lmao it seems it just gets bigger every year
 NoelJasik#8768: it happens every gmtk lol
 JuliusCube#8501: twice
 Roiboi#2055: Yeah
 birdstone#3073: remember when itch died because of how many people were submitting to the jam
 JuliusCube#8501: well game jams are all about having fun, so i guess i will
 NoelJasik#8768: mark is forshadowing the theme is caves omg
 Roiboi#2055: My prediction remains as "limited information"
Calling it here
 lilburlap#8480: 🧭 Compasses have magnets in them right?
 birdstone#3073: thank you for hosting these amazing jams!
 Mark Brown#6982: Anyway, thank you all for taking part in the jam! I hope you dig the theme and have fun!
 JuliusCube#8501: 2 then
 NoelJasik#8768: there's clearly 2
 JuliusCube#8501: only one i think
 NoelJasik#8768: 🧲
 JuliusCube#8501: *emote
 birdstone#3073: oh that reminds me, mark drew his own profile picture i think
 lilburlap#8480: Oh yeah that'd be a problem
 BadPiggy#5202: Sounds more like he went through a conviction arc
 JuliusCube#8501: probably not, i just dont set my profile picture as badly drawn luigi or ping mark 40 times
 FartFish#1048: Clearly i have missed out on something
 birdstone#3073: i spent a bit of time just talking and getting to know other developers
 JuliusCube#8501: which in my opinion is better than "discord creeper"
 lilburlap#8480: Did you have to go through a redemption arc or something?
 NoelJasik#8768: I didn't spend much time here last jam
 JuliusCube#8501: im also a former world record holder for untitled magnet game speedruns though
 Mark Brown#6982: It’s all good - thanks for coming back! Good luck with your game 🙂
 birdstone#3073: wait i think i'm remembering things now
 birdstone#3073: ofc, just be proud of yourself of what you've made
 JuliusCube#8501: hi, im better now
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Timeline, Factori, Babel, Ay and Ann. I liked a bunch of them
 BadPiggy#5202: Uh oh .....
 lilburlap#8480: I haven't really made anything in a while so I'll be happy if I even submit a game
 BadPiggy#5202: Oof. Noice
 birdstone#3073: surprisingly i got in the top 100 last year and my hopes were raised
 JuliusCube#8501: although i have improved considerably from last year
 birdstone#3073: idk for me 11 people would make it extremely hard to coordinate/lead lol
 JuliusCube#8501: highly doubt im even going to make it into the top 1000 so basically theres no chance my games gonna be there
 BadPiggy#5202: Don't worry, chances are too slim that any of us will even end up there lol
 NoelJasik#8768: there's like 0.000000000000001% chance my game even flashes in the video,
 birdstone#3073: wtf
 lilburlap#8480: Oh I lost count of the years
 birdstone#3073: i think i've seen those ones
 BadPiggy#5202: Oink
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Hi Mark!
 birdstone#3073: oh no the pressure
 NoelJasik#8768: hey 
 BadPiggy#5202: My fav GMTK game was the one where you had only one tower.
Apart from that, two timin towers is pog
 NoelJasik#8768: hi mark
 JuliusCube#8501: hi mark, hopefully you dont remember me
 birdstone#3073: oh hello mark
 JuliusCube#8501: factori bc its just fun
 birdstone#3073: OOOOOO that one, i forgot if it was last year or the year before but that was a good one
 lilburlap#8480: The pogo stick one was gmtk last year right?
 birdstone#3073: what were your favourite games from last year's jam?
 lilburlap#8480: I don't think I met too many people last year I just talked aimlessly in the chats and was a little disruptive tbh
 NoelJasik#8768: yeah
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: thats fair
 PepperBoi#4544: I remember a lotta people from last year
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: and 3 dapper walrus
 birdstone#3073: ^^
 lilburlap#8480: You also have the dapper walrus pfp
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Everyone remembers me because I'm 1: always online and 2: "that person who posts all the resources and timelines and stuff"
 birdstone#3073: i remember walrus from the previous two jams
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: are you herding an entire tribe again this year for the jam?
 lilburlap#8480: I remember Walrusware and I think I remember shadow?
 birdstone#3073: this is a very welcoming community
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Hello again!
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Same to you!
 JuliusCube#8501: i also remember you from last year
 birdstone#3073: same to you, super excited to see what you create this jam
 birdstone#3073: so do i lmao
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: seems plausible 😛
 birdstone#3073: those are really cool yeah
 NoelJasik#8768:  hey i remeber you
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: there's multiple games that play with the mechanic of "do something, then do it/see it again from a different perspective" or "do something then go back and try to beat yourself" and it's one I enjoy a lot
 birdstone#3073: oh hey i remember you from last year
 birdstone#3073: oh that's sick
 NoelJasik#8768: my friend made a game 1:1 this idea
 NoelJasik#8768: yeah i remeber now
 birdstone#3073: or rather something similar to it
 birdstone#3073: i feel like i've seen that concept before
 NoelJasik#8768: previouse version of this idea got flagged by automod
 NoelJasik#8768: A idea, you have to beat the level, and after that, your actions get recorded and you need to unalive the recording of your previouse actions
 birdstone#3073: yeah these things that sort of "evolve" over time are really cool
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: But at u progress through the levels, the player gets better at the game, starts recognizing traps and stuff, gets better at the controls, etc. And there are parts of the game where you can body swap and you become the player
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: LMAO
 birdstone#3073: **good point**
 NoelJasik#8768: who said it has to be good?
 birdstone#3073: making a good "player" ai would be really challenging
for me anyway
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Fixed it. Scroll up to read loll
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: You might even be able to sed it with `s/.../...`, or that might just be slack
 snuffysam#2767: or press the 3 dots and click edit lol
 birdstone#3073: i had no idea you can do that thank you kind sir
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: If you press the up arrow, you can edit your previous message - works even with the cooldown I think
 NoelJasik#8768: bruh
 birdstone#3073: LOL smooth
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Damnit I hit enter instead of shift enter lol
 birdstone#3073: tysm for the feedback
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: I have a free idea:
A platformer where you have no checkpoints, it's procedurally generated, and you play as the enemy, and there is an ai controlled player progressing through the level that you have to try and kill
 NoelJasik#8768: just sharing some tips i picked up, but overall it's pretty solid
 birdstone#3073: absolutely
 NoelJasik#8768: We all are learning all the time
 birdstone#3073: haha yeah, i'm experimenting with a lot of genres and still mostly just learning
 NoelJasik#8768: Lol, well i made many shootem ups, and from expirance, a slow bullet never feels good, better to balance it with longer cooldown than slower bullet, if you can out run your bullets, it's pretty bad
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: *Stream
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: It is. I was going to give it another shot last year but I decided if I beat the game I wanna do it on steam to capture the moment.
 birdstone#3073: "stuck on king dice for 4 years" sounds painful
 birdstone#3073: right, i think the original idea was to have larger more damaging bullets be slower than smaller less harmful ones but i forgot about it and all of them were slow lol
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: I don't think I've even really played the game since 2018. On my main save I almost beat the game but I'm stuck on King dice, and have for 4 years lol
 NoelJasik#8768:  i feel like the player projectiles could be faster, to feel more juicy
 birdstone#3073: lol i haven't either
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: No sadly
 birdstone#3073: oh speaking of cuphead have any of you tried the new dlc?
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Nobody wants to remember that lol
 birdstone#3073: yeah that makes sense
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: I like using art and unique situations for tutorials
 NoelJasik#8768: cuphead is also pretty good
 birdstone#3073: lmfao don't remind me of my first playthough of cuphead lol
 NoelJasik#8768: i feel like that transitions it the best
 NoelJasik#8768: it's not the worst, but like i often just do controls and some easy starting combat
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: A tutorial to take some inspiration from that works really well is the Cuphead tutorial level
 birdstone#3073: fair fair
 NoelJasik#8768: i feel like the less words the better
 NoelJasik#8768: Yeah i know, but like i am fan of almost 0 text
 birdstone#3073: i thought mine was a bit more interactive? there's text but it gives you some time to play around
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Honestly I think for this year since I can't program rt not, I'd just make 2d none pixel art for anybody who wants to team. I'm usually a programmer and 2d artist but my PC is crippled
 NoelJasik#8768: it's pretty cool, though please for this jam don't do wall of text tutorial, it litterally makes me want to hit the screen
 birdstone#3073: :( i need to touch up on art lol
 birdstone#3073: wooooo tell me how you think
unfortunately i didn't get enough time to fix the slowmotion bugs
 JuliusCube#8501: that... does not look like a heart but okay
 NoelJasik#8768: i am playing it rn
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: After three submissions close and they are voted for ithink
 birdstone#3073: yeah it was like a heart and chain
 birdstone#3073: a few days after submissions close i think
 JuliusCube#8501: yeah it was the one where youre some weird creature and you link to the enemies, right? something like that at least
 unityAccount#7810: When does Mark usually do the streams in which he plays the jam games? The week after the jam or later?
 birdstone#3073: oh no lol
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: I don't even remember my game if I submitted one
 birdstone#3073: i think i heard that one but i don't think i played that either
 NoelJasik#8768: i made link to the dino
 birdstone#3073: oh you played it?
 NoelJasik#8768: i don't think i played that
 JuliusCube#8501: ah aminus was cool
 birdstone#3073: i feel like i've seen "noeljasik" before, what was yours last year?
 birdstone#3073: i made aminus
 JuliusCube#8501: i can talk about the incidents that happened on discord last jam but i decided no to because ive mentioned them 3 times already
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: mE
 NoelJasik#8768: what was your game?
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: E
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: might be bias tho
 Redline#7370: actually no
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i would've guessed 30% personally
 birdstone#3073: pog
 JuliusCube#8501: yes
 NoelJasik#8768: yes
 birdstone#3073: anyone here from the last jam?
 NoelJasik#8768: Suprisingly in a sense that it didn't match my prediction
 JuliusCube#8501: 0.4% NB also
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Surprisingly good or bad, because no matter which one I can sense some people will be offended by that comment 🥴
 NoelJasik#8768: i guess more peapole than i thought choose the opposite to the truth gender
 JuliusCube#8501: mine is 5% which isnt too odd
 NoelJasik#8768: suprisingly 18.1% female
 NoelJasik#8768: 13–17 years  -  6.5%
18–24 years  -  41.8%
25–34 years  -  20.4%
35–44 years  -  9.5%
45–54 years  -  3.3%
55–64 years  -  0.4%
65+ years  -  0.1%
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: It's Microsoft visual studio, what's weird about that lol
 snuffysam#2767: they made it
 snuffysam#2767: it's their studio
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: How
 JuliusCube#8501: idk its what its called
 Redline#7370: it's just weird that the "Microsoft" part is there
 JuliusCube#8501: whats wrong with that
 JuliusCube#8501: or outer wilds glitches
 Redline#7370:  "playing: Microsoft Visual Studio"
 JuliusCube#8501: i guess old people enjoy watching a guy wake up in a videogame, roast a marshmallow, and then jump off a bridge
 JuliusCube#8501: more 65+ than 55-64 which is odd
 JuliusCube#8501: 13–17 years  -  3.2%
18–24 years  -  44.7%
25–34 years  -  38.2%
35–44 years  -  9.9%
45–54 years  -  3.4%
55–64 years  -  0.1%
65+ years  -  0.5%
 JuliusCube#8501: lemme check mine 1 sec
 NoelJasik#8768: cocomelon real bussin ngl
 Redline#7370: also 0.2% of my viewers are female, sounds about right lol
 JuliusCube#8501: cocomelon has a lot of videos tho
 Redline#7370: yes but it's still interesting
 Jeker#3389: i was probably traumatized when i learned Mark isnt a ww2 veteran 👍  /j
 JuliusCube#8501: i guess
 NoelJasik#8768: as i said, everyone doesn't set it accurately
 Redline#7370: hmm
13-17 -> 1,1%
18-24 -> 59%
25-34 -> 36,2%
35-44 -> 3,3%
 NoelJasik#8768: do we count parents giving tablets to toddlers? cuz they only watch a limited range of videos
 IntangibleMatter#2281: New conspiracy: Mark is actually a clone that keeps getting replaced and he's genetically engineered to have such a smooth, british voice
 Jeker#3389: imagine having such a voice at age 3
 NoelJasik#8768: damn
 JuliusCube#8501: its probably closer to 10 because of how people enjoy lying about their age
 NoelJasik#8768: everyone sets 18+ lol, so it's not accurate
 IntangibleMatter#2281: That would mean the first episode of GMTK was released when he was 3. Child prodigy
 JuliusCube#8501: well maybe but i doubt it
 Redline#7370: let me check my viewer's average age
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i imagine a lot of people are, since youtube's average age is... probably 15. i'm in second year CS college
 NoelJasik#8768: maybe mark is like 10
 Jeker#3389: oh no, i spoke in a forgein language
 unityAccount#7810: You can't be sure about that either
 NoelJasik#8768: are you sure about that?
 Astral#7476: Hi, xD
 Jeker#3389: hallo
 JuliusCube#8501: only person who i know isnt in middle/high school here is mark brown so thats something
 Astral#7476: I am also starting high school next year, I actually know  irl, haha
 NoelJasik#8768: yeah prob
 JuliusCube#8501: probably lmao
 NoelJasik#8768: could be worse
 Jeker#3389: is poland really as bad as they say?
 Jeker#3389: pabloland
 NoelJasik#8768: pablo
 Jeker#3389: Pauland
 NoelJasik#8768: poland
 Jeker#3389: Oh, where are you from?
 NoelJasik#8768: we had that, but they removed it
 Jeker#3389: Yeah, we have middle school, which is between high school and elementary
 IntangibleMatter#2281: My first was early 14
 JuliusCube#8501: never said i made a discord account, and never said that I actually had an itch account back then to publish the shitty game i made back then lmao. and also i know 12 year olds dont care about the discord tos
 NoelJasik#8768: well where i live it's also starting when you are 15
 IntangibleMatter#2281: I'm Canadian and I've been in High School since I was 13
 Jeker#3389: Greece
 IntangibleMatter#2281: What country is that?
 Jeker#3389: Yeah, why?
 IntangibleMatter#2281: You're starting high school at 15?
 NoelJasik#8768: i started jams when i was late 14
 Redline#7370: 1 2 i s n o t a l l o w e d b y d i s c o r d t o s
 Jeker#3389: sadge
 JuliusCube#8501: there are 13 year olds here, and probably also 12 year olds seeing that I did my first game jam when I was 12 so unfortunately not the youngest possible
 Redline#7370: listen to me and use bloom. It could be used to cure cancer if the doctors used it well enough
 NoelJasik#8768: unfortunatly yes
 NoelJasik#8768: listen to this man, or you end up like me
 Jeker#3389: guess i am really bloody young lol
 JuliusCube#8501: crack is bad 4 u
 JuliusCube#8501: no only do math homework
 NoelJasik#8768: only do crack kids
 Redline#7370: it's a certified bruh mometntn
 NoelJasik#8768: 15? bruh moment
 Jeker#3389: why lol
 JuliusCube#8501: imagine being born in june
 Redline#7370: I don't regret anything yet since it has only been exactly one month
 NoelJasik#8768: well i give up, as my calculations are wrong
 NoelJasik#8768: i regret some stuff i did when i was 15
 JuliusCube#8501: but if you know the quadratic formula and that the range of the function is the same as the domain of its inverse you can easily figure the answer out
 NoelJasik#8768: i remeber when i was 15
 Redline#7370: 15? bruh moment
 Jeker#3389: Why? I am 15
 Redline#7370: that was a mistake mentioning that
 JuliusCube#8501: yes you can. I was the type of nerd to know this sorta stuff back then tho
 Jeker#3389: so, i can give myself the excuse of not knowing it, since i start high school next year lol
 NoelJasik#8768: it's the grade i failed at
 Jeker#3389: soooo 11th-ish?
 JuliusCube#8501: so like 10 or 11
 NoelJasik#8768: Δ = 7^2 - 4 * 2 * 5 = 9
x1 = -7-3/4 = -2.5
x2 = -7+3/4 = -1
 JuliusCube#8501: whichever grade has algebra 2
 Jeker#3389: What grade is that from?
 JuliusCube#8501: not as simple as that
 Redline#7370: *puts graph into desmos and reads values*
 Tyrix#6647: the domain and range of a function are part of its definition ... i can give example domain and range ... {1} as domain and {3/8} as domain
 JuliusCube#8501: no idea bc i have no idea what you are doing
 Vélimir#3641: yeah I guess it doesn't go into negatives
 NoelJasik#8768: am i going in the right direction in my calculations?
 JuliusCube#8501: no graph the function and youll see
 NoelJasik#8768: yeah like you can't divide by 0, so the domain can't have this [(x^2) + 2x + 5] equal to 0
 Vélimir#3641: Oh so both R
 JuliusCube#8501: range is all the numbers you can get out of the function
 Redline#7370: ah so it is what I think it is
 NoelJasik#8768: domain is all the numbers that you can use as X
 Redline#7370: my 9th grader math brain can't handle this
 Vélimir#3641: Domain is like R, and range no idea.. hyperbolic ?
 NoelJasik#8768: i can calculate the delta now
 NoelJasik#8768: [(x^2) + x + 1] / [(x^2) + 2x + 5]
 / (2x+5) = 0
(2x+5) = 0(2x+5)
2x^2 + 5x + 2x + 5 = 0
2x^2 + 7x + 5 = 0
am i going in the right direction?
 Redline#7370: isn't it the funny [x, y] thing?
 JuliusCube#8501: do you know what range is
 JuliusCube#8501: what
 Astral#7476: I think the range is x^2+x+1=y(x^2+2x+5)
 NoelJasik#8768: I don't even know the english math terms
 JuliusCube#8501: better?
 NoelJasik#8768: don't torture me
 NoelJasik#8768: dude i failed my math class
 JuliusCube#8501: daily optional math problem:
whats the domain and range of the function:
f = [(x^2) + x + 1] / [(x^2) + 2x + 5]
 Reemus#7953: I thought it is just some sort of a geometric shape of teal colour.
 Lawn#1538: Reel it in folks. You should all probably move to  if you’re going to start with the memery.
 JuliusCube#8501: ... why

 Cletus2000#0709: The jam ended, i won
 Cletus2000#0709: Thats a good one even though i dont get it
 Redline#7370: hmm what did I miss by eating dinner
 NoelJasik#8768: a meme in poland
 NoelJasik#8768: there was this song long time ago, which was a parody, it was kinda a meme, grappa ice is a very good drink though
 Cletus2000#0709: But toaster????
 MrBen#0001: I think thats ANOTHER BRICK IN THE WALL
 Cletus2000#0709: Okay cake is possible
 NoelJasik#8768: i mean i could see someone mistaking it for a cake, but toaster? seriously
 NoelJasik#8768: i made like a lot
 Cletus2000#0709: Its clearly a blue cheese (if not simply a stone)

 MrBen#0001: wait I was browsing through ur youtube
 NoelJasik#8768: If that's a toaster i am ronald makdonald
 lilburlap#8480: Alright ty I have a friend who keeps calling it a toaster
 NoelJasik#8768: I see your profile pic for the first time, i haven't been on any game dev related discords for like 6 months
 MrBen#0001: lol
 lilburlap#8480: Quick question so I can win arguments in another server: Did you recognize it as blue cheese or did you remember it from a different server?
 NoelJasik#8768: thanks for the anwser blue cheese
 lilburlap#8480: like 20 people will remember you
 NoelJasik#8768: what happens if i become a meme in general?
 Cletus2000#0709: Genius move right here

 Zoro5168#0115: Gn guys
 MrBen#0001: I went jusy for 10 secs
 JuliusCube#8501: completely understandable
 Zoro5168#0115: Agree
 MrBen#0001: omg wall of messages
 JuliusCube#8501: agree
 lilburlap#8480: I don't think they were expecting to become a cult leader when they joined the server
 JuliusCube#8501: whatever
 JuliusCube#8501: lmao i think redline just left after that
 Zoro5168#0115: With bloom
 Zoro5168#0115: I wanna see the glowy sparkly game redline makes
 Phallo#3476: haha
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Lol
 Cletus2000#0709: xd
 Cletus2000#0709: I mean, unity user, adventure time enjoyer and pixel art appreciator, i want to see your game just as bad as ben´s game
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: 😑💀😐😶🫤🥴
 lilburlap#8480: I only recently started seriously goofing off with pixel art but I will defend it with my life
 Scolon#4218: Yeah that's another thing
 Cletus2000#0709: Tbh, i hate 8bit music, but thats another thing
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: LMFAO
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Lol ok...
 JuliusCube#8501: understandable have a nice day
 Cletus2000#0709: Kinged i love you so much
 MrBen#0001: yeah thats cringe
 Redline#7370: hmm how about no
 JuliusCube#8501: redline for no specific reason im going to need your location and ip address for this bet /j
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: The only thing that annoys me more than this is when people say that pixel art is "bad graphics" that fills me with a rage capable of murder
 Scolon#4218: lol true, I don't really care what engine a game is made in. I just care that the game is good & well-made.
 Phallo#3476: game dev is not my normal forte but i made my first game 10 years ago
 Zoro5168#0115: Jk
 Caitlyn aka CSharplyn#4134: cause if u do it from time to time, you'll not be as good as someone who does it for less time all the time
 lilburlap#8480: Define "gamedev"
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Ikr
 Redline#7370: oh what are you betting?
 Cletus2000#0709: Im so sick of people promoting games with the only excuse of "done in unreal 5" bro idgaf if it looks realistic, just make it funny
 Caitlyn aka CSharplyn#4134: its not just years tho its time commitment
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: I would post amateur meme if images were allowed 😫
 Redline#7370: I'm at around 2
 JuliusCube#8501: amateur. ive done it for 4
 MrBen#0001: 3 years
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Hear no cap 🙉
 Redline#7370:  how long have you been doing gamedev let me ask that question
 MrBen#0001: then I will come to your house
 Caitlyn aka CSharplyn#4134: nice
 Zoro5168#0115: What if i say "NO"
 Redline#7370: yep
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: I'm not going to program in jam because I'm on vacation 🙉
 Cletus2000#0709: Ben youre creating too much expectation for your game xd
 JuliusCube#8501: possible in theory.
you see, seasons of rick and morty are a lot like prime numbers. They probably go on for a while, but youve got a sneaking suspicion that gaps between them are getting longer and longer.
 MrBen#0001: QUICK
 Zoro5168#0115: But i use unity cause my pc can run it
 Caitlyn aka CSharplyn#4134: does unreal have webgl
 MrBen#0001: spit that
 Cletus2000#0709: Yeah, we get it, unreal is beautiful... always the same
 SlingingPlant145#5532: unreal for the win
 Redline#7370: oh god here we go again
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: unity ftw
unity ftw
 Zoro5168#0115: Ue5 looks good
 MrBen#0001: u joking right?
 Caitlyn aka CSharplyn#4134: so dont use tasks on webgl thats multi threaded, you use coroutines etc etc
 Redline#7370: I'm gonna ignore that message and not start arguing about large build files in ue4
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: CAAAAAPPPPPPP
 Caitlyn aka CSharplyn#4134: yea webgl only has one thread so anything multi threaded on unity breaks
 MrBen#0001: no way
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: E
 Cuby#1524: thanks for the info guys!
 JuliusCube#8501: fair
 MrBen#0001: ue4 >
 Cameron#7818: But what if it turns out that Smiling Friends was just the 6th season of Rick and Morty in disguise?
 Cuby#1524: okay, thanks just read the docs, when uploading a zip the contents get extracted on itch's server and the game is just going to be embedded inside an iframe
 MrBen#0001: 🕎
 Redline#7370: I know how to do it in Unity just most of the time a lot of things break when I export to HTML5
 MrBen#0001: same here
 Caitlyn aka CSharplyn#4134: bigger barrier to entry the less people will do it
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Bro I minimized discord for 5 seconds and then my entire screen is just flooded with messages flowing in at the same time
 MrBen#0001: my pfp is smiling friends
 Caitlyn aka CSharplyn#4134: yea true i mean less people will ig
 Scolon#4218: Also web is accessible on all platforms
 JuliusCube#8501: its objectively true that that happens, so you should probably find that convert to html5 button when doing this jam for more ratings
 Redline#7370: I download them If they look like something I'd download
 MrBen#0001: go watch smiling friends
Smiling Friends > Rick and Morty
 Scolon#4218: Practice publishing web builds to itch before the game jam starts, a lot of people won't  bother downloading standalone games because they're lazy
 Caitlyn aka CSharplyn#4134: but people arent gonna download
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: RIP
 TimG#5359: thanks!
 Redline#7370: yes but observation
 lilburlap#8480: That's... a lot of the shows I watch tbh
 Caitlyn aka CSharplyn#4134: web builds look good if u try and get a job too, i know my employer saw my game jam games cause he asked about them
 Cameron#7818: According to itch, all it takes to upload an html5 game is to hand them a zip file with an index.html in it that is the entry point of the program.
 Cletus2000#0709: nope, still like 5 days left
 Redline#7370: no it starts in like 5 days
 JuliusCube#8501: says the guy who has never made a web build for the previous games theyve made lmao
 lilburlap#8480: Whoever wins needs to just add xX_ to the beginning
 TimG#5359: eh, did jam alreasy started? i missed the start?
 Cletus2000#0709: Starts goofy and childish, but man it goes deep
 Phallo#3476: Yes, it is very easy to publish js based games
 Zoro5168#0115: Anyone watched one piece?
 Redline#7370: also I'd recommend for everyone here to try to make a web build version, you will get a lot more ratings that way
 MrBen#0001: go now
 Cameron#7818: No and yes (according to their documentation, I haven't yet uploaded a test file)
 lilburlap#8480: I've heard good things about adventure time I think I'll watch it soon
 Redline#7370: in theory yes
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Yeah it's very easy, at least to me I find it a simple and comprehendible process
 MrBen#0001: adventure time >
 Cuby#1524: have you published any games yet? is it easy to implement the html/js on itch? i only made standalone applications ^^
 
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Chad2000
 MrBen#0001: LMAO imagine the nick xX_progamer_Xx winning the jam
 Phallo#3476: haha thanks 🙂
 Cletus2000#0709: same here
 Cameron#7818: My man out here ddosing everybody on the network.
 JuliusCube#8501: it probably can
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: :)
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Having xX_ Infront of your name is an instant red flag
 MrBen#0001: huge fan of adventure time
 JuliusCube#8501: yes
 MrBen#0001: I love ur pfp
 Cameron#7818: javascript.
 Zoro5168#0115: Come on its ben what can i guy named ben do/s
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Oh child of mine, you don't even realize
 Cameron#7818: Uhhh... Isn't that the broadcast address?
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: also name-based memery proooobably belongs in the hype channel
 Phallo#3476: PixiJS
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Scams are quite often. I mean it's the Internet
 Redline#7370: I agree but in this case the code can't hurt
 JuliusCube#8501: agree, you shouldnt trust stuff like this
 Zoro5168#0115: Sry
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: He's turning into a7yr old Fortnite kid help
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: gonna jump in and say that whilst Ben is probably being legitimately generous, offers like this are often a vector for scams so just keep an eye out
 Redline#7370: Epic Games allows éáőúűüöóí and others but unicode stuff nah
 JuliusCube#8501: pro tip: dont use it
 Cuby#1524: What kind of engine do you guys use for JS based games?
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: ...kk

 Redline#7370: good question. they don't
 JuliusCube#8501: not understandable
 JuliusCube#8501: why would they allow all unicode characters for usernames though
 MrBen#0001: yep
 Redline#7370: yes it is
 Zoro5168#0115: Yep exactly that
 Cletus2000#0709: And the classic 4, 3 and 0 instead of a, e and o
 MrBen#0001: more like: FŒŘŢÑÌȚƏ PŘÒ ²⁰⁰⅚
 JuliusCube#8501: xX_420_blazeit_Xx
is actually a TASer and glitchhunter for smb1 apparently
 Zoro5168#0115: Nah nowdays i mostly see em using these letters
 Cletus2000#0709: xXprogamer69xX_killergod
 JuliusCube#8501: the fact that its agglutinative is pretty cool tho
 RocketCow#5210: or at least the third that I'm present for
 Redline#7370: xX_p***y_destroyer_69_420_Xx
 Zoro5168#0115: 12 y olds usernames in fortnite be like "ĶÏÑĞ ØF WØŘŁĐ§"
 Redline#7370: yes bc they are fooken maniacs who made the language
 JuliusCube#8501: because there are like 40 hungarian conjugations for some reason
 unityAccount#7810: Too hard to moderate I guess
 MrBen#0001: u come as language
 JuliusCube#8501: yes, a math and language thread to discuss limits and also to discuss hungarian conjugations
 Cletus2000#0709: Math counts as a language?
 Redline#7370: wait isn't this ? we need a language thread
 Redline#7370: xD
 MrBen#0001: šťœp ţhįş
 Cletus2000#0709: Your mom, just in case
 Cameron#7818: Tell that to Q from Star Trek.
 Zoro5168#0115: /j

 Zoro5168#0115: Œ ğïvë mē mý föœđ
 Redline#7370: and I really hate it, and I'm better at english than that
 MrBen#0001: ăķ
 JuliusCube#8501: well yeah but they technically are letters even though they technically arent
 Cameron#7818: Yes, eth. Thank you.
 Redline#7370: also the hungarian language is like one of the hardest languages on this planet
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: eth
 Cameron#7818: Wait, not thorn...
 Zoro5168#0115: Œ ğïvë mē mý föœđ
 Cameron#7818: Yo, thorn?
 Cletus2000#0709: wow
 Scratch#4814: oh god the i
 Redline#7370: I too learn literature and those aren't letters, because they are sounds for some fucking reason
 Cameron#7818: I think dz counts as one letter in (czech?)
 StormyMay#4100: In America we have q which is functionally incapable of existing without a u next to it
 MrBen#0001: đ <---
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: so the city is properly IJmuiden, with 'both' capitalised
 JuliusCube#8501: some countries apparently
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: e.g. in dutch ij is a letter
 Zoro5168#0115: Hungry people
 MrBen#0001: ý
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: depends where you are
 JuliusCube#8501: they count apparently according to some people
 MrBen#0001: bruh who uses this
 MrBen#0001: őøöõôòóìíîïīįûůūűų
 Redline#7370: yes but those aren't technically letters
 Zoro5168#0115: B
 JuliusCube#8501: dont forget:
cs, dz, dzs, gy, ly, ny, sz, ty, zs
 Redline#7370: oh I forgor about í
 Cameron#7818: Also ß. No, it's not a B. Yes, it has no upper-case version. But actually no, it does because they made one: ẞ
 Zoro5168#0115: ó ü ö looks like a face expression sayin oh really
 Cletus2000#0709: From that, in spain we only use á é í ó ú and ü
And some regions à è ò ï
 MrBen#0001: œ
 StormyMay#4100: A
 MrBen#0001: ø
 Cameron#7818: May I offer ä ö ü
 Redline#7370: I don't get why they are on my keyboard but sure
 MrBen#0001: o like Germany
 Redline#7370: haha we have many funny letters such as: á é ő ú ű ó ü ö
 MrBen#0001: yes today
 Zoro5168#0115: Its pretty good
 MrBen#0001: hm ok
 Zoro5168#0115: Have yall ever eaten an expensive red velvet cake
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Good God
 JuliusCube#8501: old hungarian currency
 MrBen#0001: what is pengo?
 Redline#7370: ok bois I'm officially making megalovania my leitmotif for my musics, prepare your headphones
 JuliusCube#8501: 100 quintillion denomination pengő bank notes or whatever theyre called were made
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: yeah i've been meaning to get one of those 100 quintillion pengo notes
 MrBen#0001: 🔁
 Redline#7370: we used to have that like 5 billion years ago
 Cletus2000#0709: *megalurkvania becomes the world peace anthem*
 MrBen#0001: :o
 Zoro5168#0115: I beat sans in 4 hours only 1st time
 JuliusCube#8501: you heard of a pengő?
 MrBen#0001: yep
 Redline#7370: *lurks into the dictionary to change the meaning of lurking to sans undertale*
 Zoro5168#0115: Im bored
 JuliusCube#8501: *crazy* inflated
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: you sure about that?
 JuliusCube#8501: does "speedrunner" in general work
 Cameron#7818: I got that as well.
 Zoro5168#0115: Excuse to lurk
 Cletus2000#0709: *lurks breaking the 4th wall and becoming the lurk itself *
 Redline#7370: any other undertale speedrunners in here
 Cameron#7818: Have a good one
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: anyways i'm heading out. Take care everyone :D
 StormyMay#4100: Snas undertale??1???1??111
 Redline#7370: hungary moment
 Zoro5168#0115: Im dying
 Redline#7370: *menacingly continues to lurk and becomes thanos from undertale*
 JuliusCube#8501: no clue but at least its not crazy infated
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: it's not going to get confused with english forints
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: why do they call it that. nobody else uses forints
 Cameron#7818: I got to the hungarian part, didn't know what the f was.
 Zoro5168#0115: Proceeds to lurk so hard that the world turns into marvel cinematic universe
 MrBen#0001: 💀
 JuliusCube#8501: oh hungarian forint
 MrBen#0001: huf
 Redline#7370: hungarian forint
 JuliusCube#8501: HUF?
 Redline#7370: I'm still waiting for my scholarship to be given to me in euros instead of HUF
 Zoro5168#0115: Youre a cat though
 Cletus2000#0709: Hes soo cute
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Sorry being social just ain't my cup of tea (why am I here again- what am I saying. Why can't I just be a normal human)
 JuliusCube#8501: *proceeds to lurk so hard the universe fucking dies, the sun explodes, and i start a time loop*
 Cameron#7818: I propose that the euro with the stickman on the back should be the default euro for everywhere.
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: *deviously licks idea*
 Redline#7370: *proceeds to lurk so hard that the ground starts shaking*
 MrBen#0001: I hate typing on phone
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Wht :)
 Scolon#4218: lurk *menacingly*
 Reemus#7953: Euro best forever!
 Zoro5168#0115: U just added to the convo
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: *I like to lurk I got nothing to add to the convo so I lurk.*
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Rip in peace dollar 😟😫
 Redline#7370: please do that when I'm streaming on youtube thanks 😄
 Cameron#7818: *lurk lurk*
 MrBen#0001: haha
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: *lurks some more*
 Cletus2000#0709: ºoº
Ladies and gentlemen, we got it
 MrBen#0001: it got to euro
 MrBen#0001: dollar going brrrr ngl
 Zoro5168#0115: Wow so the theme is EURO for the game jam
 JuliusCube#8501: somewhere in east europe that is next to the war area
 Redline#7370: Right next to the funny things in that other country (hungary)
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: you're demonstrating _dollar_ inflation
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: California, I'm in France rt now tho
 MrBen#0001: sadly: Poland
 Cameron#7818: (And by very outdated I mean last year)
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: uh. euro inflation would mean the euro is worth _less_ relative to usd
 JuliusCube#8501: its usually 1.05-1.07
 Cletus2000#0709: Where are you all from? im spanish, btw
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: I did the maths
 MrBen#0001: oof me in poland
 Cameron#7818: Ok, my numbers are very outdated.
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: So basically 200USD
 StormyMay#4100: Nah bro inflation do go brr
 JuliusCube#8501: 1.02 is mega inflated wth
 Redline#7370: bc of things in EU that we won't talk about here
 MrBen#0001: you just need to:↙️ ↕️ 🔽 ↗️ ⬇️ ⤴️ 🔁 ↪️ ↔️ ↗️ ⬆️ ⬇️ ↖️ ↙️ ↘️ ↘️ 🔄 ♾️
 Cameron#7818: Actually, no. WHen did all this happen?
 Redline#7370: it's so inflated right now
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: it's currently almost 1:1
 Zoro5168#0115: Hungary do be hungary for money
 JuliusCube#8501: unless youre talking about gas prices the world is way past ww2 no need to worry about inflation that much
unless theres actual inflation and im just dumb
 Cameron#7818: 1USD = 0.8EUR
roughly
 StormyMay#4100: Google my friend
 Redline#7370: 1,02EUR = 1$
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: I know a Euro is more than a Dollar but by how much(I'm American)
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: guy had made some pretty good renders
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: the company claimed to manufacture space launch vehicles
 Zoro5168#0115: Ik that im a fan of his
 MrBen#0001: oof hungary
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Oh well that's not very fun.
 Cletus2000#0709: Bro, you are going through illegal paths, i dont want the government to make you dissapear
 Redline#7370: haha inflation go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
 MrBen#0001: he told it in google qna vid...
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: the way i see it this all just shows Gumption and Grit
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Mark is Mark's brother :)
 Redline#7370: it's like 250EUR /  month which is a lot tbh
 JuliusCube#8501: bro you could do anything in hungary at this point
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: i once found a us company that was illegal because the proprietor was a) 13, b) dutch, and c) had used a PO box hiring company address as company registered address
 MrBen#0001: 🆓
 Zoro5168#0115: Ive solved it mark × multiplier = Markiplier
 Redline#7370: that is a certified Hungary moment
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Business taxes 😫
 MrBen#0001: 🕎
 MrBen#0001: 🪔
 JuliusCube#8501: ^ that
 Cletus2000#0709: And his father, Mark B&W
 Redline#7370: In theory I could run a company at 15 years old it just costs money/month
 theChief#0001: Depends on the country but almost certainly not
 Cameron#7818: Highly depends on the country + state you live in, I'd guess.
 Scolon#4218: In most cases you need some parental figure/guardian
 Zoro5168#0115: MARK CYM AND MARK RBY
 Redline#7370: depends on the country but idk
 JuliusCube#8501: are you, by chance, a 13yr wanting to own a business
 MrBen#0001: we have so much in common
 StormyMay#4100: Clickbait go brrr
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Question, and this is completely hypothetical, this is just a thought, it's it legal for a 13yr old to own a business. Don't ask why
 Redline#7370: streaming is a really good idea bc I can put GMTK in the title ~~for free clickbait~~
 Zoro5168#0115: Mark RGB
 Cletus2000#0709: I think im gonna stream too
 Redline#7370: me the 15 year old with my terrible english and literally just saying what I'm coding. best streamer EU
 JuliusCube#8501: theres probably a mark black and a mark red and a mark green and a mark white somewhere as well
 StormyMay#4100: I'm gonna do a mega stream once the theme is announced while I work on art if my team is chill with it so I'm excited
 MrBen#0001: feeding with ideas
 MrBen#0001:
 Zoro5168#0115: So i wont ask that
 JuliusCube#8501: on one of the jams i used to listen to redlines streams as a podcast
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Mark**s**?
 Redline#7370: it's just that seeing other people's progress is one of the coolest things is jams
 Zoro5168#0115: Gameplay isnt something i can classify into different types as easily as music camera and art cuz it depends on the theme mostly
 Redline#7370: oh nvm then that's cool
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Yay
 Lawn#1538: One of the channels for sharing images will open up when the jam starts.
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: we do have a progress pics channel - presumably with longer slowmode (and locked until the jam is actually a thing)
 MrBen#0001: 😋
 JuliusCube#8501: narcisist
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Ong
 Cletus2000#0709: Im doing a mmorpg
 MrBen#0001: oh no my cloak got disguised
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: I remember that
 Redline#7370: hmm that makes sense but this way it's really hard to show progress other than streaming I think, but sacrifices must be made
 StormyMay#4100: I can imagine how the vcs ended lmao
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: That sounds like ear pain
 JuliusCube#8501: who thought that was a good idea
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Rip
 MrBen#0001: ben thread >
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: one year we had public voice chats. _mistake_
 Scolon#4218: Guys be careful of shouting your game ideas in chat btw
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: during the jam the server has far more active participants than usual, we just want to keep it as easy to moderate as possible
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Math thread yes thread
 Zoro5168#0115: Its like hes laying on the ground screaming noooo
 MrBen#0001: yeah i mostly sleep and ocasionally do work
 JuliusCube#8501: math thread best thread
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Gameplay
 Cletus2000#0709: Ben begging for his happy blueprints life
 unityAccount#7810: You can always avoid it
 Cameron#7818: I am for math thread
 StormyMay#4100: What if we argued over color labels
 Zoro5168#0115: Your pfp makes sense now
 MrBen#0001: noo
 Zoro5168#0115: Maths thread wooooooooo
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Maths Thread :)
 Cameron#7818: I am also stupid if you couldn't tell. 🙃
 JuliusCube#8501: agree
 Scolon#4218: How many people are submitting a game
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Yes
 Lawn#1538: We probably need a math thread at this point…
 MrBen#0001: lmao
 Redline#7370: also is there a reason why we can't send files/screenshots in these chat rooms, or just safety reasons?
 Zoro5168#0115: Hmm music done art done camera done what next should i ask
 Cameron#7818: Wait, strawberry.
 JuliusCube#8501: what
 MrBen#0001: NOOO NOT MATHS
 Cameron#7818: I like marmalade game jam.
 Scolon#4218: Yes
 Redline#7370: hmm yes good idea
 Lawn#1538: Let’s steer this ship back to game jam chat
 MrBen#0001: same :#
 Zoro5168#0115: Did it
 JuliusCube#8501: agree but its funny to think about lmao
 Cameron#7818: I just lost the game and so have all of you now.
 MrBen#0001: sure
 JuliusCube#8501: do it if you want
 JuliusCube#8501: nah its fine
 Redline#7370: I agree
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: I know it's a joke, but, uhhh, let's not do that 👀
 JuliusCube#8501: the ping incident was when i pinged him 47 times in 2 days, he said that if i dont win the game jam nobody would take that record away from me
 Redline#7370: everyone quickly ping  and delete the message to create a ghost ping
 Cletus2000#0709: 😎
 Scolon#4218: also congrats on 80 subscribers
 Zoro5168#0115: Congrats u a gigachad
 Cletus2000#0709: . last luigi said
 Zoro5168#0115: Go scroll up if ure a gigachad
 Scolon#4218: He probably forgot about it a long time ago
 Zoro5168#0115: He told that story a few hours ago
 Scolon#4218: Stop thinking about the luigi incident bro
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: ? Now I'm intrigued
 Redline#7370: nvm
 MrBen#0001: ?
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Who hath @ me
 JuliusCube#8501: hopefully mark doesnt still think of me as a creep after the luigi incident and the ping incident of last year
 Cameron#7818: But it's not from this server...
 Redline#7370: this is the kekw of this server
 Scolon#4218: 🔗
 Cameron#7818: 
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: we commissioned them in batches
 MrBen#0001: yep
 Zoro5168#0115: Cute link holding a gun
 Zoro5168#0115: Lol
 JuliusCube#8501: lmao
 JuliusCube#8501: its like a triple
 Zoro5168#0115: Thats more like a double
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: it's not somehow inherent to binary or to computing
 Jeker#3389: hey, so many zeroes, were there for demonstration, i know theres a limit
 Cameron#7818: And it's even better to just bitshift one to the left. (only applies to ints though)
Or the right, can't remember
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: almost all decimal representations lose that level of accuracy too
 MrBen#0001: lmao the 'knowlege'
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: and there have been computers which are _native_ bcd
 theChief#0001: 7 significant figures for a float 😂 or most implementations of it lol
 Cameron#7818: We could accurately represent that in just 0s and 1s. Such systems exist. But floating point numbers isn't that.
And floats aren't really fractions, they're a number and then an exponent. 
 Cletus2000#0709: I mean, who doesnt?
 JuliusCube#8501: way less zeroes, but yes, floating point errors exist
 Redline#7370: I'm pretty sure they don't have that many zeroes
 Jeker#3389: Bit shifts go brrrrrrr
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Yeah, I get you...  It's still better to multiply by 0.5 than to divide by 2
 Jeker#3389: like, computers convert 3.00000000000000000000000000000000 to 3.00000000000000000000000000000004
 Zoro5168#0115: Nah that man has wisdom of all that exists
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: but you bank doesn't have to account for you getting 1/3 cents in your paycheck
 RocketCow#5210: This is also why you never *never* *NEVER* use floats in financial processing.
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: for bcd it's the same as numbers that are messy with standard decimal notation anyway, like 1/3
 JuliusCube#8501: so youre like half modeling ignorant and half math ignorant then?
 Cletus2000#0709: Me too, but 🤫
 Jeker#3389: 0.5, yeah, they mess it up on reallyyyyy specific numbers
 Redline#7370: I'm doing everything solo lol
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: though binary coded decimal can represent exactly 0.5, if you really need to
 Jeker#3389: they are represented in fractions, thats why computers mess it up, as they cant accuratley express that, using only 1s and 0s
 Cletus2000#0709: Nah
 Zoro5168#0115: Im back,back pain
 Cameron#7818: TL;DR of the computer magic:
A float of 0.5 doesn't represent 0.5, it represents all the numbers that are really close to 0.5 .
 Cletus2000#0709: Not dumb, just math ignorant, but we are all modelling ignorant compared to you, thats why gamedev is usually a team thing
 Zoro5168#0115: No worries if u make good games even without this knowlege
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Is this server full of dad jokes??
 Jeker#3389: No one?
 StormyMay#4100: Hi front, I'm side

```
 Jeker#3389: yeah, that pretty much
 JuliusCube#8501: yep
 Cameron#7818: That's because floats aren't actually decimal numbers. They're the idea of decimal numbers, wrapped in a layer of computer magic™️. Despite that, people still think they're supposed to be decimal numbers.
 StormyMay#4100: I understand some of those words
 Jeker#3389: have you guys seen fast inverse square root? thats cool
 Triggered#6897: I can find it but there was a talk where speaker duscussed how a function(dont remember which one) could be used to calculate pow() in ans. Is approx but ut works
 JuliusCube#8501: so what are we going to compare end results later

 ArcadeEngineer#5120: i just mean for cpu code rather than gpu
 RocketCow#5210: The challenge has been presented. It is time for a CODE OFF
 Jeker#3389: Nope, not just a python thing, computers in general mess up floating points
 RedTeapot#1960: Good if you don't need it but understanding math can expand your possibilities. For example, TIL about some procedural animation shenanigans
 Cameron#7818: What is a cpu library?
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: i dunno if similar exists as a cpu library
 Redline#7370: that's a challenge
 Cameron#7818: TL;DR:
Pythagoras is responsible for Fortnite.
 StormyMay#4100: Math jokes my god
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: i don't know if you can access this in higher-level APIs but in cuda there's a hardware-accelerated approximation of square root available based on quadratic interpolation
 Jeker#3389: Python actually makes sense sometimes
 RocketCow#5210: so would python
 JuliusCube#8501: that explains why
 Roiboi#2055: pythagoras
 MrBen#0001: bruh stop. I feel like in school
 JuliusCube#8501: do you do coding at all
 Redline#7370: yes
 Jeker#3389: **JavaScript would like to have a conversation with you**
 Cameron#7818: But if you just want to know if ? is greater than 5, you don't need to do the square root of a²+b², you can just compare against 25 (5²) instead and that's less math.
Also, this assumes you know what a and b are already, which on a computer, generally you do. 
 unityAccount#7810: Error: Can't apply operand '+' between 'char' and 'int' types
 theChief#0001: It's not like, super necessary - but brushing up on vector maths and trigonometry is suuuuper useful for games ☺️
 Jeker#3389: i liked that, good job
 JuliusCube#8501: 3.99999...
 Cletus2000#0709: Fantastic Ralph
 MrBen#0001: u ashamed me
 Jeker#3389: ok that was funny
 RedTeapot#1960: More like string concatenation
 RocketCow#5210: you can think of it like vector graphics in 3d. The resolution is calculated as needed, instead of being baked into the data.
 Redline#7370: greater than 0
 MrBen#0001: ??
 Triggered#6897: 22 #alternativemath
 Redline#7370: 21.

 RedTeapot#1960: 10
 Cletus2000#0709: Well yeah, but explained to begginers, you could make infinite zoom in a sphere and not see any hard edge xd
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Fine, I'll give you something simple... What's 2+2?
 Redline#7370: hmm yes
 MrBen#0001: lol
 MrBen#0001: yep same here
 Astral#7476: I dont know what they are talking about either, if it makes you feel better xD
 StormyMay#4100: Bro I'm an artist all this coding talk is making my head spin
 Cameron#7818: Yes.
 MrBen#0001: I feel dumb when idk what u all talking about
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: without the z in 2D, which is why it's simpler
 RedTeapot#1960: There is a difference between how it's represented and how it's rendered. Vector graphics is a thing as well, you know
 Cletus2000#0709: Oh shit, i feel so dumb
 Cameron#7818: That'll give you the distance squared, I think but if you're just comparing against a constant, it should work.
 Cameron#7818: x * x + y * y + z * z
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: No, there are only so much polygons that a graphics card can render, even the top of the line cards...
 MrBen#0001: me: using blueprint
 JuliusCube#8501: i second this, square magnitude
 JuliusCube#8501: imagine not spamming bloom and volumetric fog
 theChief#0001: Use the squared version and compare it with the squared value!
`.sqrMagnitude > radius*radius`
 Redline#7370: just don't use a square root xd and use the squared number instead
 Cameron#7818: It does, yes. It's always useful for any programmer to have some basic knowledge about the layer just below the one they're working on. Especially when it comes to optimization.
 Cletus2000#0709: Do you know any better way to get distances?
 Redline#7370: My games usually have a GPU bottleneck and not a CPU one lmao (Whomst)
 JuliusCube#8501: probably
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: coming form a guy who sucks at math
 MrBen#0001: um
 Triggered#6897: Is there another way to calculate distance other then pythagorean?
 RocketCow#5210: It's the same for understanding data structures. You'll just naturally write better code the more things you understand, at least on a basic level.
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Trust me when I say this, math is used in a lot of things, and the good news is that it's really simple
 theChief#0001: Yeah 😂 but that optimisation might make your game a stable 60fps rather than dipping all over the place xD
 JuliusCube#8501: can i have a full list of the stuff i want to avoid?
 Redline#7370: only when you start optimizing your code 😎
 theChief#0001: Helps to know what things are doing - for example, Vector3.Distance uses a square root, and generally you want to avoid sqrt where possible
 Redline#7370: It probably has somewhere but I was like: hmm let's give it a nerdy math name since the entire game is just math
 RocketCow#5210: it also helps to have a basic understanding of the functions the engine does for you, otherwise you're wasting time and patience with trial and error.
 MrBen#0001: never encourted it once beside the onetime when making terrain gen
 Cameron#7818: I mean, yea. But similar amounts of math are present just in this chat, right now.
That doesn't mean we need to know the math that's going on to make this work.
 JuliusCube#8501: well yeah thats probably where you got the name square cosine from because your game has no squared cosines
 Redline#7370: Vectors are cool 👍
 snuffysam#2767: Knowing how to change something’s velocity correctly
 Zoro5168#0115: Thanks all of u
 Cletus2000#0709: Nurbs modelling is modelling but with mathematical functions, so infinite poly count, infinite resolution
 Triggered#6897: I know I should stop with useful math links but this one was really helpfull to me so do check this out also thanks again theChief#0001
 snuffysam#2767: Vector math especially is used a lot in game dev
 Redline#7370: yeah but for square cosine it was mostly just random math function spam until something nice shows and that's the game lol
 RocketCow#5210: 4 years in blender and never heard of NURBS? Talk about staying in your lane.
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: It's used there too, for physics, polly count, particle emitters, geometry (since that is math)... There is a lot of math in game dev, even if the program is doing it for you...
 MrBen#0001: wat?
 Cletus2000#0709: Try NURBS modelling
 RocketCow#5210: Making materials on the other hand, that requires math.
 Scolon#4218: Unless you're building a modeling software
 Cameron#7818: Modelling is almost math free indeed.
 JuliusCube#8501: youve used sines and other stuff in shaders before redline
 Cletus2000#0709: Modelling is not the same as programming logic
 unityAccount#7810: It's very useful in programming
 Scolon#4218: Trigonometry is very useful in action-packed games ye
 Redline#7370: hmm yes
 JuliusCube#8501: for me its basically vectors and it ends there for math in games
 RocketCow#5210: no no no, I mean stuff like Grand Strategy or 4x. Developing those is 99% spreadsheets and statistics. Ain't no engine do that for you.
 Cameron#7818: Depends on the kinds of games and the environment but a decent understanding of some trigonometry and (in 3D) vectors is pretty useful across the board.
 RocketCow#5210: Depends entirely on what game you're making. Some games you can get away with not knowing anything, other games are *oops, all maths*.
 MrBen#0001: i understand it for some advanced making systems from scratch but for 3d and gane dev?
 JuliusCube#8501: agree but it cool
 Cletus2000#0709: Freya holmer is god tier
 MrBen#0001: bruh math is not that important in gamedev
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: You need it to program
 Cameron#7818: numbers go brrrr
 JuliusCube#8501: math is fun
Maths related to 3d stuff
 Cameron#7818: Also, I can't vouch for its efectiveness but it has helped me once in the past: mathsisfun.com
 RocketCow#5210: Freya Holmer is great. I'm not a big math nerd and I've learned quite a lot from her videos.
 unityAccount#7810: Numberphile is the best if you want really big maths simplified by some cool mathematicians
 Lawn#1538: And plenty of math videos too.
 Lawn#1538: There’s a course on video game math via GameDev.tv if game math is all you’re interested in. It’s like $1 on humble bundle. I haven’t taken the course personally but could be decent.
Freya Holmer has some great videos on shaders via YouTube.
 JuliusCube#8501: agree but those are also physics and general science
 PepperBoi#4544: Veritasium also has some good math videos
 JuliusCube#8501: well yeah obviously but you could always get started by looking up things on the internet
 Lawn#1538: It depends what kind of math and how deep you want to go
 JuliusCube#8501: some youtube channels you could look into are 3blue1brown, stand-up maths, mathologer, and numberphile
 Vélimir#3641: ^ the calculator is seriously incredible, I've been using it since march and multiple times it made my life so much easier
 unityAccount#7810: Books (maybe you tube, brilliant etc. but books are definitely the best)
 Cameron#7818: Various places. One that comes to mind that's really good for a bunch of concepts is 3Blue1Brown on youtube.
 Cameron#7818: Ye. And math Wikipedia can be entertaining to look through. (sometimes just for the sheer ridiculousness)
 Zoro5168#0115: Hey where can i learn math from
 JuliusCube#8501: yeah theres also hyperbolic trig which are analogues to the trig functions but aren't the same thing
tbh they shouldnt count as regular trig functions
 JuliusCube#8501: yes that makes sense, but still i go google what something is and i go on a 5 hour spree of looking at random wikipedia articles
 Vélimir#3641: there's cosh, sinh and tanh, iirc
 Cameron#7818: Ye.
 JuliusCube#8501: because csc, sec, and cot are the reciprocals of sin, cos, and tan respectively
 Cameron#7818: It has all the info in a very structured form.
But if you're not fluent in algebra and set theory you won't be able to read most of it.
 JuliusCube#8501: sin cos and tan are what are used tho usually
 JuliusCube#8501: well theres sin, cos, tan, cot, sec, csc, and thats about it
 unityAccount#7810: Wikipedia is notorious for being hard to understand when it comes to math
 JuliusCube#8501: like my brain randomly evolved the idea of limits while looking at the graph of x/x
 Cameron#7818: Honestly, Wikipedia can be terrible for math.
 Cameron#7818: And there's only three main trig functions.
The other three are just those but the other way round. 
 JuliusCube#8501: tbh actually most of my math knowledge doesnt come from wikipedia, it comes from messing around with desmos
 JuliusCube#8501: agree with that
 unityAccount#7810: Yep, trigonometry is pretty powerful even in game dev
 RedTeapot#1960: And sometimes you want a shortcut for some expression
 Cameron#7818: The same reason there's so much math in general: Numbers can do a lot of things.
 JuliusCube#8501: limits and derivatives are cool but trigonometry will always hurt me
 JuliusCube#8501: but even though i know some calculus, i still *dont understand why there are so many trigonometric functions*
well its not too much and theyre not difficult to memorize but still
 Cameron#7818: nice!
 Zoro5168#0115: I wanted to use it buts too heavy for my pc so i opted for unity
 JuliusCube#8501: well thats cool i guess
im not at the point in school where I learn calculus and i already know it which is pretty cool
 parks19#1135: lol
 Chimplement#7074: no mini jam
 Zoro5168#0115: It looked so nice in the trailers that i became a game dev literally
 Zoro5168#0115: U explained stuff with more stuff i
Dont know but it did clear some thing so thanks
 Cameron#7818: If you know a thing and you didn't go to school* for it: You're self taught.
 parks19#1135: thoughts on unreal engine 5
 Chimplement#7074: im back from doing a little work on a jam game
 JuliusCube#8501: good
 unityAccount#7810: Physics gets cooler at high school (at least in my country)
 Cameron#7818: They do.
 JuliusCube#8501: well if wikipedia and mathologer videos count as self-taught
 JuliusCube#8501: for me at least
ive literally never had any formal training. Im all self-taught for the most part
 Cameron#7818: It is.
 JuliusCube#8501: listen its difficult to explain
 Cortex#6011: oh so 9.999... + lim (x -> infinity) {1/10x} = 10; that makes more sense
 Cameron#7818: That's not short. 🙃
 JuliusCube#8501: take a function, any function, lets say f(x) = 5x+1
now you know how normally when you put a number into the function you get the value of the function at that point. But what if, instead of getting the value, you got the slope of the function at that point? what would this modified function look like?
well, if you know what slope intercept form is, you could probably figure out that the slope of the function is always 5.
this modified function is called the derivative of that function.
Now lets say, instead of finding the slope at a specific point, you find the area under the function from 2 different points.
this is called an integral.
These 2 ideas, along with limits, are the core of calculus. and calculus in a sense is the study of these 2 ideas.
idk if that makes sense
 Zoro5168#0115: Ive learnt about displacement velocity and acceleration and the 3 laws of motion next thing is gonna be gravity
 Cameron#7818: Yea, definitely.
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: True, luckily I got time, hoping I can just vibe around here and playtest games if people need it. but for the cheating prevention I think it's a great system.
 Zoro5168#0115: Thats cool
 Cameron#7818: numbers go brrrr
 unityAccount#7810: With calculus you can calculate rates of change (practical example: velocity is rate of change of displacement, acceleration is rate of change of velocity), calculate surfaces/volumes of curved shapes/bodies etc.
 Cameron#7818: Yea. Though I'm curious how many games it'll be this year. Since last year some people complained about it being too many for them go through cause they didn't have much time and had some specific games they heard about and wanted to play and rate.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: talking abt limits
 Zoro5168#0115: Shader programmers be like
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: 0/infinity is infinity iirc, and infinity - infinity is undetermined, because you need to establish which infinity is like. "bigger"
 Zoro5168#0115: I t only ends after an infinite no. Of zeroes which technically means it never ends
 Zoro5168#0115: So 10 +0=10
 RocketCow#5210: That works, thanks!
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: THat's tbh an amazing system!
 JuliusCube#8501: it does bc 9.999... = 10 and 0.000...1 = 0
 Zoro5168#0115: It can becayse 9.9... is = 10
 Cameron#7818: Last year there wasn't directly but you could just go to the page of all submitted games, sort by random and take the first one.
 Scolon#4218: iirc there's systems in place that can invalidate rates on a game too
 Cortex#6011: wait 9.999... goes on forever; 0.000...1 implies that the decimal ends, and therefore is not infinite, so 9.9999... + 0.000...1 can't equal 10; is that right?
 Cameron#7818: If it's like last year, you'll need to rate X random games before you get to choose which ones to rate.
This is to prevent people from getting all their friends / social media followers, whatever... to just come in and give their game a perfect score.
 RocketCow#5210: is there a way to access the random queue if you've submitted? I would assume so, but just making sure.
 Zoro5168#0115: Can you explain what calculus is about in short
 Scolon#4218: I'll probably do a mix of random games and just playing peoples' games that I see are actively participating
 Redline#7370: hmm
 JuliusCube#8501: i feel like half the people in this server are just bored highschoolers
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Alright, getting random games to vote on doesn't seem that bad.
 unityAccount#7810: What does *until* mean? Will those rights unlock later?
 Cameron#7818: On the note of playing/rating games, quoting from the jam page:
```
Everyone is eligible to rate games - and will be able to find them on the itch.io page for the jam, after it ends.
Those who submitted or contributed to a game will be able to judge whichever games they like. Others will have to vote on games provided at random, until they unlock full rating privileges. ```
 Zoro5168#0115: That is the question
 JuliusCube#8501: you could probably learn the basics of calculus right now if youre in 9th grade
 Zoro5168#0115: To be or not to be
 Redline#7370: or was I guess
 Redline#7370: I'm too a 9th grader
 Zoro5168#0115: Ik
 JuliusCube#8501: i feel like were destroying this conversation with random math talk rn
 Zoro5168#0115: Oh ok
 JuliusCube#8501: basically make x go closer and closer to 0 from the positive direction, what do you get?
its pretty simple
 Zoro5168#0115: But i still want to learn about it
 JuliusCube#8501: therere things called poles and zeroes which are used in complex analysis and they extend this idea
 Cameron#7818: Probably not. But if it's anything like last year, there may be some system that prevents you from rating just any game.
 Zoro5168#0115: Nah i aint know any limits im in like 9th grade
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: No I don't think so, would be kinda... weird if it was. wouldn't it? (or is that just me)
 unityAccount#7810: Do you have to upload a game in order to play others' games?
 JuliusCube#8501: take the limit of 1/x * x where x -> 0+
1/x goes to infinity, x goes to 0, when you multiply them they go to 1. yes it can be
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I'm overexcited for this :3
 Redline#7370: and that time doesn't even contain commenting!
 Zoro5168#0115: Wait it can be other than infinity or 0?
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: True true I did not think of it that way.
 Cameron#7818: Last year, if you did that, spending 5 minutes on each game, with no sleep, it would have taken you 20 days of non-stop playing games.
Remember: No sleep, no food, no showers, no breaks. Only games.
For 20 days.
 Redline#7370: it's not healthy tbh, from experience playing through 24 games and rating them takes like 2 hours
 unityAccount#7810: Yes and no. After all, the one with 2x has a larger perimeter, so must have more points. But when you dive into how infinity works, I think they both have aleph-0 points.
 Zoro5168#0115: Yeah i messed up in the simplification
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: why no more?
 JuliusCube#8501: but 0x is indeterminant. aka it could be 0, it could be infinity, it could be another number if you wanted it to.
 Redline#7370: play like 50 games at most, but not more
 Redline#7370: don't try that
 Scolon#4218: I will try to play every game, though I know that's not possible
 JuliusCube#8501: [sqrt(a+b)+sqrt(a-b)]^2/2b
all you needed to do was to multiply numerator and denominator by +sqrt(a-b)) and youd get a difference of squares at the bottom. Then you could just simplify
im sure I can simplify more than what I did here but i think this is enough
 Zoro5168#0115: X= infinity 2x is also=infinity
 Cameron#7818: Heresy, I know.
 snuffysam#2767: yes, patrons can post images
 Zoro5168#0115: Same theyre the same
 Scolon#4218: Oh ok thanks, couldn't find that
 Redline#7370: wait a second... an image?????? impossible
 Zoro5168#0115: But just proved with the 10 and 9 statement that any number with infinete zeroes between its decimals =0
 unityAccount#7810: I have got another one: which circle has got more points, a circle with a radius x or a circle with a radius 2x?
 Scolon#4218: How long is the rating period again
 Wokarol#0940: 0 hour jam is also a thing
 JuliusCube#8501: infinity is wonky
it can also get infinitely many zeroes to equal a nonzero number
 Zoro5168#0115: Thank u i came up with that on my own in 9th grade
 JuliusCube#8501: yes
 Jeker#3389: Τry making a text editor, in C++
 unityAccount#7810: It will be infinitesimal
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: *vibes*
 unityAccount#7810:   
 Zoro5168#0115: So if i cut a square with area 1 in half infinitely its area will eventually reach the value 0.000....1 so its area will =0?
 Cameron#7818: Same here.
 Scolon#4218: It's too easy for me to get way too excited
 Jeker#3389: yes, pretty much me lol
 Cameron#7818: Step 1: Get it barely working
Step 2: Overexcitement and a bunch of messing around with it because it works now and that's very cool and it's nice and whoops, you've wasted half an hour.
 JuliusCube#8501: yes that is correct in a sense
 unityAccount#7810: Yes
 Zoro5168#0115: Tell me if im right but 10-9.999...=0.000......1 but we also know that 9.9999...= 10 and 10-10=0 so is 0.000....1=0
 Scolon#4218: If you sleep & eat like you're supposed to the max you can dev is like 32 hours anyways
But account for bathroom breaks, other crap, ~~and procrastinating~~
You probably won't get anywhere near that
 Jeker#3389: am i the only one, that when something works, they run it over and over again?
 Cameron#7818: Yes, sleep.
Get sleep.
You have 48 hours, at least 8 of those are for sleep.
AT LEAST
 RedTeapot#1960: Trijam is a thing too
 Wokarol#0940: more than 3 hours, worth a try
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: oh yeah I have to sleep twice inbetween working
 Scolon#4218: You'd be surprised how many people don't use the entire timeframe
 Cameron#7818: Even if you make the worst game known to man, the only thing you've lost is a single day.
So yes, it is worth trying.
 RedTeapot#1960: Kek. Game jammers in your area
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: you may not rest, there are game jammers nearby.
 Zoro5168#0115: Yes
 JuliusCube#8501: and what am i supposed to do with this? rationalize?
 Wokarol#0940: Fine, procrastinating and playing Outer Wilds
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: baas
 Jeker#3389: ^ (Not really for Software Development tho, but yes, really important for game programming)
 RedTeapot#1960: I should go to sleep but I'm stuck in this chat lol
 Scolon#4218: I can confirm we are all indeed alive
 Zoro5168#0115: Bad
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: life is going slightly better. Wbu?
 BadPiggy#5202: ***oinks***
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: *lurks*
 Wokarol#0940: Hello you all, how's life?
 RedTeapot#1960: Now I'm kinda glad that I went for a mathematics degree
 Jeker#3389: MicroWorlds is so weird lol, its Lua, in Greek
 Zoro5168#0115: The only real engine is the toyota JZ engine
 Scolon#4218: Just build a game in microsoft word then
 BadPiggy#5202: Vector math is pretty much the only math I do in games lol
My computer is too much of a potato to try shaders
 Jeker#3389: Yes, but microworlds.
 Jeker#3389: Thats not what I am saying, I am saying hate all of them lol
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: The only real engine is Scratch.
 Scolon#4218: omg guys all engines except the one I use are bad!!!!
 Jeker#3389: Best way to not get called out for hating an engine: Hate all of them (jk)
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: modular algebra too if you want to get fancy
 RedTeapot#1960: Oh, and randomization stuff, yeah
 Zoro5168#0115: Rationalize this
 unityAccount#7810: Hmm, haven't got into shader programming yet. ||I just use Unity's graphs🏃‍♂️||
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: physics is applied mathematics
 theChief#0001: Maths is SUPER important for game programming
 Scolon#4218: If you want to do anything cool with rendering/animations you need a lot of math yeah
 RedTeapot#1960: You might want some trigonometry for the shaders as well as interpolation and derivatives stuff for e.g. procedural animations
 Zoro5168#0115: Just rationalize it for me will ya
 Yollie#2239: This
 Scolon#4218: Crazy math is usually with shader programming
 Zoro5168#0115: I frogor💀
 unityAccount#7810: The rest is logics and physics
 Jeker#3389: i've been playing the bloody game for 4 months now, and i still havent won a single game lol
 unityAccount#7810: From what I've seen, games don't have any crazy math involved. Vector math might be the hardest it gets
 Jeker#3389: oh boy, time to get my ass kicked in territorial.io
 Redline#7370: hello
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: hello
 Zoro5168#0115: Uh wait
 Redline#7370: equals what?
 Redline#7370: triangle do be sus tho
 Zoro5168#0115: [Sqrt(a+b) + sqrt(a-b)]/[sqrt(a+b) - sqrt(a-b)]
 Yollie#2239: 39 buried
0 found
 Lawn#1538: 🥁
 JuliusCube#8501: ur pointless
 Lawn#1538: What did the triangle say to the circle?
 JuliusCube#8501: ofc im a nerd
 Yollie#2239: OH REALLY? I’ll send you the hardest question in my maths homework and I’ll see if you can solve it
 JuliusCube#8501: im also a part of the math thread on the brackeys server lmao
 Zoro5168#0115: Thats exponential i didnt know that
 Yollie#2239: Some stranger idk
 JuliusCube#8501: i can see that, i am a big math nerd after all
for example, give me a math question and ill answer it
 Zoro5168#0115: Existential crisis
 Redline#7370: the neighbour's^n kid
 Yollie#2239: Nah just some random nerd I guess
 Chimplement#7074: i should be working on another game jam submision but i am to busy reading chat
 Zoro5168#0115: Who am i then
 Redline#7370: the neighbour's neighbour's kid
 Redline#7370: nice name lmao
 JuliusCube#8501: who am i then
the other neighbors kid?
 Yollie#2239: Redline is 100% the neighbours kid
 Zoro5168#0115: Nice
 Yollie#2239: Yeah exactly
 Redline#7370: **no.**
 Yollie#2239: Because it’s going to be my ranking
 JuliusCube#8501: yes he seems like the neighbors kid when you think of the dragon's tail
 Redline#7370: hmm sus
 Yollie#2239: Yeah I can agree with that
 Zoro5168#0115: Why d u change ur name
 Yollie#2239: Ah
 JuliusCube#8501: i literally said rarely tries to use that intelligence
 Redline#7370: well graphics was second I think
 Yollie#2239: Redline is the neighbour’s kid
 Zoro5168#0115: Bloom is all u need
 Chimplement#7074: so the rest was worse?
 Yollie#2239: Really smart? You gone mad?
 Redline#7370: I made Whomst not knowing music or sound design, and my sound score was the highest lmao
 hierr777#8659: ok
 Zoro5168#0115: Its a joke ure here
 hierr777#8659: what
 JuliusCube#8501: imo redline kinda feels like that one friend who is really smart but spends all his time doing random stuff  and rarely tries using that intelligence but idk
im not smart so i wouldnt know
 Zoro5168#0115: Hey ure hierr
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: yoink
 Redline#7370: *sfxr and royaltyfreeplanet*
 hierr777#8659: PLEASE JOIN OUR TEAM'
 Zoro5168#0115: Sound
 Yollie#2239: Get a *musician*
 Redline#7370: you don't need more
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: check out the team finder
 Zoro5168#0115: http://teamfinder.gmtkgamejam.com/
 Chimplement#7074: yeah probably wont eather
 HG-007#3871: I would like to participate
I know programming
can do artwork
 Yollie#2239: Like redline feels like that weird cousin
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: weird… distant family
 harper#8662: wait brackeys still hosts game jams?
 Yollie#2239: Yes you guys are like really weird family
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: godot seems great after watching my jam partner go absolutely wild in it
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: good to know, i'll have to add them to possible jams to join
 harper#8662: damn i forgot about brackeys
 Chimplement#7074: nah i used godot
 Redline#7370: n o
 JuliusCube#8501: funny how you call it a outer wilds platformer but okay
it is a good game that i may or may not have stolen ~~many~~ a couple ideas from
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: don’t think so
 Yollie#2239: Nope
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: are brackeys game jams usually unity only?
 Chimplement#7074: hey i am more than that
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: it is like a reunion!
 Yollie#2239: The one with the particles was a cool puzzle game
The outer wilds platformer had a weird story but was pretty cool
 Chimplement#7074: brackeys jam reunion
 Redline#7370: brackeys gamejam people
 JuliusCube#8501: both
 Redline#7370: I'm pretty sure I playtested that, and it was very nice
 Zoro5168#0115: Who are all of u man im totally new to the indie game community
 Yollie#2239: Which one? The one with the particles or the outer wilds platformer?
 JuliusCube#8501: yeah and the other one where i tried making a metroidbrainia
 Redline#7370: the golfy explody one?
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: what game was that again?
 JuliusCube#8501: speaking of brackeys jam games, what did   you guys think of my game
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: LMAO
 snuffysam#2767: me making a video game about algae disasters
 Chimplement#7074: cool
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: fair enough, I’m still not halfway done with Lori
 Redline#7370: me when Whomst
 Yollie#2239: Relatable
 JuliusCube#8501: the bloom is made out of the tears of my enemies that think bloom has no place in videogames
 Chimplement#7074: no made one update with more levels than stopped because of an overdose of spaghetti
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: are you also still working on the brackeys game?
 Redline#7370: hmm yes, the bloom is made out of bloom. veyr intreresting
 Yollie#2239: Exactly but with enough propaganda anything is possible
 Chimplement#7074: hey i recognise you
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: the godot brigade begins
 Redline#7370: bloom, bloom everywhere
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: ayyy hello chimplement
 Chimplement#7074: hmm thats a dangourous path to walk
 Zoro5168#0115: Bloom,lots of Bloom.
 Chimplement#7074: sort of yeah
 JuliusCube#8501: ooh you turned deceitful drone into a full game? cool
 Yollie#2239: Just say you want to join the bloom cult
 Yollie#2239: Yes exactly
 Chimplement#7074: how does one join this cult?
 lilburlap#8480: Yeah the difference may seem small but in practice the 2 things are barely recognizable /j
 Zoro5168#0115: More like far enough
 Redline#7370: well close enough
 Zoro5168#0115: True
 lilburlap#8480: Nonono when they were talking about redline they said "The man, the myth, the legend" this is completely different
 Dragonite#5414: nice recognise your username
 Yollie#2239: Tried? No, I succeeded. Have you seen how many people are in his cult now?
 Chimplement#7074: yeah
 Redline#7370: exactly
 Zoro5168#0115: Whos that now
 Dragonite#5414: Did you make the drone game for brackeys jam?
 Chimplement#7074: was this how you tried to make redline famous
 JuliusCube#8501: i no joke though have made games in desmos, which is pretty cool
 Chimplement#7074: the best option 😎
 lilburlap#8480: I swapped devices so much for a couple years that I've become... half-passable with a completely website-built gamedev setup
 Yollie#2239: ITS THE MAN THE LEGEND THE MYTH
 Zoro5168#0115: Nah i use nokia
 Redline#7370: the pro gamers make games for the NES
 RedTeapot#1960: Totally not an outdated reply: Godot
 Chimplement#7074: always fun to see familiars in a jam chat
 JuliusCube#8501: do any of you have experience in making games with a TI-84 graphing calculator? im looking forward to using that as my engine /j
 Zoro5168#0115: I havent coded in a few months
 snuffysam#2767: maybe they mean emotional unity
 Zoro5168#0115: Wisdom
 Redline#7370: tell it to unbreak itself (works, not clickbait)
 samcox08#6606: Unity, for this time. Maybe I'll go with UE in the future.
 Zoro5168#0115: My pc is broken
 Redline#7370: it starts in like 5 days I think
 lilburlap#8480: Ok I can still participate in the game jam
 JuliusCube#8501: for good reason as well, its a great game engine
 Redline#7370: "unity account" hmmmm
 lilburlap#8480: Wait I need to check if forkphorus is still up and running one second
 JuliusCube#8501: agreed, godot is gaining fast
 Scolon#4218: In fact I'm going to setup an empty webgl project today to make sure my configs are still working correctly
 snuffysam#2767: the last big jam i was in, i think most of the games i played were Godot
 Redline#7370: The only problem tbh I have with unreal engine for gamejams is the large build size, like it's usually around 160mb compared to unity's like 30-40mb
 JuliusCube#8501: obv you can make anything with powerpoint. its turing complete yk, just like the TI-81 graphing calculators
 Scolon#4218: I used scratch like 8-9 years ago
 lilburlap#8480: I use forkphorus to convert to HTML. And I've been using scratch for so long that It'll take too long to switch for my lazy self
 DrNukeLear#2414: I did that back in '99
 Scolon#4218: I'm using Unity
 Yollie#2239: I started with scratch
 DrNukeLear#2414: I'd say 60%. Godot is gaining ground, Unreal Devotees are a thing and then there are the smaller engines.
 JuliusCube#8501: ive tried making a scratch game once as a joke and it was miserable
 Zoro5168#0115: Wisdom
 Redline#7370: no it's unity lol
 Redline#7370: I obviously the mastermind I am, use powerpoint as a game engine
 JuliusCube#8501: okay how
 Zoro5168#0115: Unity
 Yollie#2239: V8. Prefer it over the older models, it has more horsepower
 lilburlap#8480: Funny story: Scratch.
 Zoro5168#0115: This man has wisdom ingrained in him
 JuliusCube#8501: lets play a game, will unity be a 70% majority or a 90% majority?
 DrNukeLear#2414: Unity
 DrNukeLear#2414: So much so.... that it's in the trailer!
 Redline#7370: anyways asking everyone here, what game engine you are using?
 JuliusCube#8501: knowing mark hes probably gonna make the theme something that doesnt restrict the type of game you can make
 DrNukeLear#2414: Keyboards are an issue.
 Redline#7370: fishes breathe water obviously
 lilburlap#8480: Fish still breathe
 Zoro5168#0115: What if youre a fish
 Yollie#2239: Subnautica players literally crying right now
 Redline#7370: wait that's illegal you are not allowed to breathe in games
 Zoro5168#0115: No bloom more like no gain
 snuffysam#2767: i think most games probably have air in them, you just can't see it
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: that's true yeah
 Yollie#2239: Half of his graphics quality reduced to dust
 Redline#7370: hmm water?
 Yollie#2239: Redline in shambles
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: TO BE FAIR. fire has to be one of the most used elements in video games
 Redline#7370: that would actually be hilarious
 DrNukeLear#2414: or "No bloom"
 Redline#7370: it will work fine just need to tweak a lot
 lilburlap#8480: Every lose condition is an increasingly weird twist on the word fire
 Yollie#2239: And frozen peas
 Yollie#2239: It also has weird graphics which I don’t agree with
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: theme: avoid using fire
 JuliusCube#8501: no make triangular cosine
 Redline#7370: yes I'll make a game called flamebook for this jam
 Zoro5168#0115: Which means that book contains all the secrets of game making
 lilburlap#8480: I assume it's more of a pamphlet if it was made for a short game jam
 Zoro5168#0115: Fire means good though
 Yollie#2239: Redline is the only person in existence who is able to make a crappy knockoff of his own game which hasn’t even been released yet
 Redline#7370: well yes, but the full version has a complete different style and the story is different slightly
 JuliusCube#8501: "firebook"
 JuliusCube#8501: ah its the garbage knockoff version
 Zoro5168#0115: That should be a rule
 Redline#7370: (made in 3 days + terrible player movement)
 JuliusCube#8501: what is it not good or something
 Redline#7370: and put motion blur to max to trigger half of the playerbase
 RedcoatsRevolt (Adam)#1185: *writes down "study post-processing" and "bloom"*
 Redline#7370: don't play that frostbook please
 lilburlap#8480: What could go wro-*Computer crashing noise*
 Yollie#2239: I especially love the fisheye one it makes your game look a lot more smooth
 Zoro5168#0115: Source:trust me bro
 JuliusCube#8501: oh wait you were talking about frostbook, i didnt know you uploaded that
also when are you going to find the convert to html5 button in unity?
 Zoro5168#0115: And we were thinking about second person shi
 Yollie#2239: You must advertise in style
 Redline#7370: yesn't
 Yollie#2239: Bad redline
 Zoro5168#0115: The theme has been decided its bloom
 Yollie#2239: Ooohhh blatant advertising
 lilburlap#8480: Figuring out how to add bloom in scratch
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: figuring out how to add bloom to an ASCII game made in C and ncurses, brb
 Redline#7370: yes
 lilburlap#8480: I'll see if I can figure out how to throw bloom in with the tool I'm using
 Zoro5168#0115: Bloom good
 Redline#7370: yes join the funny
 Zoro5168#0115: No i join in too
 Yollie#2239: Currently it’s just redline and selviam
 Zoro5168#0115: Yes but its a law
 Yollie#2239: Another member of the bloom cult
 Redline#7370: I was about to put an image here but I can't do that unfortunately
 Selviam#7268: that sounds like a good rule lots of bloom
 Selviam#7268: ohhh
 Redline#7370: glow but post processing effect
 Redline#7370: hmm
 Yollie#2239: You see redline, propaganda is the key to success
 Zoro5168#0115: This guy can actually throw a couple grand around cuz i can see he's a business
 Yollie#2239: Shhhhhhhhhh
 Selviam#7268: but what is bloom?
 DrNukeLear#2414: Not an amount... just yes.
 Redline#7370: my most recent one isn't like that surprisingly
 Yollie#2239: Yeah
 JuliusCube#8501: except with extra minecraft
 Yollie#2239: Did you know literally like all of the games he makes are like this
 Redline#7370: yes
 RedTeapot#1960: But what about screenshake?
 Scolon#4218: Remember kids, turn your bloom up to max your game will look amazing :}
 JuliusCube#8501: step 4. make a 3d model of a dragon
ill shut up
 lilburlap#8480: I'm not too sure it just kinda felt like the next step in the joke
 Redline#7370: step 1. Bloom, lot's of bloom
step 2. make voxel 3d models
step 3. profit
 Yollie#2239: Yeah you’re right. Listen, redline is a dumb dummy who’s a bit heavy handed when it comes to bloom
 DrNukeLear#2414: Er... why?
 Zoro5168#0115: Mark left a mark on this world and red line drew a line over it
 JuliusCube#8501: yollie i think youre overhyping this a bit
 lilburlap#8480: Sorry mark we only listen to redlines design tips now
 Yollie#2239: The coup is starting bois! We shall lead a revolution!
 JuliusCube#8501: by making a game that looks really good and probably is really good but just cant run on my crappy laptop at over 5 fps
 Redline#7370: I still don't know exactly why I'm here but jam moment I guess
 Yollie#2239: The redline copy
 RedTeapot#1960: Apparently we got the new idol. Goodbye Mark!
 Yollie#2239: He is here to steal the show
 Redline#7370: pog
 JuliusCube#8501: i would send a screenshot but you cant send images here
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: video game development. this is videogame development, i think.
 Yollie#2239: The man, the myth, the legend, redline has walked into the stage
 Scolon#4218: oh my god it's the real redteapot
 RedTeapot#1960: What is going on in this chat lol
 Selviam#7268: ???
 Yollie#2239: You must not speak about the forbidden ones name
 lilburlap#8480: Please do
 DrNukeLear#2414: And Witcher 3
 Redline#7370: we don't talk about that
 Selviam#7268: whomst dragon?
 theChief#0001: I'm in awe of them tbh
 Redline#7370: hmm yes
 JuliusCube#8501: no... its a little more complicated than that
i think the whomst dragon incident should explain who he is
 lilburlap#8480: Maybe like a purple carpet to keep the rich feeling
 Zoro5168#0115: Same
 Yollie#2239: They made minecraft
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: did you make the purple neon game?
 Yollie#2239: Minecraft developer
 Redline#7370: I exist and use a ton of bloom
 Scolon#4218: They are a red line i guess
 Yollie#2239: No they’re just uh
 Zoro5168#0115: Hi me reincarnated
 Hederlunden#3231: holy shit is that redline
 Hobusu#5033: That games like Doom Eternal or Diablo 3 have been ported to Switch is frankly miraculous
 Teslobo#8274: You can have the living room rug
 Redline#7370: no
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: did they win the last jam or something?
 JuliusCube#8501: people have no idea who redline is tho lmao
 lilburlap#8480: They'll blend in
 Redline#7370: no don't do that
 Yollie#2239: People we need to lay a red carpet the real redline is here
 JuliusCube#8501: redline hello
 JuliusCube#8501: woah
 Redline#7370: I am indeed here
 Yollie#2239: OH ITS THE REAL REDLINE
 DrNukeLear#2414: Interesting
 JuliusCube#8501: youre lucky you didnt need to port it to switch
to wouldve gone to 20 bullets at 2 fps if youre lucky
 Yollie#2239: Yes exactly
 Selviam#7268: Ooooo
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: platformer with a focus on story :3
 RedTeapot#1960: And think from time to time about finishing it kek
 lilburlap#8480: same
 Selviam#7268: what kinda game is it?
 Yollie#2239: Even if the game is good and I made it hyper modular
 Yollie#2239: I make a game and leave it to collect dust
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: hey it’s only been a few months
 Yollie#2239: Wow that’s dedication
 Yollie#2239: Oh thank god
 theChief#0001: ah no, xbox one 😂 went from 10,000 bullets at 60fps on my PC to...
those consoles were not built with high CPU usage in mind!
 Yollie#2239: No chief don’t say it don’t ruin these peoples motivation
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: I’m still working on my game from the brackeys jam
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i've done 1 and a half (the half is a solo jam)
 JuliusCube#8501: im not spotted_leaf but ive done like 8 at this point
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: ohhhh thought you meant like original xbox!
 lilburlap#8480: This'll be my 4th too if you count the time I didn't publish to the last gmtk jam
 Zoro5168#0115: Maybe i was reincarnated
 JuliusCube#8501: but also no idea other than that
 Zoro5168#0115: Ok
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: i think this will be my fourth jam
 JuliusCube#8501: a guy we know from brackeys jam
 Yollie#2239: Not sure
 theChief#0001: it wasn't the architecture, it was just that the last gen consoles were... something
current gen is great, no problems there!
 Zoro5168#0115: Whos redline
 Yollie#2239: Oh god it’s redline
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: kind of like ps3
 theChief#0001: too true! How many have you done now? 😁
 JuliusCube#8501: the one with the suspiciously shaped tail? yeah i get that
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: oh god isn't xbox one of those consoles with really weird architectures that makes it really difficult to develop for?
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: i suppose this Marks (haha) a year of doing jams! jams are the best
 Zoro5168#0115: My pfp technically has a triangle made from the swords angles
 Lawn#1538: Thoughts and prayers for you.
 JuliusCube#8501: yeah but he doesnt have a triangle as his profile picture
 Yollie#2239: With that dragon and all
 Lawn#1538: Editor vs Build is the real challenge in game dev
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: a year ago I participated in the GMTK game jam for the first time and I had a great time
 Zoro5168#0115: Sus
 Yollie#2239: You know this zoro guy reminds me of redline a lot
 theChief#0001: 
then I tried to make it run on-device
 Zoro5168#0115: I read that as smthn else
 RedTeapot#1960: Now that is some stonks
 JuliusCube#8501: and also its very buggy
 JuliusCube#8501: uhh its not a "tas" tool in that video yet
 Nobody6502#8971: Your outer wilds tas tool looks neat
 Yollie#2239: If you’re very stupid I must be a single celled organism
 JuliusCube#8501: a year ago i was pinging mark about a luigi profile picture and also stupid, now i have 80 subscribers on youtube, have made beating a space game without a spacesuit possible to do, and am still incredibly stupid
 Scolon#4218: But yeah I don't know why reply ping is on by default
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: being stupid isn't something one simply gets to opt out, it's a race 👍
 Yollie#2239: All servers should have a thing where you’re allowed to ping the owner once for every dollar donated
 Zoro5168#0115: Birdbrain
 theChief#0001: I'm still very stupid now 👍
 theChief#0001: most people were very stupid a year ago
 Zoro5168#0115: Mjolnir im coming for ya
 Scolon#4218: Character development
 Yollie#2239: I feel you 😭
 JuliusCube#8501: i was very stupid a year ago
 Yollie#2239: I heard that you get a special hammer if you ping him 100 times
 JuliusCube#8501: i dont remember the specifics but no i did not get banned because it wasnt spam-pinging
it was random pings when replying to messages...
and also that one case where I asked him if im infringing on his badly drawn mario trademark if i set a badly drawn luigi as my profile picture
 Zoro5168#0115: Ull be respected for the rest of ur life
 Zoro5168#0115: Nah go for the half century ultimate speedrun
 Yollie#2239: 49 pings will suffice for now
 Yollie#2239: And he didn’t get banned? Well, human curiosity can’t be inhibited!
 JuliusCube#8501: yes, i have learned my lesson and know how to turn pings for replies off
 Zoro5168#0115: Just have a couple grand ready and everything will be fine
 JuliusCube#8501: i dont think anyone remembers that but it was an actual thing
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: that sounds like a high way to getting banned from ever partecipating in any gmtk jam again honestly!
 Yollie#2239: If you ping him 48 times I think he will give you a discount
 JuliusCube#8501: how about getting a couple grand to throw at mark so he will allow me to beat my record of pinging mark 47 times in 2 days /j
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: oh god yeah
 Yollie#2239: The best preparation is not doing jams, nothing’s worse than jam burnout
 Zoro5168#0115: Who needs practice when u havent coded in 3 months
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: oh i could practice by remaking an old jam game in godot since that old jam game was in unity
 Zoro5168#0115: The true answer
 JuliusCube#8501: practicing? who needs to practice when I can procrastinate
 Scolon#4218: Taking necessary precautions to prevent tons of bugs arising/submission issues, practicing before-hand, sleeping & eating properly, etc
 Yollie#2239: To throw at different people
 theChief#0001: if you can find them, absolutely yes!
 JuliusCube#8501: as in, has slept more than an hour in the previous 2 days, or has a list of everything they need to do
 Zoro5168#0115: Which u will 100% of the time
 Yollie#2239: A couple grand on hand
 Zoro5168#0115: Or if u have bug
 JuliusCube#8501: what counts as "prepared"
 Scolon#4218: tbh 1 person is only stressful if you aren't prepared
 Yollie#2239: 1 person is a stressful experience, however, if you have good teamwork 15 people is the epic experience
 RedTeapot#1960: I've seen a sort of ARG-ish game done that way
 Coffe#5594: would it be worth having dedicated testers?
 Tyrix#6647: unless maybe you make some kind of meta game that sends you from itch page to itch page ... but then i would honestly only enter the "entrance" page into the jam
 JuliusCube#8501: my team is this:
me - coding, coding, coding, game design, and also art^
 Zoro5168#0115: Thats the spirit,make sure to buy a time stopper so u can learn allof that
 Scolon#4218: Small teams are best for game jams, I wouldn't have more than 3 people if you want a relaxed experience
 JuliusCube#8501: you dont need more
 Yollie#2239: Sure! Send your address, phone number, credit card number, the expiration date and the 3 digits on the back and I’ll give you the money in 2 - 3 business days
 Coffe#5594: wondering whether my team should look for more people. Right now there are 2 of us that know each other irl and have worked together before. Between us we already have coding, music, art, and design skills. If we add more people we then need like team management, and communication becomes harder (especially if they're a coder).
 JuliusCube#8501: screw it im buying myself a full drum set, guitar, $10 million piano, and studio so i can make music for the jam /j
 Scolon#4218: Throw your money on the ground
 Lawn#1538: Throw some money my way if you're just throwing it wherever.
 Lawn#1538: Style-wise, anything really. Depends on the game.
 Yollie#2239: However, you *can* throw money at theChief and he might do it for you
 Zoro5168#0115: I think small 8 bit music loops and sound effects with sfxr
 JuliusCube#8501: there isnt a point
 JuliusCube#8501: same, imo its the best way to do a jam
 Yollie#2239: Money can’t solve everything, you can’t throw money on your code
 Lawn#1538: Adaptive audio with FMOD, with everything either made with soft synths in Ableton Live or hardware synths if I can be bothered recording audio.
 JuliusCube#8501: which one has the best result to time needed ratio
 Scolon#4218: I come up with a general style of game I want to make and then see how I can fit the theme to that
 Zoro5168#0115: Pay a couple grand🤣
 snuffysam#2767: unless it's a game jam where it's suggested to do work beforehand & the themes are optional, i've participated in those before
 Zoro5168#0115: I do no. 1
 lilburlap#8480: Music: Next to none/musical sound effects
sfx: uhhh we'll see
 Yollie#2239: I want adaptive but it seems a tad ambitious
 Tyrix#6647: yes, and i don't see a reason, why you shouldn't be able to do that ... just don't see the point.
 Zoro5168#0115: Alright guys what music and sound u using?(adaptive,bit-music,8bit-sfx,idk)
 RocketCow#5210: Yeah, don't forget sound. Nothing feels emptier than an entirely quiet game.
 snuffysam#2767: th-the second one?
 JuliusCube#8501: which one of these do you guys do:
- think of a game before the theme is announced and then twist the game to work with the theme
or
- wait till the theme is announced then think of a game
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: in 2 day jams that's only natural honestly
 Lawn#1538: The forgotten child.
 Lawn#1538: And sound.
 Lawn#1538: Music
 Zoro5168#0115: Alright so what should i ask about next,art and camera are done
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Or having another team member submit for you 😅
 JuliusCube#8501: well nothings stopping you from making multiple accounts
 theChief#0001: oh wait really? Maybe I wasn't the submitter on all of them then. Oops, my bad 😅
 Scolon#4218: Best I can do is 0$
 Yollie#2239: A couple grand for a jam game seems like a bad return.... best I could do is 7$
 Tyrix#6647: you can join multiple teams, but itch only allows for one entry per account
 JuliusCube#8501: nice, tell them to join the server if they want to
 Zoro5168#0115: Just give another person couple grand to make game for you 🤣
 Yollie#2239: Oh and  redlines doing jam
 RedTeapot#1960: This gives me an idea... What if I submit one game several times? I wonder how the ratings would differ between them
 JuliusCube#8501: im not because im (usually, probably) a good sport
 snuffysam#2767: depending on your role on the team it's not so unreasonable
 Yollie#2239: Good luck if youre gonna do that though
 theChief#0001: there are three jams in the past where I've submitted multiple projects because I was on a few different teams at the same time 😂
 theChief#0001: you can, yeah 🙂
 JuliusCube#8501: can you submit multiple projects? im assuming no in order to avoid duplicates.
 Zoro5168#0115: Yea im totally not sleep deprived to the point where my vision is blurry im absolutely sure
 RedTeapot#1960: I think making another "submission" would work actually
 theChief#0001: I just said "yes" because I'm a dingus and thought I was deleting the (broken) web build 😂
 theChief#0001: like, a MASSIVE red warning that stops you and says "are you _sure_"
 Zoro5168#0115: If there isnt
 theChief#0001: there's a massive red warning that pops up
 Zoro5168#0115: There should be feature for that
 theChief#0001: if you submit then delete your build, you're out of luck unfortunately
 theChief#0001: that's just for late submissions 😅
 RedTeapot#1960: Really? I think there was a feature allowing making a special submission link for just one person
 Zoro5168#0115: That has happened to me
 Yollie#2239: Which is why you must slip them a few grand :)
 JuliusCube#8501: fair point, wouldnt wanna wait till the next july so i can have a shot at winning the jam
imo the winning of the jam isnt what its about tho, its about staying up until 3 am trying to fix that one bug that randomly breaks the entire game. Except the catch is that the bug randomly goes in and out of reality and only occurs when you look in a specific angle or something.
 theChief#0001: (and I'm not hosting this one)
 theChief#0001: actually no, they can't 😂 you'd have to re-enable uploads for the ENTIRE jam
which I have done on jams in the past, but they're WAY smaller than this one xD
 Yollie#2239: 👀
 Zoro5168#0115: Not speaking from expirence right?😅
 Scolon#4218: I want to upload a prototype of my game within like few hours of the jam starting and then go from there
 lilburlap#8480: That has to be very embarrassing to need to message mods about
 RedTeapot#1960: Early promotion (like publishing your game on the first day) may help (and it really did help me in 2021) but you know, getting a working game in the first day is hard
 Yollie#2239: Psst. If you ask kindly and slip the admin a few grand they might just fix it for you :)
 Scolon#4218: Just make sure, I can upload my game before the deadline and still make updates to it as long as it's before the deadline right?
 Tyrix#6647: yes, you can edit the page, just not update the game
 Zoro5168#0115: But the fear of having to wait another year and all your work being wasted is still a big fear
 Coffe#5594: I like this idea 🧠
 RedTeapot#1960: Yeah, and I _believe_ people actually do that so it should be fine
 JuliusCube#8501: wouldnt call it existential terror imo, not like the sun is exploding or anything
 Zoro5168#0115: That end time existential terror,horror,fear is all im about
 JuliusCube#8501: master procrastinator but also master itch page maker
 Coffe#5594: exporting took me a couple attempts, and I ended up reuploading tiny changes a couple times
 snuffysam#2767: yeah technically i think there's no rule about editing the description after the submission deadline?
 Coffe#5594: it def takes longer than you'd expect :p
 Zoro5168#0115: Yes
 RedTeapot#1960: But theming, screenshots etc. can be postponed. The most important part is to upload your game before the deadline, the rest can be changed afterwards. It might affect the number of plays you get though
 Yollie#2239: Be like the pro gamer I am and leave it to the last 10 minutes 😎
 Coffe#5594: but yeah I guess just having it could save some time
 Coffe#5594: from my practice jam I found that the longest part of the itch page was like theming, descriptions, screenshots, uploading the web export
 snuffysam#2767: step 1) open itch.io
step 2) click upload new project
step 3) give it some placeholder title like "my GMTKjam  project"
step 4) save the page
 Tyrix#6647: set up a project (and version control if you are in a team),
make an itch page,
test if everything you need is setup and works.
if you can automate processes that easily go wrong like building and uploading your game.
also think about what you need during the jam. prepare food or at least a make a plan beforehand, sleep enough, make breaks if you need them.
 theChief#0001: making an itch page early is a great call!
 JuliusCube#8501: speedrun strats
 Coffe#5594: how? 🤔
 snuffysam#2767: oh also i'm gonna make the itch page lol
 snuffysam#2767: i'm going to make a unity project with the aspect ratio for the web export set up
importing into itch always takes a few tries for me
 Zoro5168#0115: My pc is broken ,i havent practiced in a long time so basically my prewok is in negative integers
 Coffe#5594: so is anyone making utility modules or doing any prework? Thinking of how to effectively prepare
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I can't wait to start playing all of these games.
 Zoro5168#0115: People making good games to win 🙅‍♂️
Me making others make fun games indirectly so i can play them👍
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I should finish my renpy story game. It's been laying there for the past months
 DrNukeLear#2414: Hello there
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: one day i do wanna go back to this. i think the gameplay really lended itself well to the atmosphere of darkness and danger the game had
 JuliusCube#8501: well i guess im not making a TAS tool anymore and instead working on a game about softlocking
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Sounds like fun.
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Same.
 snuffysam#2767: go for it lol, i wanna see a game like this!
 JuliusCube#8501: it just depends on how well i execute it
 JuliusCube#8501: might have to steal that idea thank you /hj
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I got myself soft locked in kindergarten 2 once.
 JuliusCube#8501: just wake up and go jump behind a tree to get softlocked
 JuliusCube#8501: oh that could be extremely fun.
reminds me of that 4 second softlock% speedrun of outer wilds that i saw once
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: the theme was temperature or something similar, so the idea was that you had a temperature meter and you had to alternate between fire shots and ice shots to maintain your temperature, which would need to be stable or otherwise you would lose health
 snuffysam#2767: that would actually be an interesting gimmick for a game
you're dropped in some puzzle platformer or something, and you have to softlock the level as fast as possible
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i made a twin stick shooter heavily aesthetically inspired by metroid. it was so fun to make
 Zoro5168#0115: Even minimalistic stuff can look and feel good with nice speedy gameplay
 JuliusCube#8501: last time i did a game jam i made basically a metroidvania except with some outer wilds elements (so basically, a metroidbrainia) and I somehow succeeded in not becoming last
according to my friends it would also be my best game if it didnt have so many softlocks
 lilburlap#8480: Just gotta add every effect I know of and see how it turns out
 caibi#2508: ee (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: that jam was very very very informative for what to do in a game jam setting. for example, doing a complex save system was SUCH a huge time sink, even in a 7 day jam
 snuffysam#2767: i'm fairly good at modeling & rigging (well, mixamo is good at rigging) humanoid models quickly so i should be able to make a 3D game in the time limit
 Yollie#2239: Yes it is I
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i got #45 in the beginner circle jam for my game, my best score being community spirit (#33) with a raw score of 4.500
 snuffysam#2767: i haven't done a 3D game for a game jam (well, i've done prerendered 3D graphics, and 2D sprites moved in 3D, but not 3D models in a 3D game) so i want to try that
 lilburlap#8480: You just need to make it look fun not impressive
 Zoro5168#0115: Dont forget to add bloom
 Zoro5168#0115: 5/5 for visuals
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Helloo
 lilburlap#8480: 3 boxes moving around the screen at most
 Zoro5168#0115: Me too man me too
 snuffysam#2767: gonna do low-ish poly 3D for sure
 theChief#0001: I got 7th place in bullet hell jam (out of about 350) in visuals with just simple shapes 😁
 Zoro5168#0115: Nice i did the same in zeno game jam
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: that too, yeah
 caibi#2508: school day, haha
 Lawn#1538: Or enormous teams.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: better art is for post-jam development
 Zoro5168#0115: Same
 JuliusCube#8501: i got 50th place in the brackeys jam with only circles and unitys particle system im not changing that
and also 9th in game design
 theChief#0001: Minimalist, always minimalist 😂 it's just so easy - a few simple shapes and some bloom
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: again this is going to be very much dependant on the kind of theme that comes up, probably pixel art though
 RocketCow#5210: low poly, solid colours, fast and easy
 Zoro5168#0115: I can draw but i dont know how to use drawing programs and tiles
 JuliusCube#8501: minimalistic obv im garbage at drawing
 Zoro5168#0115: Alright since camera talk is over what art style will yall be using?(pixel,realistic,minimalistic)
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: at least you can post links even if they don't embed
 JuliusCube#8501: well yeah probably
 snuffysam#2767: i imagine you can post videos in  if nothing else
 JuliusCube#8501: just make an ascii game no need to render it as ascii
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: perfect 😄
 JuliusCube#8501: well the main thing i was asking about there was the videos/other stuff part, not the images part.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i'm going to render each progress screenshot as an ascii image and post it there
 Zoro5168#0115: Itsok
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: it wouldn't be much use if you couldn't
 Zoro5168#0115: U make good point but i think it can be tied quite nicely with a mysterious story to make a game with atleast a good amount of gameplay
 Lawn#1538: Yes, you will indeed be able to post images when that opens.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i think honestly that second person is just third person with added extra steps that make it somewhat clunky and hard to work with, personally
 JuliusCube#8501: im assuming youll be able to send images/videos/other stuff in  eventually
 Tyrix#6647: oh, missed that ^^ ... i thought you were just making a joke
 Jeker#3389: oh, yeah you are right, my bad
 Lawn#1538: I think they show up as links for non-Patrons
 JuliusCube#8501: however, its more of a one-off thing than a whole-game thing
 Jeker#3389: I can send gifs tho
 Zoro5168#0115: Its unexplored territory i think mich can be done with it if it is applied to different genres
 Jeker#3389: uhhhh
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: for patreons
 Jeker#3389: oh hey gifs are now allowed? Nice!
 Zoro5168#0115: http://teamfinder.gmtkgamejam.com/
 Alvino Pingvino#9499: Okay 👍 Thank you
 Lawn#1538: Welcome! Check out the team finder  for all the deets.
 Alvino Pingvino#9499: I did not find that channel
 Zoro5168#0115: Aswell
 Zoro5168#0115: Goto team finder
 Alvino Pingvino#9499: Hey. Im looking for a team for the jam. I am a quite noobie coder and work in C#. I’m looking for more people like me (noobies) to work with on the game. Contact me if you are interested.
 JuliusCube#8501: i like the idea of a second person game but imo there isnt too much you can do with it
 Zoro5168#0115: thats like the exact thing i said more than 30 minutes ago
 JuliusCube#8501: I was for like a week before some guy beat my record by 2 tenths of a second
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: I’m so excited for this jam because our pre-jam practice game is already super fun, and we’ve only spent 24 hours on it!
 Zoro5168#0115: Its cool as liquid nitrogen
 JuliusCube#8501: which is cool
 JuliusCube#8501: idk where i can say this but im the (former) world record holder for untitled magnet game any% (v2.0)
 Zoro5168#0115: Alright so second person games huh
 JuliusCube#8501: yep
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: hey  and  ! i think i remember you two from the brackeys jam right?
 Lawn#1538: *dad has entered the chat*
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Hey Tyrix
 Tyrix#6647: Hi back!
 Zoro5168#0115: Im back
 Yollie#2239: Probably tho
 JuliusCube#8501: im gonna bet on maybe
 Yollie#2239: Idk I’ll ask
 JuliusCube#8501: do you think redline will join as well
 JuliusCube#8501: hello yollie
 Yollie#2239: Oh sup Juliuscube
 JuliusCube#8501: there was a video last year that announced the discord and team finder simoultaneously, so thats why i was a bit confused i guess
 snuffysam#2767: yeah it was mentioned on the itch page that the discord would be opening on the 8th, but not on youtube iirc
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: yeah that does seem like an oversight
 JuliusCube#8501: not for the game jam, i knew about the game jam one
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: ah right!
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i entered after checking the page because i remembered (wrongly) that the jam started tomorrow and i accidentally arranged for a starfinder session with my playpod on the 12th
 JuliusCube#8501: i mean announcement for the discord
 JuliusCube#8501: oh there was a link there?
 JuliusCube#8501: there was no announcement video tho as far as i know, so i had to go through some of the old videos to find this invite link
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: but the jam doesn't start for a while yet
 JuliusCube#8501: ah okay
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: two days ago!
 JuliusCube#8501: when did this server open up again for the game jam
This one it the reaction.
 snuffysam#2767: you're arguably controlling the narrator's actions too?
it is kinda the point of the game, trying to get the narrator to do unique things
 Lawn#1538: Ya'll got me on Youtube watching second person game videos
 DrNukeLear#2414: If you press the shoot button, the character you are looking at shoots, because they are the player character. But the camera is viewing from the other character.
 lilburlap#8480: A past self situation or are they copying every move you make?
 Zoro5168#0115: Yeah like two people fighting in an arena but the person fighting you is you
 RocketCow#5210: In the end it's just semantics. Until somebody actually does it to an extend that most people agree on it being 2nd person 🤷‍♀️
 lilburlap#8480: Maybe you'd get an indication of when you've bumped into a wall or something to let you find your way around
 DrNukeLear#2414: Nice
 lilburlap#8480: I feel like it'd also be dun as a hide-and-seek multiplayer game where the seekers see from the hiders perspective and the hiders see from the seekers perspective but neither of them really knows where they are on the map
 RocketCow#5210: ye
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: the most defining thing about second person in things like literature is the in-world presence of the PoV the reader takes. for example in sherlock holmes we take the point of view of watson, who is an in-world character. in games however the way you talk about cameras is more or less about where it's positioned and not so much on who it's positioned on. a game is 3rd person because the player doesn't see things from the perspective of who they're playing as, while a game is first person because the player sees things as if they were in the game themselves. so for example, that duelist game would be just a somewhat unconventional 3rd person game
 ConstantDerivative#6302: i am extremely excited for the game jam
 RocketCow#5210: well, the thing about second person, even in language, is that it is *technically* just first person, but the speaker is not the acting party. Suggestions about seeing your character through somebody else's eyes is *really* just third person with an unconventional camera. But for instance something like Halo: Reach's cutscenes aren't described as second person, despite the fact that you see your own character through the eyes of an invisible camera man.
 DrNukeLear#2414: And would add to the challenge
 lilburlap#8480: That sounds both cool and incredibly disorientating
 DrNukeLear#2414: A duelling game where you control one duellist's actions but see their actions from the other duellist's perspective would work... and be dope.
 RocketCow#5210: That's the only way I could see it done. Wouldn't consider it cheating myself, but I know what you mean.
 lilburlap#8480: The closest I can imagine is a text adventure but that feels a little bit like cheating
 DrNukeLear#2414: You have control over the point of view and the action, it doesn't qualify. The narrator actually directs some actions but you don't have to obey them.
 lilburlap#8480: I meant the narrator is their own character but idk how you'd play that in a video game
 RocketCow#5210: I honestly don't think that you can really create an equivalent to second person in a visual medium. It is very much a linguistic classification and I don't think it translates.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: and if that's the case, you're not playing second person, you're playing first person as the narrator
 lilburlap#8480: From what you've described it sounds like narrator with extra privileges
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: the term feels more like an incorrect translation from the literary term
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: second person camera doesn't mean much to me because in videogames the perspective of the camera is really what matters and the controls are a separate thing
 Lawn#1538: The Stanley Parable kind of ticks the second person box.
 Dragonite#5414: Yeah would a second person game not just be like viewing the game through a fixed camera which is technically someone else’s eyes
 dardasaba#9759:   ;)
 PyxelGamesStudios#2803: Bro I Can Not Wait For GMKT Game Jam 2022!!!
 lilburlap#8480: But in a video game
 lilburlap#8480: Like playing with a GM?
 DrNukeLear#2414: Driver3 did it on one level I think.
 Zoro5168#0115: Basically youre just looking and controlling your charachter through some other character's eyes which is not subject to your control
 Zoro5168#0115: Watch a video from nick robinson on youtube called "this is what a second person video game would look like"
 lilburlap#8480: Time zone: All
 Zoro5168#0115: No
 Shimp#0064: wouldn't that be third person then
 Lawn#1538: Or a bot.
 Lawn#1538: Mine is not included because I'm always awake.
 Zoro5168#0115: Not necessarily  it can face the back of the charachter too
 lilburlap#8480: It took until now for me to realize that the 3 letters after a lot of your pronouns is your time zone
 Lawn#1538: Seems like there would be a lot of weight on the facial animations for this type of game, so I'm out.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: ooh that's interesting
 Lawn#1538: I can get on board with this concept.
 DrNukeLear#2414: That could be workable.
 Lawn#1538: For devs, but mostly me, they may not be ready for the truth.
 Shimp#0064: second person, where you look only at the face of your character
 Zoro5168#0115: Havent decided
 Lawn#1538: Since you asked, what kind of camera are you intending on using?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: wait, for what?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: oh cool!
 Lawn#1538: I've been making a game kind of similar to that for a couple of friends. Torches light your immediate surrounds but you can pick up torch upgrades and activate other lights to avoid traps and being cornered.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: or - and this is mostly a joke option - you make the most bland 2d platformer you can think of. lack of vision in the sense that your game has no vision at all and is just generic
 DrNukeLear#2414: Or the game could leverage the concept of hidden information.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: lack of vision doesn't seem to me like it'd strictly be games without the ability to see. for example, what about a game where your goal is to remove a lack of vision by lighting up torches in a dungeon? or, a game where you have to do the opposite and it's first person 3D - the game's difficulty naturally gets higher as you progress
 Zoro5168#0115: The game is called shadeshift on itch.io if anyone wants to check it out
 DrNukeLear#2414: Poor vision isn't always complete darkness.
 AussieBoi#1561: I'm getting better tho : )
 AussieBoi#1561: The only way I could possibly do that is just put a big sprite around the camera
 Zoro5168#0115: The game which came no.1 in the brackeys game jam can apply to that theme and it was amazing
 Tyrix#6647: but all the poor artists D:
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: yeah the idea itself seems interesting, i can think of some ways i'd personally do it
 Lawn#1538: It'd certainly fruit some interesting ideas.
 Lawn#1538: Not such a bad restriction. I've seen it work in the audio jam circles.
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: depends on the idea i get from the theme, but probably not isometric, because i don't have any experience with that. if i decide to go for a hail mary and go for 3d, though, it's gonna be anyone's game
 Shimp#0064: imagine if the theme will imply lack of vision
 Lawn#1538: Likely top-down or first person.
 DrNukeLear#2414: Freaking Crazy.
 Zoro5168#0115: Which camera type will your games be using? (top-down,platformer cam,isometric)
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: i also did do a 2 day thing on my own to challenge myself but that and the beginner circle jam were both in unity. hoping that this jam's gonna help solidify my godot skills
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: nope! it wassss... let me check. it was beginner circle jam for 2021 i Think?
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: 
 BadPiggy#5202: 7dfps ?
 ewe (‾◡◝)#9151: hello, this is gonna be my Second jam ever, first with godot, hope it all goes well! not too used to the time limit, my only other jam was a 7 day jam
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: You're not 🍊
 slightlybonkers#4912: wait why can't i react to messages
 Lawn#1538: Asset Forge and MagicaVoxel are decent options if Blender is not your cup of tea.
 hierr777#8659: I RETURN ON MY MAIN ACC!!
 Lawn#1538: I've gotten away with janky character rigs in Mixamo for most animations though.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: With your foot
 Lawn#1538: Yeah the animation is probably the killer for me too
 Jeker#3389: Yeah, I am not blaming blender, I just tried it for fun, not really into 3d animation/modeling
 Lawn#1538: I think I've given it a go at least 4 times now, and it's only now starting to sink in.
 slightlybonkers#4912: lmao same
 slightlybonkers#4912: is there any way to kick my post onto the top again?
 Lawn#1538: It gets easier every time you try.
 Jeker#3389: tried it once, made me punch my computer, 10/10 thank you blender 👍
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Blender is great.
 Lawn#1538: Skin modifier in Blender is OP too.
 DrNukeLear#2414: I'm thinking 3d logic, 2d display.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Fair enough. Lol.
 Tyrix#6647: just not used to it, having a team not used to it. not a good start for a 3d 48h jam lol
 Lawn#1538: I use MagicaVoxel to design my levels, because it's just so damn easy.
 BravoDS (Music/SFX)#0694: I still didn't decide yet. Last two years I workd on a 3D games. This year it would be cool to make 2D game. Also I think about UE5)) some new features are really nice and it is interesting to explore them
 Lawn#1538: That would be me, if I can find the time.
 slightlybonkers#4912: not me finding a single teammate from the teamfinder 😭
 RedTeapot#1960: I kinda thought about voxels. Not for a 48-hour jam though
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824:
 _Nate#3737: I want to try but I've never made a 3D game. Debating between making something good and making something to learn gooder
 Tyrix#6647: hell no xD
 Jeker#3389: You got it mate, sorry I got a bit carried away myself
 dardasaba#9759: 👍
 MrBen#0001: hey mark!
 Mark Brown#6982: Hi all! A reminder that, as per the rules, “we expect you to make the vast majority of the game during this time”
And while you can use “pre-existing code, libraries, and functions,” we ask that you “don’t write code specifically for this jam, ahead of time.”
Some of the messages in here sound like people are trying to make significant progress before the jam begins, with the intention of pivoting the design to match the theme. That’s not within the spirit of the rules - please play fair, and use the jam for its intended purpose: to flex your creative muscles and to challenge yourself.
 MrBen#0001: yes
 Yollie#2239: Dear these “red jam believers”,
If most jam is red, then why is it STRAWberry jam and not REDberry jam?
from,
Yollie
 DrNukeLear#2414: Don’t tell the chief. Most Jam is red.
 Lawn#1538: Oh yeah, I should probably scroll wayyy back lol
 theChief#0001: this wouldn't be valid in black & white jam though  which is what the original conversation was about!
 Lawn#1538: Mind you, not 3D.
 Lawn#1538: And you can do a lot with black and white
 Lawn#1538: Restricted colour palettes have really driven computer game aesthetics.
 Yollie#2239: This is sick as hell
 R2D2Vader#0693: :0 massive brain
 DrNukeLear#2414: And a secret ending where you meet Rick (who then deserts you?)
 R2D2Vader#0693: Hahaha make sure to add a rythm game minigame where you have to correctly play the rythm for the synth part at the start from memory or the game deletes your save file
 DrNukeLear#2414: Perfect. I’m going to make “Rick Wildly” a game where you follow your dreams of becoming a Rick Astley cover artist enduring the WILD highs and lows while screaming “Never gonna give you up”
 NitramiuZ#4145: It must be fun for Mark when everybody speculates about the theme while most likely nobody is correct
 R2D2Vader#0693: THEME LEAK the theme is gonna be "Wild" guys!!!
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: It's gonna be *wild!*
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Also my 6th Jam.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: This is my 3rd GMTK.
 R2D2Vader#0693: i've never done a game jam before 😳 ~~though i've done a game marmalade~~
 OrangeKingdom#9769: I am so exciting
This my second game jam
 theChief#0001: Nice! 😁
 Nobody6502#8971: Might have a team 👀
 Yollie#2239: Well, still better than nothing!
 theChief#0001: yeah, sorry - I never went back to update it xD
 Yollie#2239: Aw it’s only camera shake and grid stuff
 Yollie#2239: WOAH theChief code? So automatic carry!
 Lyfe#8258: Oh okay
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: There will be a  channel that opens closer to when the jam starts for stuff like this 🙂
 Lyfe#8258: yo im not certain if I'm allowed to post the link cuz self promotion, but i made a server for the 2020/21 jam for people who don't wanna be in a team but still want help/testing/talking in a smaller group than this giant server
 theChief#0001: oh absolutely 😁
 Jeker#3389: I am sure its really good, but I preefer making my own systems, if you get what i am saying
 theChief#0001: sure! It's there for reference if you need it though 🙂
 theChief#0001: ah
 Jeker#3389: Oh, nice lol, I wont use it, but thats nice of you
 Jeker#3389: Yeah, its just the first time I do any procedural generation
 theChief#0001: nice, I love that sort of thing! Random walker generation is pretty straightforward, I'm sure you'll manage it 🙂
 Jeker#3389: well, i had an idea for a nuclear throne-like roguelike
 JQ2#4402: Seems like the real point is to do the opposite of what most everyone's instinct in game design is to do heh
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Scope tiny.
 theChief#0001: exactly, yeah 😂
 Jeker#3389: Hmmm, you know what, I think I would be out of rules, I will probably just put some notes down, and write it when the jam starts, thanks
 theChief#0001: if it's proc gen that you're planning on using in other projects, or you're planning on packaging it up and selling it/giving it away for free, or you're digging back through old code to use it - that would be ok
 theChief#0001: the spirit of the rule is that you don't make anything __specifically for this jam__ before the jam starts
 theChief#0001: we can't advise on specifics
 Jeker#3389: Hey, rule question. I am thinking of doing a roguelike, but the procedural generation i have thought of is kind off complicated, is it ok if I make just that part before hand?
 SlamBamActionman#7160:   I'll notify the team, however it seems that all devs are busy for the next few hours so it might be a while until we get a chance to look at it
 RedTeapot#1960: Maybe even a little bit of *Mark*down would help
 SlamBamActionman#7160: That *is* a good question
 Vanny96#6750: Is there any special character I could use?
I already tried: /n, , &#10; &#13;
And none of them worked
 theChief#0001: scope is SUPER important
 theChief#0001: yep this is exactly it 🙂
 Vanny96#6750: Does anyone know why the teamfinder webapp doesn't support new lines? 😢 all the entries look like walls of text
 BadPiggy#5202: Oink
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Hi piggy! Hi teapot!
 BadPiggy#5202: I'm playing a variety of games rn to get some ideas lol
 JQ2#4402: Yeah feels like you have to aim real low to get something out in 2 days
 DrNukeLear#2414: Excited, but nervous about building something over ambitious or worse unfocused.
 RedTeapot#1960: A bit nervous but hyped
 JQ2#4402: How yall feel about this jam comin up
 dardasaba#9759: Morning!
 Fire_eyes#3469: Mornin!
 JQ2#4402: Morning all
 MrBen#0001: sry
 MrBen#0001: kk
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Don't do rickrolls, please. It gets stale and annoying very quickly, especially when spammed in many channels.
 DrNukeLear#2414: God I hope the theme isn’t “Rickroll”
 theChief#0001: I love a good rickroll, don't get me wrong - but this isn't the place!
 theChief#0001: Yeah, don't do that.
 red777#8692: EASY RICKROLL
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: Please don't spam rick-rolls across channels 
 red777#8692: pls watch it
 gamedevperson#8448: hello chat
 theChief#0001:  is the best way to find people!
 TheGreyProphet10#2810: I am 2D artist looking for team
 BadPiggy#5202: Oink
 MrBen#0001:
 red777#8692: hi
 Panda S#8673: saying` the remote host has closed the socket`
 Panda S#8673: it worked fine at 1st then i changed organization name it gives me a error
 Panda S#8673: hey can someone help i tried creating a new collab project for the jam with plastic scm
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: It's cool ngl. The emotes look awesome
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: and why not?
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: it's a commissioned set by the regular server users
 DomG#9983: I was asking because im doing a bug bounties on a site and wanted to see if they could help with smthn
 THEspectre#1934:
 THEspectre#1934: why is mostly the emojis, link?
 THEspectre#1934: ?
 DomG#9983: anyone here do bug bounties?
 THEspectre#1934: hello guys!
Okay, thanks for the info!
 RedTeapot#1960: Does it allow optional arguments? Like, right now I have some optional named arguments that can be set in a key-value form, e.g. `/mybot command option1 = value1 option2 = value2`. If you don't specify `option1`, for example, a default value might be used instead. Although, probably, having a syntax that complex for commands might be a sign I'm going in the wrong direction...
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: It is not, I'm afraid - you can't upload it to itch.io for submission, and you can't require your game to use 3rd party downloads/tools to run (e.g. the discord app/website)
 DrNukeLear#2414: I wonder if building a discord bot game would be permitted in the Game Jam.
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: I recommend it - depending on what library you use, slash commands have a lot more control around parameter handling; you can specify the format/data type/allowed values for params, to avoid things getting too complex
 RedTeapot#1960: Cool, might use the proper commands for my bot instead of parsing messages manually. Although my command syntax is kinda complicated because there are quite a few parameters
 RedTeapot#1960: Hey!
 Ahsanulir1#0428: Hello?
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: It does not, no
 RedTeapot#1960: Does the message containing the command stay in the channel (visible for others)?
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: not sure we'd be able to get rid of the schedule command but it shouldn't do anything now that the bot can neither see nor post in the gamejam channels (and also isn't on)
Don't want the eldritch rage to fall on me for that though
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: I have conducted a ritual to banish the bot from the game jam channels
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: What on earth did I miss
 SlamBamActionman#7160:  Your robot is out of control!
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: oh right yeah ok I see the problem
 RedTeapot#1960: Is this bot used for patreon-only chats?
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: err
 Mark Brown#6982: Hey 🙂
 Mark Brown#6982:  Sorry Mods, have a look at that when you get a chance please 😛
 Mark Brown#6982: shouldn't happen 😛
 unityAccount#7810: ?
 Mark Brown#6982: that...
 Games Bot#9309: **[minecraft] time!** Summoning: 
 unityAccount#7810: Good good!
 vanderrich#9982: good afternoon xd
 Sodaguyz#4729: good morning! :DD
 DrNukeLear#2414: Nite
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: gn soda.
 vanderrich#9982: 4pm ~~chad~~
 Sodaguyz#4729: time for me to go to sleep
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: It's 11 am here. I just woke up lmao
 vanderrich#9982: a movie from pixar and disney iirc
 Sodaguyz#4729: it's a brisk 5:00 AM for me :))
 DrNukeLear#2414: Good to hear
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: *the ceiling*
 Sodaguyz#4729: hey what's up?
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Better, did a lot of talking yesterday.
 DrNukeLear#2414: Morning! How’re you doing?
 SandyTrollin'#0001: You too
 SandyTrollin'#0001: Thanks
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Good luck!
 SandyTrollin'#0001: And thanks to you too!
 SandyTrollin'#0001: Thanks
 SandyTrollin'#0001: Okay
 SandyTrollin'#0001: Oh, olay
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: There will be, but it won't be announced until the very start of the jam
 SandyTrollin'#0001: Hey, it’s the first jam i join. Is there a topic?
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: *rolls in* hello :D
 vanderrich#9982: :dogekek: (no nitro moment)
 vanderrich#9982: :o chief why are you a sortof mod in almost all game dev related servers im in lmao
 theChief#0001: or in this case, potato
 theChief#0001: another face I recognize 😉
 vanderrich#9982: hi
 BadPiggy#5202: I'm neither
 Pixstatic#3464: I’m definitely the former; I hate vegetables
 Yollie#2239: I always think I’m the former but in reality I’m the latter
 Sandra#4621: i mean yep that sounds about right
 Pixstatic#3464: everyone here is either really smart or high
 Sandra#4621: tbh I wouldn't remember my primary school teacher's first names that well I barely remember their surnames 😛
 dardasaba#9759: Over here, some teachers act kinda like parents in a way, and they (usually) don't act as if they're superior or more important than their pupils
 dardasaba#9759: I mean, when I finished middle school I went back to my elementary school to say hello to my teachers and they all got excited that I came to visit and stuff, and I definitely did not go "good to see you again, ms ___" xD
 Sandra#4621: its just the nature of the student-teacher relationship to have that professional distance I think.
 dardasaba#9759: 🤷‍♂️
 Sandra#4621: but I'd still do so as "mr something" or "ms something"
 Yollie#2239: Say the teachers username online
 Sandra#4621: yeah I definitely would say hi to a teacher if I encountered them in the street
 dardasaba#9759: I mean, over here if you recognize your teacher in the street you say hi :P
Feels weird to me that at some schools teachers are like "you called me by my name???! HOW DARE YOU"
 Sandra#4621: but I mean most of my teachers were pretty chill too, that is the australian public school way 😛 (I went to a special australian public school, it was academically selective, but it was still technically a public school)
 PepperBoi#4544: lol same for me but I live in American
 Sandra#4621: I mean you don't say the teacher's first name but you *always* say their surname
 Sandra#4621: yeah I mean so did I.
 Yollie#2239: I go to Australian public school so everyone there is super ultra chill and they don’t care that much
 dardasaba#9759: Huh?! xD
Over here, the teachers get annoyed if we **don't** call them by their name, for example if someone goes "teacher, can I ask a question?" Or something, the teacher's like "my name isn't teacher, it's ___" :P
 PepperBoi#4544: I dont think my high school has a detention
 Sandra#4621: yeah I mean I don't think it was detention worthy (maybe if they were particularly strict) but it definitely wasn't a thing you did at all.
 Lawn#1538: That's detention waiting to happen haha
 Lawn#1538: Calling a teacher by their first name was a big no at my schools
 Yollie#2239: Remember their full name and call them by that every time
 Sandra#4621: its definitely inappropriately formal but its something I learned off other people at my school, they'd say it which let them get away with not saying their name
 Sandra#4621: yeah that's for sure
 Phallo#3476: in that scenario i think we would have just said "mister"
 Merus#7019: but it was always inappropriately formal
 Yollie#2239: Always works
 Yollie#2239: Lol I literally can’t remember the names of any teacher at my school so I just say “excuse me!” Instead
 Merus#7019: I don't think I called only of my teachers 'sir' but the option was definitely there
 Sandra#4621: you just say sir/miss and its fine, obviously.
 Sandra#4621: it was a great excuse for not remembering their name
 Sandra#4621: (and/or didn't remember the teacher's name)
 SlamBamActionman#7160: I can't fathom saying sir to your teachers
 Sandra#4621: i mean in school we'd say sir if we were being particularly suckuppy 😛
 Yollie#2239: Don’t worry sir I also feel uncomfortable
 Phallo#3476: im uncomfortable just thinking about it
 Yollie#2239: Call everyone sir
 Phallo#3476: imho "sir" is for the military and people over 55 only
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Don't worry, we won't call you sir
... gramps
 Lawn#1538: I'm still adjusting with being called 'sir' by customer service folks
 Sandra#4621: look I mean I'm using it in the adult senpai way where you started at the same job before me its totally normal 😛 obviously.
 PepperBoi#4544: I have a limited time for GMTK so I tried to see what I could make in a limited time
 Yollie#2239: Ayo poggers
 Merus#7019: there is an entire _generation_ under me for whom Final Fantasy X is an old game
 PepperBoi#4544: Yep lol
 Yollie#2239: ...mini jam?
 PepperBoi#4544: I just finished my practice jam game!
 Merus#7019: hi Slam: I'm older than you. It Gets Worse
 SlamBamActionman#7160: When I helped young students with math problems learn for the national exam, one of the ones I helped called me senpai when she learned I had watched some anime back in the day
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Oh god this brings back memories
 Merus#7019: JamBanActionman
 Merus#7019: anyway I suspect we're going to see Slam's evil alter-ego this jam
 Yollie#2239: They could probably drink straight lava and say it’s mild
 Yollie#2239: Naive, chief, you should realise that Korean people have like a 200% immunity to spice compared to everyone else
 Merus#7019: lol I can't believe Chief got _Korean double-spicy_ noodles and then was surprised how spicy they were
 theChief#0001: Yeah so I'm pretty sure the spice mix for those noodles is made with just those seeds  😂
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: we stan a Slam
 Sandra#4621: just *maybe*
 Sandra#4621: maybe I've been reading too much manga lately
 Sandra#4621: lol
 Sandra#4621: he's basically the second in command after mark here
 Sandra#4621: slam is the senpai of us mods too 😛 has easily been at it the longest.
 Yollie#2239: And then you see a Korean friend literally stuffing them in his mouth and being perfectly fine with it 💀
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yeah like why are the seeds,  the smallest and most easy to not see part, also the part that contains the fire of a thousand suns
 ConstantDerivative#6302: instant death
 Yollie#2239: When you get one of those Korean chilli things and then you accidentally bite on one of the tiny seeds 💀
 theChief#0001: But those?
Those noodles were assembled in the firey pits of hell
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: That's why he shuts down conversations if they get too... -puts on sunglasses- *spicy*
Yeeeeeeah, it's all coming together
 Yollie#2239: Muahahah I’m Asian I automatically can handle spicy food
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Close! I have but one weakness:
Injuries of any amount
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Slam's one secret weakness: seasoning
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: ^ yeah that's a good way to put it Constant
 SlamBamActionman#7160: I'm weak
 SlamBamActionman#7160: I usually say that I find creme fraiche too spicy
 ConstantDerivative#6302: i have extremely low spice tolerance but i still like spicy food
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I like the flavour of spicy food but I am SO BAD with fresh chili. It just knocks me about so much so anything that contains it is like 2 spice levels up from whatever its advertise as for me
 theChief#0001: 
 SlamBamActionman#7160: theChief hecking died
 theChief#0001: I'm not ashamed to say I wept like a little baby
 theChief#0001: This was ROUGH
I can handle a lot of heat, but this had me in actual tears
 SlamBamActionman#7160: (pls dont thx)
 SlamBamActionman#7160: "Oh I sure hope people don't change their names to Slam this year again oh noooo"
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I feel you, I got an Indian and it was so good but the dish I got had friend chili in it which I am kind of allergic to so it was SO tasty but for real... rough
 Teslobo#8274: Feigning that you don't like it
 SlamBamActionman#7160: This tradition needs to stop
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Wait me damn it we are like 3 days into the server being open and I'm already being hailed as an omnipotent god *this year again*
 SlamBamActionman#7160: I regret nothing
 Teslobo#8274: A grave of your own making
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Eventually the Slammening comes for us all
 theChief#0001: I think developing is actually _you_ with mark's voice synthesiser dubbing it
 SlamBamActionman#7160: You think you have it bad? I ate hot wings yesterday. I am paying the price.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Good night everyone!
 DrNukeLear#2414: You’re right. Definitely needed a puppet.
 Teslobo#8274: It's too early to be reading this
 SlamBamActionman#7160: The Developing series was a step up in production
 DrNukeLear#2414: Why would he need a puppet? Mark is just a voice on some B-roll.
 SlamBamActionman#7160: That's a Patreon inside joke
 SlamBamActionman#7160: I press a button and Mark says a word
Still having some issues with words like "fifteenth" though
 SlamBamActionman#7160: I got myself one of those AI voice synthesizers
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: > Unless you went to a very specific event in Malmö like 3 years ago
that was recon for the puppet specs
 addiment#3628: Hi, I'm slam, from Slam Bammer's Toolkit
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: GMTK Game Jam, no more.
It is now the SlamBamActionJam.
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Unless you went to a very specific event in Malmö like 3 years ago
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: ^ facts
 SlamBamActionman#7160: You've never seen me and Mark in the same room is all I'm saying
 theChief#0001: It's all just AI
 Intuwing#6389: uh oh
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Slam is the true power source of GMTK. He secretly replaced Mark for a replica puppet years ago
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Good
 addiment#3628: I fear no man. But that... *thing...*
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: ||its because you scare me ||
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: lol sorry
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Well now I feel that was an anticlimactic message
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Tomfoolery has been banned, now only permitting Jimdumbing
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I keep seeing "Slam is typing" popping up for longer and longer each time and I feel like the jaws theme should be playing 😄
 addiment#3628: ||But don't fool with minors||
 RedTeapot#1960: I want to hijack the conversation like the mods here sometimes do but I have no topic
 Teslobo#8274: Minor tomfoolery
 addiment#3628: no excessive amounts
 addiment#3628: only a little bit of trolling
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: that's cool, believe it or not we're actually quite happy to joke and stuff, we just want it to happen in the right places so that important or serious stuff isn't drowned out, or so that things don't get out of hand to a point that is unreasonable or becomes offensive etc etc
 addiment#3628: I'm just fooling around, thanks again for the advice though
 addiment#3628: darn
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: hype is for nonsense and random stuff, general is for conversation. More or less. I mean if yo prefer I can just tell you all to stop completely, I thought this was a reasonable compromise
 addiment#3628: thus making it specifically general
 RedTeapot#1960: This is _game jam_ general, not general general apparently
 addiment#3628: and where memes don't go apparently
 addiment#3628: an arbitrary limiter assigned to words
 addiment#3628: a figment of our imagination
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Seems like a very non-hype thing to chat about in hype
 addiment#3628: But what is "general," truly? 🤔
 RedTeapot#1960: Kek
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I feel like the chat about what swears can and can't be said should be in the hype channel if it's going to be a thing and not in general
 addiment#3628: i blame discord
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: It really is, apparently. Wow.
 Yollie#2239: See if you rearrange the order of the words, you can use dumbass instead
 theChief#0001: To add to this, send it to people early! Basically exposure therapy 😉
 addiment#3628: this fella (ironically, of course)
 Yollie#2239: Who were you calling an a**hat?
 addiment#3628: i guess a**hat was too much
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Lol
 addiment#3628: fuck
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: fuck
 Yollie#2239: Actually a cool tip for art in particular I like to use is stick to a huge brush and never go to a smaller brush
 addiment#3628: wait, did swears get blocked?
 Lawn#1538: More or less ^
 Yollie#2239: “It’s good enough...”
 addiment#3628: just gotta apply it...
 Lawn#1538: Set a time limit. If you go over the alloted time, move on to the next task.
 addiment#3628: I read that, that was good
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I mean there's a full time management breakdown post pinned at the top is that any good 😛
 addiment#3628: but seriously thanks
 tykenn#8548: My tip is to check out previous game jams and sample the submission list randomly (instead of playing just the best of the best). Then it becomes clear how low the bar actually is when you only have a couple days to make something
 addiment#3628: now this is advice
 Micro (ig - musoukasan )#4281: It's a skill. First is identify that you're doing it. Then the why: Ex: if it sucks, means I suck/I'll be embarassed/I know I could have done better...
All of those are Context + Expectation. Change either one of those intentionally and you freed yourself from it.
The problem is people usually let the thoughts run free in a loop without identifying. You gotta intentionally put it back on track
 addiment#3628: damn, this isn't helpful at all! like 2 words??? send more /j
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: here you go ^^ (forgot to reply the post to you)
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Use the planning time to come up with a time scale. Set how long you want to assign for planning, producing, and polishing (setting aside sleep/eat and at least 4 hours for exporting the game).
Take your idea and split it into Essential  and Desirable (it would be great to have but is not absolutely necessary) and then prioritise each list
Start at the beginning of the essentials list and get the first item working, then move to the next task.
As you start running out of time cross things off the bottom of the desirable list.
When you come to the end of your assigned production phase then you finish the task you are on and you stop, no matter what state the game is in.
You then move on to plishing phase, you DO NOT ADD anything new to the game in terms of code, mechanics, nothing. You might improve art or fix a code bug but you do not add naything new in the polish pahse. Whatever you got done is what you got done.
Use the lists, the time you set aside, and the amount of stuff you crossed off to learn something about your time management skills and try to improve next time
 addiment#3628: I am a better game developer now
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Gotta trust your gut.
 addiment#3628: thanks m8
 addiment#3628: good advice, any specifics on how to do that?
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Once it's functional and in the project, leave it alone and move on to the next task.
 addiment#3628: will keep in mind ig
 addiment#3628: I am my own worst enemy :(
 addiment#3628: Does anyone here rn have any tips they'd like to share for avoiding perfectionism traps during game jams (and development in general)?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: we shoudl start talking about games like pizza
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: lol
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: What kind of toppings does your game have?
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Does you game have seasoning on it?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I just call it game feel... like the first thing everyone says is "juice means game feel" so like, if you have to kee saying what it means just call it game feel in the first place lol
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I call it at 7pm
 BadPiggy#5202: I just call it " oomph "
 Tex B.#4484: Gotsta have me juice
 tykenn#8548: I love the word "juice" to describe game feel *because* it reminds me too much of "moist"
 Tex B.#4484: Game feel is too corporate and vague for my blood
 Tex B.#4484: It is usually called hitstop yeah
 BadPiggy#5202: Pretty sure it's called hitstop
I remember it being mentioned about the old god of war games
 Tex B.#4484: Hahaha
 Toucan#3289: (Am I the only one who just does not like the word "juice" to describe game feel? It reminds me too much of "moist")
 theChief#0001: Freeze frames also work 😂 but yeah I quite like juice frames xD
 Pixstatic#3464: juice frames is better
 Pixstatic#3464: Ah
 theChief#0001: Hitstop
 Pixstatic#3464: I know they have a name that isn’t “juice frames” but I forgot it so I’m not going to say it
 BadPiggy#5202: Oof. Vlambeer games are one of the few which get extreme shake right lol
 RedTeapot#1960: Might turn the PC off as well
 Pixstatic#3464: don’t care what game I make, I’m adding that feature
 Merus#7019: _Vlambeer has entered the chat_
 Pixstatic#3464: I’m going to add a setting for infinite juice frames that just pauses the game whenever something happens
 BadPiggy#5202: People usually think more screenshake = better game feel lol
That's definitely not the case
Look up a video of Sifu and look closely, there's a beautiful minimal amount of camerashake and zoom for every hit. You may not notice it but it adds so much to every hit and never gets disorientating
 Yollie#2239: But yes I agree
 Yollie#2239: Ok tbf you’ve done like 120+ jams so that sample size is huge
 Pixstatic#3464: may as well just open the pause menu every time I hit an enemy - I want infinite juice frames
 Yollie#2239: Though once I went overboard with juice and that game felt really bad to play because of how much there was lol
 Pixstatic#3464: juice frames are essential
 BadPiggy#5202: Of course. Just that particle effects can take a while to actually get right
 Yollie#2239: Yeah it’s a lot about the camera and sfx, but also stuff like lighting and nice particles and those slowdown frames and stuff
 theChief#0001: Delayed response sorry, but I never use more than 50% of the available time and I've won jams 😂 it's all about time management and scope
 Pixstatic#3464: my version of polish is custom level transitions and shaders and shit that add nothing lolll
 Tex B.#4484: I'd love a jam split between a 48 hour core idea jam, and then later a week long polish jam
 BadPiggy#5202: This lol
 Pixstatic#3464: some jam games are so polished it makes me angry
 BadPiggy#5202: You can have tons of juice only using your camera tbh. You don't need particle effects all over the place kek
 Yollie#2239: Polish is like half the game ngl
 Alphons6#5054: Did a long Jane for once and worked on Cave Buster if anybody has heard of it. It was pretty fun to have a lot of time to make something awesome
 Pixstatic#3464: yeah but you’ll get a less polished beatemup with a mechanic you’ve never seen before that feels *awesome*
 Toucan#3289: I like longer jams because I'd not need to crunch for it. A week is nice for me.
 Yollie#2239: No bad piggy please no
 Yollie#2239: You need longer jams to do more ambitious stuff like that
 BadPiggy#5202: Then go 2.5D
It gives the same feeling and in a short time kek
 Yollie#2239: Shorter jams are cool but they can’t quench the feeling of “I want to make a really polished 3d beatemup with cool lighting and lots of juice”
 RedTeapot#1960: Hmm... I found out that I can't work on a game for more than a couple days, so maybe there's that. With my last week long jam I ended up doing almost the entire game in the last 7 hours lol
 BadPiggy#5202: Everyone ends up making arena horde type games based around a certain mechanic lol
I'm all for it though cus I love these types of games
 Yollie#2239: Pain
 Pixstatic#3464: I feel like the shorter jams are better because they have to be really mechanically strong since there isn’t time for making tons of levels
 Toucan#3289: Meanwhile, my first jam failed because our programmer gave up halfway and ghosted lol.
 BadPiggy#5202: Not really tbh. Everyone crunches towards the end either way lol
 Yollie#2239: Surprisingly no, I don’t think having less time affects jam results much
 tykenn#8548: I've been in month long jams though, and usually the games end up so long that fewer people play them anyway
 Pixstatic#3464: with a whole week you feel like you have lots of time that you don’t actually have ig
 RedTeapot#1960: It might be a bit unfair because someone will have all five days and someone won't
 BadPiggy#5202: Because you end up scoping much smaller and making more tight design choices
 Pixstatic#3464: it’s cus you’re putting aside a whole weekend with no breaks and *just jamming*
 Yollie#2239: My first jam was scorespace and you know I wouldn’t say the game I made for it was *that* bad
 ConstantDerivative#6302: oh
 Scratch#4814: It's kinda ironic how one can get a more functional game in 48 hours than 1 or even 2 week jams
 Yollie#2239: Yes
 Pixstatic#3464: first one I did was a wowie jam lol my entry to that sucked
 BadPiggy#5202: Yup
 RedTeapot#1960: Yeah, I've taken part in two ludum dare jams with a friend and didn't like it back then. After some years I tried doing GMTK alone-ish and it went well
 Toucan#3289: There's no rule that one **must** use all the days of a jam, of course. Nothing wrong with finishing earlier.
 ConstantDerivative#6302: wait the brackeys jam still exists?
 BadPiggy#5202: The first jam I ever did was GMTK 2019 and I made the worst game ever for it lol
 tykenn#8548: week long jams are nice if you keep expectations the same and just take more breaks
 Yollie#2239: Tbh I’m a big fan of longer jams since you can do some real ambitious stuff with them
 BadPiggy#5202: 3 to 5 days max is like the right amount for a jam
 Toucan#3289: Yes, the first couple jams you do, before you meet people, before you've teammates you can call on, before you know what you're doing, are really rough.
 Pixstatic#3464: yes psychologically have a *whole week* messes you up
 Yollie#2239: He overscoped, didn’t manage to finish on time
 Yollie#2239: Just have a massive ego it always works 👍
 BadPiggy#5202: This right here is one thing I love about jams though lol
 Pixstatic#3464: a week is too long for a jam tbf, I failed that one. Just can’t let it get you down
 BadPiggy#5202: There's that as well.
If you had a bad experience in a jam, that will definitely put you down and leave a bad taste for jams in general
 Pixstatic#3464: it’s like christmas but santa is whipping you telling you to make a video game to spec - but you get hundreds of little games for free afterwards so your labour was worth it
 Yollie#2239: He tried brackeys jam 2022.1, failed, and now he against jamming
 SlothHugger-v2.0#3202: And all my friends are in business field, doing god knows what.
 SlothHugger-v2.0#3202: this is my first game jam ever cuz I got recently rejected from Activision as their SWE intern lol, and i talked to someone in recruitment and they asked me to participate alot in game jams and shit and try to build my CV
 Toucan#3289: I've a couple artist and musician friends that refuse to join jams for that reason.
 Alphons6#5054: ^ . ^
 Toucan#3289: ^
 SlothHugger-v2.0#3202: ^
 BadPiggy#5202: I love jams, but I can understand why someone would hate them lol
The stress to make something good and tightly designed in a short time can sometimes be a little much for some and maybe not fun for others
 Toucan#3289: "Holiday" is not how I'd describe it personally, lol.
 Scratch#4814: GMTK is like a devs best holiday in my eyes
 ConstantDerivative#6302: who the hell hates game jams, especially gmtk
 Pixstatic#3464: definitely helps to set up proper source control in advance because unity collaborate likes to break mid jam and that’s never fun
 ConstantDerivative#6302: bro wth-
 Viola_Buddy#6763: Maybe next year though! We'll see
 Yollie#2239: The only game dev friend I have hates jams for some reason 😭
 Pixstatic#3464: I don’t want to start the jam early and all my preparation is pretty much out the window when the theme is announced but I can’t help myself
 Viola_Buddy#6763: Working with like-minded strangers sounds pretty cool, but I can't do that this year for sure because I can't commit at all to anything because my schedule over the critical weekend is a bit AAAAAAA due to other lifestuff.
 Toucan#3289: Ah, I'd misread, sorry. I thought you **didn't** want to start eearly.
 Scratch#4814: My favorite tactic is Constructive criticism
 theChief#0001: Same, I stopped counting after my 100th jam and that was a couple of years ago 😂
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: there are plenty of game jams for everything with focuses on all different stuff, so there's definitely opportunities to try new things
 Pixstatic#3464: it’s mostly because I’m excited. I enjoy game jams more than christmas
 theChief#0001: I often find friends more difficult to deal with, you care more about their feelings (or rather, I do 😉), so I tend not to speak up if they've done something dumb or we're going in a direction I really don't like
 Yollie#2239: I like working with musicians since it’s easy and simple, just ask for music and you receive, it’s a great win win situation
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: exactly, this is why there are teams of like 12 people that succeed, because the lead is very clear about how everything should work and what everyone's role is
 Toucan#3289: Oh, you'll not need to start that early. Simply talking to them some days ahead is enough.
 ConstantDerivative#6302: i hate group projects with strangers so i just team with friends
 Pixstatic#3464: what you said sounds like hell
 Pixstatic#3464: oh god lol I start plotting logistics months in advance to distribute work fairly
 Toucan#3289: Yes, this. I've usually had good experiences in teams because we chat before it starts. Investing time with the people on your team is the key to success 🙂
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: absolutely, and if you're not used to it then it will be really different but thats ok. You might find up sides and down sides to it
 theChief#0001: When you're working in a team, communication is the biggest skill
 Viola_Buddy#6763: I will be a jack of some trades and then just kind of stub in the rest of it.
 theChief#0001: I think the biggest thing to be aware of is team dynamic - toucan just beat me to it 😂 you've gotta be up front about expectations
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: if the first time you talk to your team is jam day then something's gone wrong
 Scratch#4814: I hope to eventually try solo, build up my skills as a eventual jack of all trades
 Toucan#3289: I mean, even if you find somebody in the teamfinder, you should always talk to them before the jam starts. And find somebody else if you're not a fit for each other.
 Pixstatic#3464: solo jams are harder to stay accountable imo
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: ^ that's super common
 theChief#0001: I've had great experiences in a team, and awful experiences 😂
 Pixstatic#3464: this’ll be my third time doing the gmtk jam with a friend, it’s our yearly ritual now
 RedTeapot#1960: I went with people found on this Discord server for two GMTK jams for music and it went great (there was no team finder back then). YMMV though
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: you beat me 😛
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I would recommend everyone tries a game jam solo and a game jam with a team at some point because they are very different experiences, in the same way I recommend everyone try and 48 hour jam but also a 1-week jam.
The way you approach everything is so differentt hat it's really good for learning and developing different types of skills
 theChief#0001: It's definitely a different experience! I'd recommend trying it some time. I tend to prefer working alone, but often find someone to do music because it's so important
 Viola_Buddy#6763: I can never bring myself to trust myself to be committed enough to working on a team with internet people for things like this
 Pixstatic#3464: still awesome tool, we’re leading game jam innovation here guys
 Pixstatic#3464: totally, I’m just paranoid
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: to each their own
 Pixstatic#3464: I can never bring myself to trust internet people to participate in sacred gmtk game jam traditions with me
 theChief#0001: It's a great tool, much better than posting on some random discord channel and hoping
 theChief#0001: I found someone to do music within about an hour on it 😂
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: consentual sliding is fine
 Scratch#4814: right, consented sliding
 Pixstatic#3464: very nice tool to have in a jam, even if I won’t use it myself
 Pixstatic#3464: there’s many people on the team finder by the looks of it
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Finding someone through teamfinder and using the official team finder to reach out to someone who consented by also joining the teamfinder is not the same thing as randomly DMing someone without asking
 Alphons6#5054: Mb it’s better than before I guess
 Alphons6#5054: Oh cool
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: If you are looking for a team then the Team Finder is the tool to use, there is plenty fo space to link and art station portfolio etc. That's the tool you get
 Scratch#4814: were they wrong though? that's how the team finder works
 Alphons6#5054: Sorry
 theChief#0001: It's enough for everyone else! That's what we provide in this server
 Pixstatic#3464: with the scope of jam games it tends to be harder to integrate premade code than it is to just write it in the jam time
 Yollie#2239: Threaten them
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: No
 Alphons6#5054: It isn’t enough
 Pixstatic#3464: realistically I don’t think you can get very far in a jam without having someone doing *most* of the code
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: if you are looking for a team use the teamfinder ^
 Yollie#2239: 
 Merus#7019: 
 Alphons6#5054: How do I advertise myself for the jam, I’m an artist
 Viola_Buddy#6763: There should be one if you use *only* premade code, and no other custom code to connect the pieces /s
 Yollie#2239: OMw to make a new skin for an old game
 theChief#0001: That said, you shouldn't be writing code specifically for the jam before it starts. _that_ tends to be pretty obvious lol
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: there will be a channels for streams and discords etc when the jam starts
 Pixstatic#3464: I usually pre make some code to save me time and then do something totally different when the theme is announced
 theChief#0001: Nobody is going to be able to tell if code is premade, and slotting code into your jam game comes with a lot of extra baggage 😂
 Yollie#2239: Freesound.org my beloved
 Pixstatic#3464: I make liberal use of my adobe stock licenses during this jam lol
 ConstantDerivative#6302: bfxr is great for generating sfx
 Sandra#4621: it definitely is
 Pixstatic#3464: integrating sound effects is difficult
 Sandra#4621: this is true for all the assets but especially true for the sound effects
 Sandra#4621: its how you use the sound effects, not whether you made them yourself or not, and how you use them is always down to your implementation
 Alphons6#5054: Can I advertise myself anywhere?
 Yollie#2239: There’s not one for code? 😳
 Viola_Buddy#6763: That sounds like it could be the basis of some sort of whimsical game, actually. Especially if the art style is that the entire art is made of words.
 Alphons6#5054: Hi
 Pixstatic#3464: sound design is hard even if you find sfx online because they rarely fit purpose
 Sandra#4621: its one for music specifically excluding sound effects according to the rules.
 Sandra#4621: its fun 😛
 Pixstatic#3464: I think it’s just one for “music and sound” or similar
 Sandra#4621: I mean feel free
 Viola_Buddy#6763: ~~I will record myself saying "boing" and "land" and "whack" and use those as sound effects for my platformer.~~
 Sandra#4621: there's one for graphics and one for music but the rules don't seem to indicate there being one for sound effects unless I misread the rules.
 Toucan#3289: The left side, obviously 😉
 Pixstatic#3464: there is one
 Yollie#2239: YOOOOOOOOOO POGGERS
 Sandra#4621: there's not even a checkbox for sound effects from my understanding so... don't bother making those yourself during the jam unless you want to
 Pixstatic#3464: yeah totally I’m just a horrid art supremacist
 Yollie#2239: I find it easy to tell if someone’s using premade art assets but yeah I think I’d have more chance identifying the side the twix came from than figuring out if the sound effects were premade
 Scratch#4814: if someone uses outside assets, I personally will rate them more heavily on composition rather than the art itself, getting good assets is one thing, making them work well together is another
 Toucan#3289: Honestly, it can be pretty hard to identify if something was made with assets, if they've not used popular assets, and match the styles together. We just need to trust people crediting them properly.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: there's a pinned post here and in the art/sound/tech rooms that has links for people to find resources as we are talking about assets etc
 Yollie#2239: At least it’s better than seeing a bug and thinking it’s an emote 💀
 theChief#0001: Hey do you want some synty I've got lots of synty for you
 Pixstatic#3464: oh noo
 Toucan#3289: Oh god, I'd seen that emote from the corner of my eye and thought a bug was crawling across my phone LOL.
 Pixstatic#3464: I’m very biased towards things built with assets that aren’t from like the front page of the UAS lol
 Pixstatic#3464: and it shows on the page so it definitely affects ratings (or my ratings of other games at least)
 Sandra#4621: yeah exactly
 theChief#0001: Yup, that's right - ludum dare is incredibly strict. I like it in a way, but I prefer being able to reuse my old code. Rewriting everything just for the sake of "doing everything during the jam" is pain xD
 Intuwing#6389: thats mostly for teams
 Sandra#4621: but it won't affect the main category that matters.
 Sandra#4621: but you have a checkbox that you can tick if most of the assets were made within the window so you can get that extra credit for bonus categories
 Intuwing#6389: i agree
 Pixstatic#3464: it’s better this way - if I had to make all my own music for games it would waste so much time oml
 Intuwing#6389: yeah maybe its ludum that doesn't allow them
 Sandra#4621: yeah premade assets have *always* been allowed
 theChief#0001: At damn it I was beaten to it by a teapot 
 theChief#0001: (also the rules haven't changed, it has always been "whatever you have the license to use")
 Intuwing#6389: ok maybe i confused something, maybe its ludum that does this
 RedTeapot#1960: I think premade assets were always allowed, you just need to mark that you used premade stuff
 Toucan#3289: It's easier on solo devs, too.
 Intuwing#6389: ok i got it
 Pixstatic#3464: the challenge is creating a game not being a one-man studio
 theChief#0001: It's a game design challenge, not a programming/art/sound challenge!
 Pixstatic#3464: because some people are bad at making assets and would prefer to use licensed assets instead
 Intuwing#6389: also why isn't the jam your assets only this year
 ConstantDerivative#6302: y e s .
 Intuwing#6389: ah yes, fellow smallant watcher
 ConstantDerivative#6302: sometimes people do that to do some insane glitches, like literally teleport cappy
 Viola_Buddy#6763: Oh yeah, that would do it. And similarly I think the world record 2P home run contest in Smash was (at least at one point) one person playing on two controllers. Well, and also Sakurai doing just that in one of the Sakurai Presents for the Smash 5 DLC
 Intuwing#6389: ah, those are probably speedrunners
 ConstantDerivative#6302: oh god
 Sandra#4621: yeah exactly.
 Intuwing#6389: its more like your attacks become p2
 Sandra#4621: but mario odyssey in 1p mode doesn't really have the whole "one person controlling two characters" vibe
 Sandra#4621: so that definitely has that vibe
 Sandra#4621: I have seen people play mario odyssey 2-player solo and doing co-op with themselves
 tykenn#8548: Would probably be too much work for a jam, but I've thought about making a game with indirect multiplayer. Like you still play it alone, and you don't see other players in game, but some of your actions could slightly affect the experience for others in subtle ways
 Intuwing#6389: you can play as a hat 😛
 ConstantDerivative#6302: wait wha
 Viola_Buddy#6763: Oh, I've never played Mario Odyssey 2-player. I'm under the impression that that's also more "assist mode" (like 2p Mario Galaxy where the second player can shoot star bits to help out the main player) than truly feeling like one player playing two characters.
 jermrellum#5051: I mean speedrunners play multiple mega man games with 1 controller so probably
 ConstantDerivative#6302: i wonder if anyone has successfully done that
 Intuwing#6389: my fav example of  this is SMO (although its more like traditional 2p mode)
 jermrellum#5051: Trying to play overcooked with one controller controlling both cooks simultaneously was kind of impossible for my brain
 Sandra#4621: (I know I certainly would play the original ds version of twewy co-op because gosh that game is too complicated
 BadPiggy#5202: GMTK made me play downwell
 Intuwing#6389: priority is important
 Viola_Buddy#6763: (I... haven't actually played Brothers. But I have heard about it. ...On GMTK.)
 Intuwing#6389: yeah
 theChief#0001: But that's like, right at the end if everything else is sorted 😂
 theChief#0001: I'd like to add local co-op to mine as an option, it should be pretty easy to do drop in with unity's new input system
 Viola_Buddy#6763: I was thinking Brothers, yeah
 Sandra#4621: yeah like the world ends with you!
 Intuwing#6389: like Brothers the tale of two sons?
 BadPiggy#5202: Too many games of that type now lol
 jermrellum#5051: there were a few games that were massive multiplayer -- stuff like when the player died their body could be used by other players as a bridge to reach the goal
 Viola_Buddy#6763: Or maybe it's the kind of game where you control two characters (say, one with the mouse and one with the keyboard), and you could have two players controlling them separately or one person multitasking.
 theChief#0001: Ah 😂
 Sandra#4621: > You can not require the user to have hardware beyond a keyboard and mouse (so no VR games, webcam games, and no controller-only games).
you can't submit VR games
 Intuwing#6389: yes that
 theChief#0001: Yep, requiring local coop is like requiring vr 😅 you can do it, and I'm sure the game would be interesting, but you're limiting the number of people who can play
 Sandra#4621: or you could do solo-local co-op
 Intuwing#6389: unless loc coop is like an option
 Intuwing#6389: so your game gets far less total ratings
 theChief#0001: Yeah generally you want to put all of your best content in the first 5 minutes!
 Intuwing#6389: except many ratees dont have friends to loc coop with
 Sandra#4621: I don't remember the name of it but I remember quite liking it last year
 Sandra#4621: yeah, it definitely can be. I was impressed that that particular game did it in the first place
 Viola_Buddy#6763: A local multiplayer game doesn't seem so bad, and I think some entries were in previous years (I think Joined Together was a good year for local coop? I haven't actually participated before this year so this was all just something I was sitting on the sidelines for so I might be misremembering). But yeah, dealing with online in 2 days sounds like a nightmare.
 tykenn#8548: Most people play jam games back to back by themselves, playing for maybe 5 minutes and moving on. So the games with the most plays/feedback are usually the ones that accommodate that
 ConstantDerivative#6302: and also there is the thing about implementing multiplayer
 theChief#0001: Not against the rules, but you definitely limit the number of people who can play!
 Sandra#4621: its not against the rules!
 Yollie#2239: Kinda common sense but making a multiplayer game for a 2 day jam is kinda really hard lol
 Yollie#2239: I’ve made an online game for one of the mini jams but it wasn’t exactly great
 Yollie#2239: Not to this jam, but I’m dying to make some kind of online game for multiplayer jam
 ConstantDerivative#6302: its not a good idea to submit online multiplayer games into a game jam, right?
 Sandra#4621: I mean I *have* seen a game use an external server since it was a multiplayer one before, but obviously it is important that you don't update it during the judging period.
 RedTeapot#1960: That might allow circumventing Itch upload block during the jam so I wouldn't risk it
 Yollie#2239: There was also embedded scratch stuff you could use but idk if you can put that on itch
 ConstantDerivative#6302: oh
 Yollie#2239: Dunno about the newest scratch version since I never used it but in scratch 2.0 you could export things with a super roundabout way
 Sandra#4621: yeah I seem to recall there's some way to export scratch stuff to itch? might be wrong and I might be misremembering.
 Viola_Buddy#6763: For me, Flash/ActionScript was a really good place to learn from because there's such an immediate connection between the code and what you visually see on screen. To be fair, I'm not familiar enough with modern game engines and their languages - I presume they would be similar nowadays. But at least, compared to general-use programming languages like Python, everything is already setup to be connected to the screen, rather than only being able to print to the command line unless you use some external library. It's why I like JavaScript even nowadays, even with all its flaws, because it has a native built-in connection to the HTML elements which are very much visual.
 ConstantDerivative#6302: werent they supposed to submit it in itch??
 Yollie#2239: Chads
 Sandra#4621: I might be wrong
 theChief#0001: Ah no, it was fine - though because I learned before YouTube was a thing, I taught myself and didn't know you could use multiple different scripts - I would end up with whole games in one file that I'd never be able to update because they were _thousands_ of lines long with no structure or anything 😂 ultimate spaghetti code
 Sandra#4621: I seem to remember there have been one or two gmtk jam entries made in scratch I think?
 ConstantDerivative#6302: yeye
 Yollie#2239: Wait he makes vids?
 ConstantDerivative#6302: oh yeah griffpatch, he still makes vids i think
 Yollie#2239: There was a really popular guy called griffpatch or something who made insane stuff because he was really good at programming and had a programming job irl
 Sandra#4621: with a visual scripting language
 Sandra#4621: scratch is a game engine yeah
 Yollie#2239: Yeah I guess so, it’s basically javascript iirc
 Werewolf#5455: Thankyou 😭
 ConstantDerivative#6302: does scratch count as a game engine? its like both programming language(?) and game engine right
 Viola_Buddy#6763: Ah, I thought you meant it promoted bad game design/programming habits, especially since the conversation turned to Unity doing the same thing except not actually because it just made it more accessible.
 theChief#0001: Yep exactly! I think it's a great thing that unity helped make game dev so approachable 😁 more game devs = more great games
 Werewolf#5455: Thanks! 🥲
 RedTeapot#1960: Good luck with the exams though
 theChief#0001: The security stuff, basically it was VERY easy to use it maliciously
 Yollie#2239: Am I the only one who started with scratch? 😭
 Werewolf#5455: I feel so sad this year because i wont be able to participate in the jam. My exams begin the same day as the jam 😭😭
 ConstantDerivative#6302: if a tool is easily accessible to others, some people are definitely gonna use it poorly
 Viola_Buddy#6763: Oh Flash! I started with Flash too! What was bad about Flash? Or do you mean the security stuff which I never understood (because it shut down before I learned any  programming in a non-self-taught way), which as I understand was the reason it was shut down?
 theChief#0001: Like everything else, it's a tool - unity doesn't make bad games, new devs make bad games and Google play and steam make it too easy for "my first game" to be put in front of millions of people 😂
 Yollie#2239: Every time you open the game you need to sit through a minute of nothing but unity splash screens
 Yollie#2239: Embrace it like a chad, add a few more unity splash screens to the start
 theChief#0001: It's an interesting consequence for sure! But I don't know that it's a bad _business_ decision, there are a lot of people I know that pay for unity plus even though they earn less than $200,000/year just to avoid that stigma!
 RedTeapot#1960: I think if they haven't removed it, the benefits outweigh the costs, even if it kinda backfires a bit
 theChief#0001: My unity games never have the splash enabled 😉
 ConstantDerivative#6302: just realized how bad that is for unity
 Yollie#2239:  👁️
 theChief#0001: I once had someone try to argue that unity physics is inherently bad and can only ever make bad games. Their reason was that it was closed-source, and that _they personally_ had never played a unity game with good physics
Unity uses physx, which is both open source and used in a LOT of games lmfao
 tykenn#8548: Just what happens when the only games that show the logo are the ones without the budget to have it removed
 RedTeapot#1960: Also asset flips with Unity splash screen flooding Google Play
 theChief#0001: There are some "gamers" who will make a lot of noise if they see a unity splash screen. There are also a bunch of game devs who like to think they know a lot of stuff, but actually know very little, that do the same
 RedTeapot#1960: I mean, my programming obsession has started with Flash
 theChief#0001: I really enjoyed working with it - but the security vulnerabilities made it totally unfit for purpose xD
 ConstantDerivative#6302: yeah
 Yollie#2239: There’s people who hate unity?
 ConstantDerivative#6302: same with unity, its too good that its easy to make bad games, thats why some people hate unity
 tykenn#8548: oh I agree it was pretty bad, but it was so easy to make bad games with
 theChief#0001: Flash was baaaaaaadddd
And I say that as someone who learned game development by making flash games lol
 tykenn#8548: I miss the flash era. That's what got me started making games.
 RedTeapot#1960: I think we've almost come full circle. There was Flash for browser games, it even got a hardware-accelerated 3D API. Now we have another virtual machine running in the browser (Wasm) with some 3D capabilities. Hopefully it doesn't end up where Flash did
 Yollie#2239: Whenever I export now I pray for no bugs and if there’s bugs I just don’t do webgl 😛
 RedTeapot#1960: Also, GC in Wasm might help a bit. And getting rid of JS wrappers for all imported functions in Wasm (like WebGL calls)
 Phallo#3476: for people that dont know... WebGPU is a standardized web abstraction layer for DirectX 12, Apple Metal, and Vulkan
 Phallo#3476: i cant wait until WebGPU is a real thing... it should fix all of these issues and you should be able to have way more complex games running in the browser
 theChief#0001: Yeah it's unity's half-assed WebGL export that sucks 😂 technically possible, definitely not advisable 😉
Tried doing some stuff in Unity, found it extremely finicky
 theChief#0001: A bunch of streamers played it too 😭
 Phallo#3476: *feels pain for you*
 theChief#0001: This sort of thing happens nearly every time I build for web, so I usually just don't now
 theChief#0001: I once made a fast paced precision platformer for ludum dare, exported to WebGL and ran through with my sound off.
There was a bug with the audio for jumping, it made a really high pitched squeak at max volume -_- you had to jump _hundreds_ of times! I put a bunch of effort into the soundtrack, I was so disappointed
I fixed the bug after the jam - took me 16 straight hours of googling, I just needed to add some silence to the end of the audio clip
 Sandra#4621: oof
 Phallo#3476: one of my games used a bunch of realtime lights. in unity it supports 8 lights at a time... webgl only supports 3 lights. I spent like 2 days of my 2 week jam time trying to figure out why my lights were violently flashing
 theChief#0001: It's not as much of a requirement as everyone thinks. My usual advice is build once and give it a big run through. Spend an hour max looking into any issues you find, and if you're happy with it then stick with the web version
 Viola_Buddy#6763: Woah, this looks super helpful. Not that I'll be following it so closely because I definitely have other stuff I need to be doing that weekend so I'll have to really truncate all of the stages by a lot, but it gives an outline *to* truncate.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Godot 4.1 will have web exports again
 theChief#0001: I actually had a game in the top 10 most rated without a WebGL build 😂
 Sandra#4621: that's fair I suppose. web is kinda like that.
 IntangibleMatter#2281: But it should be back when OpenGL gets reimplemented
 IntangibleMatter#2281: Because of the Vulkan overhaul they have no web export in the default build of Godot 4!
 theChief#0001: It does make it easier to play, sure, but in my experience it always causes more issues. I've done over 100 jams and I've never had an issue with getting enough people to play 😂
WebGL bugs always drag my score down because they're such a nightmare to diagnose and fix
 Phallo#3476: i just export to webgl, cross my fingers, and the cry when it inevitably has a bug that can only be reproduced in the browser
 IntangibleMatter#2281: At least until 4.0 :/
 Sandra#4621: though you do want to make sure it actually works
 Sandra#4621: gets a lot more eyes on it
 Sandra#4621: exporting to webgl makes it so much easier to play your game though
 theChief#0001: Unity WebGL is terrible
 theChief#0001: Oh fair, I never export to WebGL anyway because it always takes so long and causes so many issues 😂
 Azurezero#4851: so far i've only made 17 levels out of 63 for my puzzle game, but of those only 3 are actually puzzling
 tykenn#8548: Having a quit button doesn't make sense for a browser game. If you have some of the other settings, then yeah, a menu could be nice. But if it's just a play button, that doesn't always have to be an entire new scene.
 theChief#0001: Credits and volume control are also nice to have, yeah
 RedTeapot#1960: I used main menu for some credits and volume control. And the polished feel, yes
 Phallo#3476: "but my game autoplays and crashes when gameplay is over" *proud smile*
 theChief#0001: One of the categories is "presentation" - that will absolutely factor in
 theChief#0001: Like I said, if you've got time it makes your game feel more complete and polished. If your players think it is complete and polished, they'll rank you higher
 theChief#0001: You want to provide a play button and a quit button - not because "all games have it" but because it's incredibly convenient for the user 😂
 Sandra#4621: tbh I really don't think a main menu is worth doing, myself
 Phallo#3476: so in theory with sleep and such... it is really a 10ish hour game jam 😛
 tykenn#8548: I dunno, it feels like sometimes jam games have a main menu just because that's a thing games are "supposed to have". It can be pretty important for a more time sensitive action game to check that the player is ready before starting, but if the game is going to wait for player input before doing something anyway, that main menu be unnecessary.
 IntangibleMatter#2281: Last year my game didn't actually have it's main mechanic working until 8.5 minutes before the end :p
 theChief#0001: Fair 😂 but my advice is always to make something you think you can finish in 20-30% of the time you have available
 Phallo#3476: in theory yes, in practice most people will make too big of a game 😛
 theChief#0001: Day 2 should be content, polish, testing and bugfixes
 theChief#0001: It shouldn't mean sacrificing gameplay, your gameplay should be done by the end of day 1 😉 if it's not, you've tried to make too big a game
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yoou get better at it as you practice
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: time management is as much a skill as coding or art etc
 Phallo#3476: they are mostly a waste of time because it would usually mean sacrificing more of the actual gameplay 😛
if you have additional time... 100% add a basic menu system
 theChief#0001: Also a quit button it's one line
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: absolutely, different teams will have different ways of dealing with things. Accessibility is very often a low priority for game jams- although as I ALWAYS say every year: if you have time to put in music then you have time to put in one toggle and 1 line of code that turns the music off.
Being able to mute games helps so many people out for so many ways please include it
 theChief#0001: Menus and things tend to make your game feel more complete and will DEFINITELY net you a higher score, but it's not all about your score 😉
 Phallo#3476: i totally agree... if the menus are not required for your game then they are a waste of time in a 48h game jam
 theChief#0001: And there are going to be things you have to skip out on
 theChief#0001: It's a 48h jam, there are going to be things that don't work properly 😂
 Roiboi#2055: i'll have to ask the rest of the team to see what they think, but thanks for the insight!
 tykenn#8548: I feel kind of weird saying this in a community that values accessibility, but I usually just skip pause and settings menus (or spend hardly any time one them), figuring they're not a priority for my 5 minute adventure. But I also skipped character faces in my last jam, so it's just shortcuts all around.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: learning is the whole point
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: But experiencing that has now taught you that issue and how to fix it. The answer isn't necessarily to do it ahead fo time, the answer might be to put in better time management where UI is more of a priority for example
 Roiboi#2055: regardless of where this case falls into, i plan to revisit previous game jams and try to improve them in preparation for this one. the only reason i wanted to know about this was because ignoring basic GUI until the last moment really screwed us over in one of the last game jams we did where a large part of the game we made was entirely unreachable because the button code was bugged.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: There's rules as written and there's the spirit of the jam. The mods have all clearly said we will not make edge case rulings that is not our job, we will point out when something straight up isn't ok.
Everyone has access to all of the rules which is the same information that we have.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: read the FAQ we can't make ruling son edge cases, you can decide what you feel is in the spirit of the jam. people have quoted the rules etc so how you take them is your choice. However making code to use in the jam specifically that doesn't belong to another is project is *explicitely* against the rules
 Phallo#3476: if you wanna feel better about your decision you could make a junk practice game to hone your skills over the next week and then create a new project and use the old one as reference for the game jam... im sure most people will be referencing old code during the jam
 Roiboi#2055: technically speaking it would count as "code for the game jam" although i fully intend to use it for other projects later on, i'm just incidentally making it now ~~not because of procrastination or anything~~
 Roiboi#2055: in terms of unity, i would try and make that into a package first
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Look, just remember, Escape is a good key for getting people out of the game
 Roiboi#2055: yeah basically
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Makes a game around the theme but then shoehorns shoot to move in the game
 Roiboi#2055: i mostly mean stuff like a main menu (that any game *would* have) with a button that takes the player to the actual game content. i have no intention to write code for any game mechanics because not only does that go against the spirit of the jam, it also defeats the entire purpose of joining.
creating basic functionality is purely out of convenience, and i *intend* to start doing that soon, although i really want to make sure this case doesn't fall into the "unfair advantage" category.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: correct
 Phallo#3476: basically dont write a shoot to move game and then shoehorn it to fit the theme
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Yeah we can't answer edge cases but yeah an EMPTY project means the project is empty. When the time starts if you need a pause menu then you can bring in previously written pause code for example.
You can't realisitcally know what your project will need untill you have designed it and you can't design it until you know the theme
 IntangibleMatter#2281: I'd use them for the jam but.... none of them are finished :,)
 IntangibleMatter#2281: Honestly I feel that. It's my third GMTK Jam, and I've spent the last month writing buttloads of tools so I can start on a bigger game this summer
 GameboyFunny101#0057: very helpful, I will try to make a schedule for this game jam so I wont go off track
 Merus#7019: this isn't a question we can realistically answer - the spirit of the rules are to not write code specifically for the jam before the jam starts
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: The good news is that I've learned a lot since then and I am just as ~~dumb~~ ready as I was before
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: You could just look and see if its already pinned maybe
 parks19#1135: some one pin this please
 Roiboi#2055: depends, the rules also say it's ok to use previous code and i've certainly made my fair share of menus in the past
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Would you say a pause menu and settings was an empty project?
 Roiboi#2055: hence the clarification
 ConstantDerivative#6302: not sure? it said on the website that it was okay to create an **empty** project
 Roiboi#2055: Is it alright to set up basic stuff that any game would use prior to the jam? (things like menus, pause, settings, etc.)
I'm *fairly* certain the answer is yes but I want to clarify.
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Well, I did that last year too...
 IntangibleMatter#2281: I remember you- Didn't you try to make a game with a custom engine during this jam a year or two ago?
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: I figured that moon was looking pretty close...
 ConstantDerivative#6302: okay
 Phallo#3476: just panic
 RedTeapot#1960: There will be a day in the first 24 hours
 ConstantDerivative#6302: what if there is no "Day 1" since the jam starts at 2 am for my time zone
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Morning Mark
 ConstantDerivative#6302: 1:22pm
 RedTeapot#1960: Yeah, timezones exist
 Phallo#3476: 1:22am
 Yollie#2239: 2pm
 Triggered#6897: 9:52, gm
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: its 10 PM here...
 BadPiggy#5202: F
 Phallo#3476: i really enjoy that you have said "pig" so many times that your autocorrect was all like "nah brah i got you"
 BadPiggy#5202: Oh look at that, Mark is online
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Hey, what's up?
 BadPiggy#5202: Yo, milkshake
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Someone buy me a cheesecake!!
 Sandra#4621: its pinned already
 BadPiggy#5202: Autocorrect lol
 RedTeapot#1960: I liked the previous version more
 BadPiggy#5202: Someone pin this

 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: **OBJECTION!**
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Alright move the emoji spam to  not in general thank you
 Roiboi#2055: of course once they find the evidence it can be used for...
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: For when things get *really* intense
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I like the trio
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: 😛
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I did say I was gonna write a thing
 Sandra#4621: linkmojis *are* definitely a strange beast 😛
 BadPiggy#5202: ***(cough)Mark loves Zelda(cough)***
 Roiboi#2055: don't know when link became the spokesperson for GMTK but i'm all for it
 BadPiggy#5202: This one is forever a mood
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Also got other new ones too!
 Triggered#6897: Could this be hint as of what the theme could be?
ON FIRE
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Yeah, it's new!
 Roiboi#2055: is that one new? i don't remember seeing it last year
 Scolon#4218: 🔥
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Roiboi!!!!
 Roiboi#2055: 🔥❤️‍🔥🔥
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637:  📱
 BadPiggy#5202: Time to smash my phone
 theChief#0001: Right I've found the code - give me a couple of hours piggy and I'll sort it 😂
 Sodaguyz#4729: ;-;
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Only orange names can use gifs. 😈
 BadPiggy#5202: Lol. Ultra-nightmare mode
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I just saw [question about using music] and was like [default mod answer here] 😄
 theChief#0001: 200bpm for TTFAF, that's going to be intense, I love it
 BadPiggy#5202: It's aight
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: oh sorry I missed the context of the question my bad
 BadPiggy#5202: No no lol. In his game
 theChief#0001: He meant for my audio synced flappy bird game 😂
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: you can use whatever assets you have the legal right to use
 ini denis#3052: the bot are pretty cool
 BadPiggy#5202: I meant locally available MP3 files lol
 ini denis#3052: wow
 Games Bot#9309: ini denis wants to organise a game of [**minecraft**] at  ()!
 theChief#0001: Oh that would be amazing
 BadPiggy#5202: Can I use my own music ?
If so, I'ma use " through the fire and the flames "
 theChief#0001: Exactly!
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: One of the best reasons to make a game: Spite.
 theChief#0001: I did it in about 6 hours because my brother said I wouldn't be able to 😉
 snuffysam#2767: if you're working with unity, one thing you should 100% set up before the jam starts is exporting in the right aspect ratio for itch, and the fullscreen options (or lack thereof)
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Imagine flappy bird. But, instead of flapping, its ||shoot to move.||
 BadPiggy#5202: No seriously, the flappy bird format could work wonders with new mechanics
 BadPiggy#5202: Or just make a variation of flappy bird
 Phallo#3476: I 100% agree, look up and test out all of the basics before the jam starts as it will save you a lot of headaches when the time really matters
 theChief#0001: Also, make something really little, probably follow a tutorial - something like brackeys top down shooter
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: in fact Imma write up a thing hold up lol
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: But yeah I would absolutely say open your chosen game engine, set up a project with just a block moving back and forth on the screen, export it out for windows/web/etc, make an itch.io page for the "game", launch the game on itch.
It will save you HOURS of stress and panic and pain to know how to do that stuff BEFORE the jam
 BadPiggy#5202: Trying a concept you've never done before in a jam with an engine your comfortable with, that's doable
 SpoopySkeleton#5885: agreed
 theChief#0001: Jams are super helpful for learning! So long as you don't go into it with particularly high expectations 😅
 BadPiggy#5202: Oof. I understand if people want to learn from scratch during a jam.....
But that honestly sounds like a trial by fire.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Usually they don't have absolutely no experience, but often there are people who use game jams to try out new tools for the first time, as it's a short focused amout of time to get to grips with it and really see what it can do
 SpoopySkeleton#5885: Anyone want to collab?
 tykenn#8548: I'm at a startup studio. I just started working there a couple months ago
 DFJames#5514: Anyone here a dev at a studio? I’m from Double Fine, it’s nice to meet everyone
 jermrellum#5051: my experience with unreal was being confused how to not make an arena for an fps
 Yollie#2239: yeah try godot or unity, unreal isnt really suited to beginners
 IntangibleMatter#2281: And honestly it's 100% worth it. GMTK Jam is my favourite weekend of the year
 IntangibleMatter#2281: Who says none beforehand? Try downloading an engine (I recommend Godot for beginners - godotengine.org) and getting some practice over the next week! You might not be able to make a really complex polished game during the jam, but you'll make something!
 wyrm_slayr#7477: I've seen some other youtubers do stuff like that
 jermrellum#5051: But I also imagine that he'd probably want to be doing stuff like answering people's question and other management things instead
 jermrellum#5051: I mean he could make a game during the jam but not have it be in the rankings or anything
 Phallo#3476: i mean... ive been in a few game jams before where the owner also participated... it was obviously just for fun and they would not be part of any prize if there was one
 Selviam#7268: ooo or blackthornprod too (also the name of a whole channel)
 snuffysam#2767: also, the answer is no, he isn't participating.
i can't think of any reputable game jam where the owner  gets to participate
if mark really wanted to participate in a game jam, there are plenty of other jams he could try out
 Phallo#3476: it is a whole youtube channel
 wyrm_slayr#7477: You could also maybe work with a coder if you're good at art or music
 Draconium🪁#9786: "brackeys" is the name of a tutorial ?
 Phallo#3476: Yes there are a lot of other roles that could be done other than programming... but if you also really want to learn how to program video games i would highly suggest looking into unity as a lot of really useful youtube videos (i recommend brackeys) on how to do this
it is not easy, but with some effort it is actually not as hard as it would seem
 wyrm_slayr#7477: I would try to learn the basics first (especially in a 48 hour jam), but you could try a basic engine or just make a really simple game.
 tykenn#8548: Depending on the genre/engine you could make a game with no coding at all
 Selviam#7268: well its no gaurantee its gonna be a full game probably just a few controls and sprites without UI is what my first was like
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: For me, yes
 Draconium🪁#9786: You're able to create a game in 48 hours with no experience with coding beforehand ??
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Same
 Selviam#7268: you could try to learn how to code during the jam thats what i usually do
 redka#6365: And send you to the moon with nothing but magnetism and the Unity game engine
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: You can still join if you dont know how to code. Art, design, music, playtesting. There are still other roles.
 redka#6365: He's going to put a magnet on you now
 Draconium🪁#9786: I wish I knew how to code it seems amazing to participate in a jam
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: ┬─┬ ノ( ゜-゜ノ)
 IntangibleMatter#2281: (   ._.          )
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
 redka#6365: You can remove the ping from the message but MARK STILL GOT PINGED
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Now it's just a ghost ping.
 Phallo#3476: dont worry guys they removed the ping 😛
 redka#6365: That still pinged
 redka#6365: You did not just
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Yo, why are you pinging Mark?
 IntangibleMatter#2281: Am I the only one wondering if Mark Brown will be participating in the jam this time with how much he's done on Untitled Magnet Game? Seems like he'd be more equipped to do a game this time
 Selviam#7268: a theme of just mayhem would be super fun
 CALSYTHE#6648: i have been spreading so much jam in the last week
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Well the join count is 15,000 right now
 snuffysam#2767: tbf, it's well-labeled in the discord server, which is the place you go to develop for game jams usually
it's kinda surprising how the teamfinder isn't linked on the main itch page though
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: 🤣
 jermrellum#5051: ah well you have to be proactive to know about teamfinder because it was announced on twitter but not youtube
 ShockingShots#6969: If this year goes like last year, my sign that the flood gates are open will be leaving work with 20+ discord messages from folks on the team finder 😝
That was genuinely one of the most pleasant surprises of the jam last year for me.
 ConstantDerivative#6302: yep
 ShockingShots#6969: One of the most interesting parts of each year's jam is watching the behavioral patterns on the discord server. Like how it starts out relatively quiet. Then a few days before the jam when Mark reminds people that the jam exists, the flood gates open until a few days after the jam's judging period starts.
 Sodaguyz#4729: iconic quote, I loved that movie
 Merus#7019: what in the sam hill
 ShockingShots#6969: Jamsson is my idol
 grong dong bongle#6426: i loved it when Game Jamsson said "It's game jammin time!" in the hit movie Game Jam
 ShockingShots#6969: Which will make it even more impressive when this year's game jam is even more gam jam than last year's game jam.
 Sodaguyz#4729: I drink mine by the gallon
 PepperBoi#4544: (This is theoretical game jam btw)
 𝔘𝔱𝔱𝔢𝔯𝔏𝔦𝔪𝔦𝔱#2948: Oh god
 PepperBoi#4544: I ate it so fast I choked
 𝔘𝔱𝔱𝔢𝔯𝔏𝔦𝔪𝔦𝔱#2948: Delicious?
 Sodaguyz#4729: ;-;
 PepperBoi#4544: I ate all my jam
 Sodaguyz#4729: it goes on toast
 Sodaguyz#4729: game jam
 PepperBoi#4544: Any sweat?
 Sodaguyz#4729: do you have any?
 Sodaguyz#4729: delicious 😋
 Scolon#4218: It takes like pure, unfiltered, sweat
 Sodaguyz#4729: probably sweat
 Sodaguyz#4729: what does game jam taste like?
 Sodaguyz#4729: you never know.....
 Scolon#4218: Eat the game jam 😋
 ConstantDerivative#6302: based on previos GMTK Game Jams, it is most probably that GMTK Game Jam 2022 will be one of the game jams
 Sodaguyz#4729: i don't know, it might not be 🤔
 𝔘𝔱𝔱𝔢𝔯𝔏𝔦𝔪𝔦𝔱#2948: 😆
 bagel03#7025: And like I said we’re still 5k short
 bagel03#7025: Yea
 ConstantDerivative#6302: same for 2020
 ConstantDerivative#6302: true
 bagel03#7025: Yea, but last year everyone was home from covid
 ConstantDerivative#6302: GMTK Game Jam 2022 will definitely be a game jam
 RocketCow#5210: One of the most jams ever
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Is gonna be one of the game Jams of all time.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: That this GMTK Game Jam
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I bet you
 wren#0640: we've had more than the previous year by the time the jam starts every year right
 bagel03#7025: No we’re still 5k short from last year
 bagel03#7025: Have we broken records yet?
 Draconium🪁#9786: The GMTK game jam 2022: A record breaking, server smashing, sleep schedule ruining, game making marathon
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: It's a good theme.
 lilburlap#8480: See you guys in 2 days with my 1-page rpg about not being able to do frontflips
 lilburlap#8480: That actually sounds like a fun thing to try making I'm definitely not making it digitally
 TheWizOfPants#5510: xD Yes!
 lilburlap#8480: Every time you need to figure out how to frontflip with your newly broken bones
 TheWizOfPants#5510: Make the game for the gamejam all about front lipping six times.
 Roiboi#2055: i didn't hear it from you
 lilburlap#8480: Frontflips are hard
 DrNukeLear#2414: Why?
 redka#6365: I will also cry
 redka#6365: If you called it I will do six frontflips consecutively
 RocketCow#5210: oh my god I know *exactly* what I'd do for that theme.
 DrNukeLear#2414: I would laugh if the actual theme was “Toolkit”
 redka#6365: That's the theme going forward, every jam
 redka#6365: The theme is actually Mark's catchphrase, "Videogames"
 TheWizOfPants#5510: Hello!
 Selviam#7268: Or the theme is just quite literally  “restrictive”
 Scolon#4218: Ah yes
 RocketCow#5210: my favourite light novel
 GameboyFunny101#0057: That Time I
Helped to Clear My Family’s Large Debt and Evaded
Foreclosure By Renovating My Family’s Old Run Down
Tea Shop That Was Struck by Lightning and Transported
Out of Nowhere to a Mystical Forest In Another World
During a Severe Thunderstorm, and Brewing and Serving
Magical Tea Made from Ingredients Gathered by Killing
Monsters and Foraging In Bushes as Well as Trees with
My Giant Spoon to Cute Anime Girls with the Help of
My Mother and Her Mysterious Teapot Shrines.
 wren#0640: actually a gamejam thats not one of those story driven specific game jams but has like, a premise as the prompt would be really cool i think
 RocketCow#5210: personally I'd leave out the mechanic part to really see what people can come up with
 RocketCow#5210: something like that, yeah
 DrNukeLear#2414: “Game with an elderly protagonist, no spiders, a horse named Jacob and fishing mechanics”?
 DrNukeLear#2414: “Two signature moves”?
 wren#0640: thatd be interesting actually
 RocketCow#5210: Somebody should do a "weirdly specific" game jam
 wren#0640: fuck yes
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: dont tell anyone but i have it on good authority that the theme this year is guiles theme from street fighter 2
 wren#0640: but honestly thats most gmtk themes theyre always quite good
 wren#0640: if it sticks with the early pattern of themes being based on videos with the recent development series i could see it being something really *non-*restrictive, prioritising personal creativity and design choices
 DrNukeLear#2414: No visible curves.
 wren#0640: make a game thats an retro movement based fps that takes place in quebec thats the theme
 wren#0640: imagine the themes just like completely restrictive
 Selviam#7268: Gmtk but the theme is McDonald’s
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: mcdonalds breakfast has jam
 DrNukeLear#2414: 😮
 Tsunami#0963: unless i bring it in
JAM IN THE MCDONALDS
 DrNukeLear#2414: Ain’t no Jam in McDonald’s.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: only patrons can post gifs
 Tsunami#0963: ma'am this is McDonalds
 redka#6365: Let us put aside our monads and boilerplates and recognize we need each other to *function*, *objectively* speaking
 redka#6365: OOP? Great for defining objects in a game environments and interacting between them, helps handle complex state logic, AI, and many other things FP falls short with
 redka#6365: FP? Great for mathematical problems, values that statically map to the same outputs and require no internal state
 redka#6365: It's not a skill to stick to one, it's a skill to recognize when you need to use another one
 redka#6365: FP is not arbitrarily better than OOP, both paradigms have good use cases, and bad use cases
 redka#6365: You can just change how things are passed in implementations
 redka#6365: Writing functions in a pure way makes refactoring easier, and makes it so that you never even have to look at the declaration again
 redka#6365: Internal state is good when you have to reference a value that changes over time, if your values work without those time changes, there's no reason to add internal state
 Merus#7019: Rose, I think it's because you're a patron, not where it's linked from
 RocketCow#5210: oh god, this is going to end in a paradigm slap fight, isn't it
 redka#6365: Oh no, my conditions for jumping have changed, and I have to refactor! If only there was an easier way, like a dedicated place in the function for this variable, like maybe in the.. parameters? No, that's too crazy
 redka#6365: Oh no, however will I get a velocity which is a 3D vector? Hm, I have to add arbitrary values onto the three axes, surely I can't just construct a Vector in a function and return it
 redka#6365: Honestly the amount of times you can solve a trivial problem with FP practices astounds me
 redka#6365: very fun to mess with, especially if you're not just an OOP numbnut and know some FP and DOP
 wren#0640: i need to try godot 3d more ive briefly messed with it but never got too in-depth
 redka#6365: Your gif is a hotlink, my gif is an image i have on my storage
 6746#9763: how come images are allowed but gifs arent? my beautiful dancing gif is better than any image in the world.
 RiverDog#8199: Ive been struggling with my tilemap and pixel art and now i now why haha
 RocketCow#5210: oh yeah I forgot that doesn't work
 DrNukeLear#2414: Can I send them marmalade as a prize?
 Scolon#4218: they're gonna win the jam
 wren#0640: good that they only have to wait a week :)
 wren#0640: they do NOT have a year to wait
 DrNukeLear#2414: They’re going to Jam the win.
 Merus#7019: I am a little concerned that they apparently don't have a year to wait
 RocketCow#5210: I believe in them
 wren#0640: they said it themselves i trust them
 null_ham#2050: theyre gonna the jam
 wren#0640: theyre gonna win the jam
 RocketCow#5210: that's a way to put it
 null_ham#2050: thats was an interesting interaction
 KokoBird#9800: and there they go
 PyxelGamesStudios#2803: Bye
 wren#0640: thats so cool man
 PyxelGamesStudios#2803: I AM Pixel Artist
 redka#6365: before we decided we want to make a platformer where you deal with time paradoxes
 redka#6365: Last year we concepted out a lifelink slasher, a detective puzzle game, and a few other paper concepts
 redka#6365: See what you and your team members enjoy, don't just go with first instinct
 redka#6365: Also, don't stick to a single idea! Get a bunch of micro-ideas, put them together in some basic software, cram in the 4 hours to see what actually is worth making
 PyxelGamesStudios#2803: I Should Win The JAm I Dont Have A Year To Wait
 redka#6365: Don't let the theme influence your genre, let the genre influence your theme
 redka#6365: Pre-emptively say "no shooters no matter the theme"
 redka#6365: A theme might sway you to make a shooter game, but your team sucks at shooters
 redka#6365: Outline what you have experience in, don't just do stuff because it "fits the theme"
 DrNukeLear#2414: Congratulations, the prize is Marmalade.
 redka#6365: Outline clearly what you can't do
 PyxelGamesStudios#2803: I Will WIN THE JAM!!!!!!!!
 redka#6365: One thing you should do is get your team members and talk about your limitations
 Scolon#4218: Happens pretty much everytime
 redka#6365: If you want any advice on making a jam game, just ask me
 Pixel#9717: I like to think I am too
 RocketCow#5210: I'm aiming for finishing a game, and if I make top 1000 I'll bust out the champagne.
 Scolon#4218: If you're worried about not finding a team, there will be tons of people panicking to find one like the day of/day before jam
 Pixel#9717: I've never made a game
 PyxelGamesStudios#2803: I Am Good Pixel Artist
 Scolon#4218: btw
 Pixel#9717: ngl maybe
 Scolon#4218: Try 
 bagel03#7025: Order 66 (nice job)
 redka#6365: Aiming for higher in 2022
 PyxelGamesStudios#2803: Did Some One Want To Make Game With me???
 redka#6365: 66th place in 2021
 redka#6365: (This isn't hust conjecture, this comes from a Honorable Mentions team member)
 bagel03#7025: So do 14 thousand other people
 Scolon#4218: Unless your game is just that bad
 bagel03#7025: Gl ig
 Scolon#4218: If you're adamant about doing this you will place really well 99% of the time
 bagel03#7025: ^^
 PyxelGamesStudios#2803: Want To Make A Game That Will Appear On GMKT Video
 redka#6365: People are more likely to look at your game if you show interest in theirs
 redka#6365: If you want a good chance to win, be nice, play people's games when they come out, rate as much stuff as you can, leave reviews
 PyxelGamesStudios#2803: I Am New Here
 Fupi#4400: hello
 bagel03#7025: Yea yea I get that and I appreciate it, sorry if I sounded mean I was kinda joking around
 PyxelGamesStudios#2803: Hi
 Fupi#4400: poor balls
 RocketCow#5210: okay hear me out: the spikes are *inside* the ball pit
 redka#6365: Inb4 someone makes a game with 3 spikes and a ball pit out of spite
 Fupi#4400: id play the hell of a Ball pit based precision platformer ngl
 RocketCow#5210: unless it's a *really good* ball pit
 redka#6365: Nobody will care that your character controls better than the one in Celeste if the gameplay is three spikes and a ball pit
 Pixel#9717: although if I have stuff then I just won't do it
 Pixel#9717: this would be my first game jam
 Scolon#4218: And yeah I always get really bored working on menus, so making sure to do that early
 redka#6365: Save yourself 3 hours of trying to handcraft the perfect character controller
 redka#6365: I think it's a good idea to practice that generic stuff every game has
 RocketCow#5210: THAT'S why it keeps crashing
 Scolon#4218: I want to make a roguelike this year so I've already done a lot of experimentation with randomness and procedural generation. Should be able to get it setup very quickly. Hopefully it isn't too hard to adapt the theme into that style of game
 DrNukeLear#2414:  This Stream architecture you mentioned has got me thinking. Definitely an interesting concept.
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: You forgot bubble gum...
 redka#6365: Those little things aren't the game, content is the game, and the content is something you can't have unless you have the core
 RocketCow#5210: if it's not held together by duct tape and dreams, is it really a jam game?
 3la2#3088: Welp I didn't work on a game for a year~ so this is gonna be kinda tough
 redka#6365: Hell, if you have a character controller you like, just rip out the code for it
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Right now I'm modifying my splash screen
 redka#6365: Get good at it, keep it fresh in your head
 redka#6365: Fun fact: You can practice doing generic game stuff that's not exciting, like character movement, interactions etc.
 3la2#3088: Will be announced when the jam starts in 5 days
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Shoot to move
 Pixel#9717: I just found out that the jam was happening
 Pixel#9717: ah
 Scolon#4218: Only mark knows and it's announced when the jam starts
 3la2#3088: oooooo
 Pixel#9717: what's the theme?
 RocketCow#5210: no, no, you have to *actively* waste people's time, that's the trick
 3la2#3088: A blank game will get points so it is pretty hard to get last place
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Just tell people not to vote for your game...
 Scolon#4218: Very nice button
 RocketCow#5210: That's a nice button
 Scolon#4218: Sure
 redka#6365: Anyone wanna see a cool button
 Scolon#4218: If you actually managed to get last place that'd be amazing
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: HA!! I'm aiming for 14,998
 DrNukeLear#2414: Yeah. I always rescale it to 64
 Sodaguyz#4729: I'm aiming for 14,999th place :D
 RiverDog#8199: Did you know, the default unit in Unity is 100 pixels... the more you know!🎊🤹‍♀️🍻
 RocketCow#5210: which is fair, imo. I'm indifferent on the matter. Sure, it can sting if that happens, but in the end it's not a big deal. It's not like there's 100s of youtubers salivating at the chance to flood the jam.
 bagel03#7025: Yea more than one game has made a full version after they are done and got a bunch of free sales
 Scolon#4218: I just like participating in game jams to document the game dev journey and the gained experience
 ShockingShots#6969: The satisfaction for me is a new portfolio piece and the equivalent of 1-3 months of game dev experience localized entirely to 48 hours.
 Tsunami#0963: Bruh i would be happy to just make a game
 Viola_Buddy#6763: ~~Maybe not satisfaction of *winning* but satisfaction nonetheless~~
 Viola_Buddy#6763: All right, I'm aiming for that sense of satisfaction
 Hobusu#5033: ~~The *real* reward, of course, is the friends you made along the way~~
 RocketCow#5210: which, to be fair, is an amount of exposure that is not to be underestimated.
 Hobusu#5033: The only reward is being featured in the video at the end of the Jam, yeah
 Scolon#4218: Other than a ton of publicity, but you'd get that anyways from being in the top
 Scolon#4218: afaik you don't get anything
 Sodaguyz#4729: the best prize of course
 Viola_Buddy#6763: You don't actually get anything from winning, right? Just a mention in the wrap-up video and a sense of satisfaction?
 bagel03#7025: It’s just kinda sucky any way you do something tho
 null_ham#2050: that is true
 bagel03#7025: But like I said, he only rates top 100 so while they may not win, other people are left out
 CC426#0243: Reminder that Cuphead was made in Unity
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: I *think* last year was the first year we introduced that, could be wrong though
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Yeah if your game is crap and you unscrupulously get it into the top 100, all that will happen is that mark will play it and realise it's bad, meaning it won't win anything
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Did we have the "rank x number of random games if you have not submitted" in 2020 btw?
 null_ham#2050: and polymars
 null_ham#2050: also vimlark and blackthornprod
 Hobusu#5033: That's also worth keeping in mind, yeah, even if something ends up in the #1 spot through player votes Mark still gets the final call on the actual winners
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Mark accounts for this as far as I know
 bagel03#7025: Well 101 was kicked out of contention
 Scolon#4218: I mean he didn't win though
 bagel03#7025: No shade but no where near as fun or as well made as some other top ones
 bagel03#7025: His vid came out I think 7 hours before the deadline, and was top 1 by the end
 null_ham#2050: oh yeah this was boosted to high heaven
 null_ham#2050: i cant find the page
 Scolon#4218: The page seems normal
 Scolon#4218: What happened?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Enlighten me
 bagel03#7025: Ideally yes I can tell there has been effort put into it, but did you see what happened with cell machine last year?
 birdstone#3073: oh hi moxxie
 SlamBamActionman#7160: We have ways to detect fraudulent voting, but I won't go into detail on *that* 😛
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Not many of course. But you can't just jump to your favorite streamer's game and give it 5 stars asap
 null_ham#2050: isnt it possible to just rate everything else poorly
 bagel03#7025: But how many people do you think that watch those vids (including myself) participated
 SlamBamActionman#7160: I forget the number but it's pretty big, 20+ iirc
 SlamBamActionman#7160: For example, anyone who has not submitted a game to the jam is required to play and vote on a certain number of games decided on random before they get to choose what game to vote
 bagel03#7025: But more people seeing your game = more ratings
 bagel03#7025: Ig the ratings from randoms
 null_ham#2050: like what
 bagel03#7025: They only go so far tho
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Actually we have things in place to prevent just that
 bagel03#7025: But yea this kinda sucks and there’s no way around it
 bagel03#7025: But like no stress excuse for pizza with friends is the best part
 bagel03#7025: Fair
 Techno#1832: There are so many PJP people here
 bagel03#7025: ~~cell machine~~
 bagel03#7025: Seems like a job more than a jam tbh
 null_ham#2050: also it kinda sucks that people with an audience before the jam can just call on their fans to upvote their game and instantly win :/
 bagel03#7025: (No shade btw to whoever made it)
 SlamBamActionman#7160: One of our Patrons run a 10 person team this year
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Nah sometimes we get big sizes
 bagel03#7025: Cuz I thought some game last year had like 14 people who made it and it was suspiciously large for a jam game
 SlamBamActionman#7160: If something with the site seems broken, tag @ Team Finder Tech Support and describe your issue! We'll get to it asap 🙂
 bagel03#7025: Is that sarcastic?
 Scolon#4218: Don't think that ever happened in gmtk lol
 bagel03#7025: “Free: you over scope”
 bagel03#7025: “Game made by 24 people who have been preparing for 6 months building piles of assets wins”
 bagel03#7025: “Mid game shoots to the top bc creator (who has subs on yt) posted devlog 8 hours before deadline”
 snuffysam#2767: that could be fun, i feel like there are a lot of common tropes in game jam games
idk if i could list them off though
 bagel03#7025: Someone should make a game jam bingo
 birdstone#3073: oh hey aren't you the person that made post jam productions?
 ZEST#7932: 2d pixel artist here if anyone needs
 Squishy Turtle#3988: Hooo boy
 Kira#7896: And making sure your team's source control works *before* the jam! That's a mistake one only makes once haha.
 LEB#3729: You can follow the instructions in the channel.
 LEB#3729: You need to log in at the top
 BravoDS (Music/SFX)#0694: http://teamfinder.gmtkgamejam.com/
 null_ham#2050: what
 PyxelGamesStudios#2803: Doesnt Work
 PyxelGamesStudios#2803: Thanks!
 LEB#3729: 
 PyxelGamesStudios#2803: Need Team!
 redka#6365: Decide what genre you feel comfortable in, decide the aesthetics, decide the basic design architecture, as long as you're not building content or mechanics ideas it should be fine
 redka#6365: And what your priorities should be
 redka#6365: Will give you a better idea of what your teammates are capable of
 redka#6365: Do a bunch of rapid prototyping on a few random micro-games
 redka#6365: If you already have teams and you haven't had experience together yet
 Tsunami#0963: you know it mr chad
 Sodaguyz#4729: AYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Yes... We here you!! Hello!!
 Sodaguyz#4729: hi
 Y - S H E R B O#9393: ello
 Y - S H E R B O#9393: anyone here
 Y - S H E R B O#9393: AYYYYYY
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Good night!!
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: now it's midnight here, imma disappear and get some sleep in. Cya!
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: It's funny, someone was like how do you use paint for pixelart and I was like well... i'm used to it. XD
 Viola_Buddy#6763: Ah okay. Must've missed that one. The way that "What can I make my game in?" was phrased (and the fact that itch itself has paper and pencil game uploads as a category) led me to conclude otherwise but that sounds pretty clear.
Also yes I'm over there in SoME2 too; hi!
 Reemus#7953: Europe-masterrace
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: europe time here, I should sleep soon
 GameboyFunny101#0057: 👍
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Me
 Sodaguyz#4729: wassup
 GameboyFunny101#0057: anybody here that is not in europe time?
 Sodaguyz#4729: agreed, nice job
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Thanks. But you should thank Paint 3D and graphics gale. *yes I use paint to pixelart XD*
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: You do a good job man 👍
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Well then. That is my pixelart ability.
 Tsunami#0963: not minding, just spinin'
 Sodaguyz#4729: yessss
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: In the rules under what can I make my game in it states
> You must produce a digital computer game, that runs on Windows - or web browsers supported by Windows. You can support additional platforms  if you like, but a Windows / browser build is necessary.
Also, are you in SoME2 I feel like I recognize your pfp
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: *this just. got out of hand and I do not mind.*
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: I suppose so, I'm ready for some craziness in my DMs
 Kira#7896: Sure.
 Tsunami#0963: always bro
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: *rolls into your dm's*
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: a spinning gif, just more chaoss XD nah it's just another word for spin
 DrNukeLear#2414: Sure. What’s a speeen though?
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Hey I know this is off topic but anyone wanna see a speeen gif I made of two characters?
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Think of ideas, list down those ideas, go with the one that sounds like the most fun and the most feasible to make with in a time span of 2 days (mostly for programing and prototyping), and just relax and have fun
 Dragonite#5414: You mean plan during the jam? If so trello is your friend
 parks19#1135: Yeah I agree. Thanks
 parks19#1135: Ok, thanks
 Kira#7896: Scope size small. Test often. Upload early. And remember to have fun. That's what jams are for.
 Kira#7896: Sometimes I like to look at the what I made when I started doing something. It's hard to see the slow learning. But the difference between the first thing and the most recent thing can be surprising, when you're actually looking at it.
 Tsunami#0963: i heard game desing docs are good, i dont know if they fir gamejams
its my first one too
 parks19#1135: Hey, I am a looking to know what is the best way to plan a game for the game jam. This is my first game jam and me and my friend are participating (We use Unreal Engine).
 DrNukeLear#2414: Likewise.
 Tsunami#0963: i almos alt f4 from living last year
but its better not to so i didnt
10/10 would live another life if i got the option
edit: sorry i thought we are sharing and caring
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: It's the opposite direction for me
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Been improving the last three years, tho I somehow am better drawing big than small XD
 Kira#7896: Believe me, a lot of people in this server are probably feeling the same way. Impostor syndrome is rough, but it's very common and you're not alone.
 DrNukeLear#2414: We’re all on journeys to discover our talents. I’m a better coder than I was 12 months ago. Keep drawing you’ll get there.
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Thanking random strangers that i'm still alive today :3
 Sodaguyz#4729: nah I'm rooting for you! believe in yourself!!!
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Because they can be
 Tsunami#0963: deal with it
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: *why are people so nice?*
 Kira#7896: ^
 Tsunami#0963: well i believe in you so you need to believe in you
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: eh I just have a hard time believing in myself.
 Kira#7896: Nah don't sell yourself short. I'm sure your art is great!
 Tsunami#0963: not really related, but can anyone recommend any videos on designing a 3d rpg hero? would really help
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Not that my art is that great. haha but yeah I saw today when looking through the teamfinder
 Kira#7896: Pixel artists are always in demand in jams too. If you decide to join a team you won't have trouble finding one.
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: God i'm tired. Why is it almost midnight again-
 snuffysam#2767: yeah! i'm sure we'd all over pixelart fanart of our games (:
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: And if all else fails i'll just pixelart some GMTK fan art to keep me busy :3
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I can always, how much I say I suck at it, use my limited renpy and pygame experience.
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I appreciate the effort but it's fine. There is always a next time when I got my mental health back in order.
 Kira#7896: I know Unity has packages for paper and pencil style games. All menus and drag and drop. Requiring little to no coding.
 Viola_Buddy#6763: And it sounds like they have other plans for now but it may become relevant later if those fall through.
 snuffysam#2767: there are plenty of engines you can use that release a file to be played on windows or browser, and require little to no coding experience
 Viola_Buddy#6763: Mainly trying to think of ways for Emily to be able to participate without needing too much coding experience, so it's not really something relevant to me personally.
 Kira#7896: Glad to have you here. It's a good community. I lik it here too.
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: (also nice pfp I love Blaziken :D)
 Hobusu#5033: If you want that rule to be clarified I can bring it up with the mods, but I think this a bit of a "come on" situation
 snuffysam#2767: it also doesn't "run" does it?
 Viola_Buddy#6763: Though I guess paper and pencil is "additional hardware"
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: **throws art in renpy** your wish is my command! :3
 Viola_Buddy#6763: Well, it says it must be available as a file on a Windows computer.
> What can I make my game in? Anything, provided you can upload a file that runs on Windows or browsers, and doesn't require any additional hardware or software.
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Been trying to take care of myself for the past schoolyear and that didn't ended up working out that well, i'm taking that week to think about stuff, mabye create some art idk. Anyways i'm glad I ended up here :)
 Hobusu#5033: The rules state that it must be a game that can be run on a Windows computer
 Viola_Buddy#6763: Oh, in fact, reading over the itch page, nothing actually specifies "video game," only "game." Someone more official might have to confirm, but maybe you could just upload instructions to a paper-and-pencil game or a game to be played when printed out.
 Kira#7896: Yeah, take care of yourself first, that's more important. There's still a week to decide what you want to do.
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Mhm, I could do that, mabye i'll see if I can find the guy I dm'd for team stuff and see if I could join, mabye as back up artist or something. Thanks for the suggestion tho! :D
 Viola_Buddy#6763: I see... Worst comes to worst you can do pixel art at the same time as the GMTK game jam is happening, with the same sort of time restrictions, even if it never ends up actually on any project? But that might feel a bit weird - I doubt you'd be able to submit art alone.
You could also do something like Where's Waldo, which is a game comprised completely of a static image, or something similar, depending on what the theme is.
 Azurezero#4851: today i coded an important mechanic i'll need for the 3rd part of my stealth puzzle game; cars
they stay off screen for n turns, then sweep the entire screen in one go, so you need something blocking the view between you and the road that turn
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I was originally going to find a team because I can't code, I wanted to just do some dumb pixelart as help.
 Viola_Buddy#6763: And if you do it yourself you won't have to bother other people
 Viola_Buddy#6763: Are you able to try to do it by yourself? That's what I'm doing because I am likely to need to drop out for IRL reasons
 BlenderStudent#4251: I am planning to make a YouTube game jam devlog
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I'm funny enough not stressing about the jam or final product, i'm stressing about my stupid mental health which is a wrech again and I don't wanna bother people with it.
 unityAccount#7810: You shouldn't stress over the final product. Probably a bit cliché, but what is important is that you learn stuff and have fun.
Even if you were to make an awesome game and win the jam you wouldn't get much more than if you didn't win. The experience is what matters.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: There;s no pressure for you to join but I would rather join and not manage to finish everything than completely miss out. If you're thinking about joining then join, it doesn't have to be a hands on participation
 Jeker#3389: I like some of thr features like, classes, namespaces, constructors, templates and even smart pointers to an extend
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: finishing a game is great but even if you don't you're going to learn a lot
 DrNukeLear#2414: I dropped out of the last three jams because my life was too busy, there’s no shame in it.  I finished my first three.
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I just am going through some heavy mental issues and I do not know if I am able to help out a team, combined with my not that great (personally) pixelart skills I do not want to let people down and working alone is scared in my opinion.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: if you want to then do it
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: That sounds like you have a cool plan. So prepared jesus. Awesome *here I am debating wether to even join lmao*
 DrNukeLear#2414: That sounds awesome.
 redka#6365: To test this we decided to reverse-enginneer the first three Portal chambers using the Stream classes
 redka#6365: The Stream itself is not impressive, but what we can do with it is
 redka#6365: Basically, what if we abstract away puzzles to boolean logic connectors
 redka#6365: We're testing a design concept we called a Stream
 redka#6365: We also plan to use the general architecture
 DrNukeLear#2414: Good idea. I’m looking at doing the same this week.
 redka#6365: Because let's be honest, nobody will be impressed with how good your character controller is if the game has no content
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: oh neat!
 redka#6365: We want to figure how the generic stuff works now, and focus on content during the jam
 redka#6365: My team is doing a test game to get to know each other and to practice some design and code
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: that;s already been responded to
 Lolsebca#6116: perfectly perfect
 Lolsebca#6116: pin it we gotta pin it
 DrNukeLear#2414: And thanks!
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: already done my dude
 DrNukeLear#2414: Any chance of a pin?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: **Game Jam Resources**
2D Art Assets:
2D Art Creation:
3D Art Assets:
3D Art Creation:
Sound:
Other:
Remember ALWAYS check the licence of any tools or assets you use as you may  have to include that in the game information. Free does not mean you can use it without consequence
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: nope
 WebiYT#1230: The topic of the jam isnt out yet right?
 StormyMay#4100: I'm about to be speedrunning refining pixel art skills before this weekend lmao
 DrNukeLear#2414: Far superior to rejection by dad joke 😉
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: A lot of what language you use is determined by the tools that you use, especially the engine
 Shimp#0064: I am planning to get into c++ someday, but im not at that point of dedication and work ethic yet
 thefatkazachus#2461: I prefer c++, but it's all personal preference ig
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: Also I'm a noobie I can't make a random generated dungeon game in 2 days
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Yeah because you won't be using that idea for the jam as its pre-done, so I would totally look at it as using the jam as practice putting together like 1 level of a game which will teach you loads and it'll be smoother to take on the other idea and get a full prototype done even faster with everything you've learned
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: Well I also just started unity and c# is with unity why should I learn another language that I'm not gonna use?
 Jeker#3389: Java is much easier than C++
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: You thing this is pain
Then I will make you do something
Learn Java and make a game on it
 Shimp#0064: I am scared of c++, i was trying to learn it, but was too young, now i just enjoy c# for unity and chill
 Jeker#3389: C is straight up better imo
 Jeker#3389: The most pain was using C++ lol
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: didn't thought that way but yes I could do some sketches and think how my prototype shall be then after (or before) the jam I start it
 Jeker#3389: It wasent, really
 Shimp#0064: Particle system mostly
 Shimp#0064: That sounds like pain
 Jeker#3389: Oh lol, well i made a particle system, a level "editor" a character controller and physics
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Greeted by a dad joke... Nice...
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: I have a daily programming thing on Monday and I don't have time on Sunday and I also want to not overdo using the pc before the 2-day marathon
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Oh ok so like the jam game can be a practice before you start this bigger project then? That's awesome
 Shimp#0064: I remember trying to make whole jrpg on it when i was like 15. I don't think i need to explain that i didn't get too far, and quit after making basic map system, random encounters, stats and battle system lol
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: Um I don't think I will start it before the jam
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Ok just checking lol. Give it a go, see if you can put down on paper how you want it to work all the mechanics etc then see about coding it. See how much you get done before you have to put it aside for the game jam
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: (are those too many stuff for a thought??? Lol)
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: It's gonna be a procedural generated zelda-style pixel art top-down dungeon game
 Jeker#3389: I've used it before, made an engine in it, wont use it for the jam tho
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: in general
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: For the jam? Or just in general
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: I'm stuck in a game idea but haven't yet started it
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: guys just checked Mark's video about prototypes and it will really help me
 Shimp#0064: Kind of a random question: does anyone use sfml c++ library here? Just for personal statistics
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Anyone who wants to join the game jam should join. There's a pinned post about how you don't need lots of art or music or code skills to make a game and even if you don't finish you will learn a lot in the process.
There is also more than one way to be part of a game jam and to participate in it. People who don't have time to make a game but who still want to participate can do so in many ways:
help people find an idea; throw around ideas to everyone or help one person narrow down their vision
give encouragement to people
hang out in the art/tech/sound help channel and give advice
playtest games and give feedback
Just because you don't make a game does not mean that you can't be involved in the game jam
 BadPiggy#5202: Frankly, even Unity isn't too easy to run either ( newer versions anyway, older versions are kinda fine )
If your computer is a true potato, your only option left is Godot
 DrNukeLear#2414: Very much not the case.
 Dr. Nemesis#6728: Was hyped for this jam but just found out that I have to work those two days. Due to circumstances I couldn’t book time off for it and can’t trade shifts. Welp there’s always next year. Good luck everyone!
 DrNukeLear#2414: Greetings back.
 Superchocolatemilkshake#6138: Hello, I'm back!!
 Lolsebca#6116: godot
 Crostzard#7475: then what do you use?
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I'll read this tommorow when hopefully my head is in a better place and i'm not trying to *bleep* myself. Thanks for the offer, i'll try to look after myself and idk. make some pixelart so I don't feel like crap.
 Reemus#7953: But I guess you are using other engines.
 Reemus#7953: Is unreal easier to run than unity?
 Lolsebca#6116: since my laptop can't even run it lol
 Lolsebca#6116: I hope note, if it's Unity I give up instantly
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: this is my first jam I'm excited
 Reemus#7953: Yeah not the best background in the world, right now, lost a team (it went defunct and without motivation) recently.
 DrNukeLear#2414: If you want to stay involved I was planning to do the event solo. You’re more than welcome to tag along on the development journey. If you see something you want to try and help with you’re more than welcome, no commitment necessary. Even if you just want to occasionally drop into Voice chat you’re more than welcome. Either way look after yourself.
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: I wish everyone the best of luck, I have decided, due to some mental health reasons, that I won't be participating in the jam, mabye i'll give it a go next year. GMTK walked along my path of game developing and i'm Mark grateful for that. Take good care of yourselves everyone. i'll see those awesome games featured on the channel. <3
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: The Team Finder works in both directions - you can make a post as an individual or as a team, so there's plenty of posts for both. You can make a post saying "Hi, I'm a writer", look at other posts where they're looking for writers, or both!
 Jeker#3389: eh, i'd say you be better off scratching from start for something like this
 Jeker#3389: Oh
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: yeah but you would be able to add components and visual scripting
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: not a 2 day job tho
 Jeker#3389: a level editor is different from an engine
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: I started doing it for a game I made (figured out quickly that it wasn't worth it to make a level editor like that)
 Astral#7476: Oh, that sounds pretty hard
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: if the theme is unity then I'm making a game engine inside a game engine
 goSciu#6587: \> theme is unity
\> just do whatever in Unity and you're done
 Reemus#7953: Maybe something about unity and survival?
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: theme predictions anyone?
 snuffysam#2767: fair enough, though it is a pretty fast engine to learn all things considered
 Reemus#7953: 🙏 Thanks! I would have to spend time learning Twine, which is not something I both want to do and can, got my job tasks in the meantime.
 snuffysam#2767: Games in Twine are proper games, I've seen some games with really cool & unique gameplay using Twine (you'd be surprised how much you can do with just "choose your own adventure mechanics")
But yes, of course if you want a team you should do everything you can to find one
 Reemus#7953: I invested too much in team buffs.
 Reemus#7953: Also going in alone is just too lonely for me, I am a "party animal".
 Reemus#7953: The thing is, I would rather help someone make a proper game, rather than just do something in Twine. I want it to be creative and reflect the theme and stuff. A proper team effort, so to say.
 Reemus#7953:  Hey sorry a question right off the bat - in the team finder, I should look and answer other posts if I want to join a team as an individual, not create a post saying "hello I am a writer looking for a complete team"?
 snuffysam#2767: Not necessarily! There are engines you can do as only a game designer/narrative designer!
Look up Twine if you haven't - there's a lot of cool stuff you can make in it.
Of course, use the teamfinder to find a team if you really want one, but even if you can't find a team, there are other options for participating!
 Reemus#7953: In any case have fun and hope to see a lot of strong, innovative games!
 Reemus#7953: Greetings everyone! I am thinking whether I should enroll or not into this jam, but I will need a team as I am just a game/narrative designer.
 Astral#7476: I am starting to realise, I really like pixel art! ^-^
 Nectar#2888: will do once you accept friend req
 Nectar#2888: totally understand, thank you!
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Yeah I feel like this is a DMs situation, reviewing/giving feedback on non jam related games isn't really the purpose of this channel and from experience if we let one person post their game, suddenly EVERYONE posts stuff they want looked at
 DrNukeLear#2414: If not drop me a DM
 Nectar#2888: hey, am i allowed to post a link to a game ive been working on to get some feedback and advice? I wanna hone some skills before the jam and would love to get some feedback on this demo ive made
 eMChe#3779: Hi everyone)
Glad to be here and can't wait to start
Also it will be my first 48h jam, I only participated in 72h ones
 download.jpg#9532: it wasn't phenomenal gameplay but seeing those new kind of ideas was just really cool to me
 download.jpg#9532: a woman with bat wings who could separate at the torso?
 download.jpg#9532: one of my favorite games from last year was based off of a mythological creature from the phillipines i think
 DrNukeLear#2414: For any developer from a culture not often represented in games.
I’d love to see more cultures represented in games accurately and respectfully.
African, Asian, South American or Native American stories featuring characters of that culture by developers from that culture would be amazing.
We see lots of knights, mafia, samurai, ninja, vikings, western influenced sci-fi. If you can bring something new to the table it can only be a good thing.
 Cyan "CyF" Flower#8543: thanks!
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Grats!
 Cyan "CyF" Flower#8543: Team success!
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Good here aswell, excited for the game jam. Looking through the team finder rn
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: Good, you?
 DrNukeLear#2414: Pretty good. You?
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: How's everyone doing today?
 lum#6016: Oh
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: black and white jam is it's own series of jams
 lum#6016: Cuz I can't think of a jam prompt limiting graphical style
 lum#6016: Was this theme used in a past game jam?
 Yollie#2239: Nah it literally means there must be only 2 colours the entire game, you can have more than that but the more colours you have the lower score you get in the black and white category of voting
 DrNukeLear#2414: Actually wouldn’t “Black and White” allow you to do a full colour game as long as the you use a Black and White mechanic?
 theChief#0001: That's reasonable yeah
 Yollie#2239: Oh right another thing I find dumb, making a gradient will rank you 1 star since a gradient is infinite colours
 Yollie#2239: I’m just not a fan of black and white jam since it seems like it’s *too* limiting, they should at least allow a gradient between the 2 colours instead to make like a inside kinda style
 theChief#0001: Ah that's fair, but you can use pre-existing assets right? So you could take the shader into it ☺️
 theChief#0001: It's actually not, you just get highest marks for 2 colours only 😂
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: no black and white jam is two colours only
 RocketCow#5210: aaah, GBcamera, my beloved
 Yollie#2239: We were talking about that before, and i was saying that that’s probably the only general style you could do for the jam with the game still being playable and that the shader work required would be quite a lot for 7 days
 SlamBamActionman#7160: And that got huger
 SlamBamActionman#7160: At least the part that matters
 SlamBamActionman#7160: That Iron Lung game is ostensibly black and white
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: Oh definitly
 Yollie#2239: Not saying 3d is too hard for jams in general, just saying that it seems dumb that you need to go to such lengths to make 3d fit in the black and white jam
 theChief#0001:  have you seen Return of the Obra Dinn? That's a VERY good 1 bit 3d game
 RocketCow#5210: Yeah, I'm still not getting it...
 Yollie#2239: I’m saying at a glance. If you look at the 2 games thoroughly you will be able to identify them pretty easily, however they’d have a lot more similarities in the graphics compared to 2 3d games made for another jam such as this one
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: tounge-tied btw
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: The winner from last year gmtk game jam was 3d, made by a 1 person team. The models were simple. but the gameplay was fun, and so it won.
 Emily The Undertale Loving Furry#6588: Hello :D
 Triggered#6897: Yeah, you are right it will still be similar
 Yollie#2239: It’s only 48 hours which makes me want to cry
 RocketCow#5210: if the style is different, as proposed, how would the games look the same? I don't understand the argument you're trying to make here.
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: XC
 Yollie#2239: That is true, but both games will look about the same compared to like, idk, if you take 2 3d games from a jam like brackeys jam
 BadPiggy#5202: F
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: XD looks happy XC locks dead . xd without the l looks like xc which looks dead.  I don't know why this is what I though of when I saw xd
 Yollie#2239: No you could not say that about every game, just seems really difficult in this instance to make all the shaders required and also develop a somewhat style and also make a good game on top of that
 BadPiggy#5202: Cus of LD ? xd
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: Oh for some reason I had 72 hours in my head
 MolassesLover#4128: Oh wait I forgot this was in the context of a jam nvm
 Triggered#6897: Hmm, can't argue with that l, alhough maybe design of models can radically change the overall look
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: i have seen a aaa game defined as 'a game where you can turn around and see $50k worth of work in glasses on a table'
 Yollie#2239: I suppose? However, if there were 2 3d games in the jam they’d both look pretty similar to each other, graphics wise
 RocketCow#5210: 48 hours, so 2 days
 Triggered#6897: 2
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: gmtk is only 3 days though, right?
 snuffysam#2767: i'm just saying you could say "you can't make graphics that quality in a week" about *any* 3D game. yes, there's a lot of 3D art in most professional 3D games
 🌵MiniMinnow#8908: when is the jam going live?
 Triggered#6897: Really it boils downt to if someone have exp. With something similar beforehand, than they would be able to achieve something pretty during the jam
 MolassesLover#4128: Nothing wrong with using 100% premade assets, it just depends how you use them. It's like D&D books, you can follow the use of every creature religiously or you can create a beautiful narrative using them that people are addicted to (The Adventure Zone)
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: oh well they are....
or are they?
No, they are.
 BadPiggy#5202: Au contraire ;)
 Yollie#2239: 2.5d is possible but that’s kinda going into the non 3d style, but like, aside from toon shading with outlines and simple texturing there’s not much more you could do to change it up
 MolassesLover#4128: I wasn't asking I was just asserting that those are numbers lawl
 Yollie#2239: 1) now cmon bro I know you’re allowed to use premade assets but if half your graphics is premade that’s a bit much right?
2) yes if you rely on all those it’s possible
3) my point still stands, that is probably one of the only styles you could do in a 3d game, there are a few more but compared to if you were allowed, say, a gradient or more colours theres a lot less
 BadPiggy#5202: - render the camera at a lower resolution
- have the camera vibrate about it's position by a small amount
Gives you a nice dither effect
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: rgb not hsv
 MolassesLover#4128: Numbers
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: 184, 22, 60
245, 186, 37
25, 59, 168
101, 144, 194
lol
 BadPiggy#5202: If you want a basic dithering effect, I use this poor man's method
 BadPiggy#5202: Idk how to use shaders yet tbh lol
 Yollie#2239: Could probably do it with some shader magic
 snuffysam#2767: define "that quality" and "in a week"
because i have a lot of 3D models that i can use, and i have already programmed similar shaders in Unity that lower colors with dithering patterns
 MolassesLover#4128: Return of the Obra Dinn is literally what I had in my mind but 16k omg
 Triggered#6897: I remember reading an post of the devs.
I dont remember exactly but its just dithering patterns with regular 3d models
 BadPiggy#5202: You should get a similar effect
Not as good but it's something
 BadPiggy#5202: Actually
If you just render your camera to a lower resolution and tweak it
 Yollie#2239: Oh yeah that game did it really well, except I doubt graphics of that quality would be possible in a week
 MolassesLover#4128: I guess you can just render your game at 16k and use dithering and it'll look like it has gradients?
 BadPiggy#5202: One of the few games I've played which I'd consider God-tier
And further cemented my love for  minimal palletes
 snuffysam#2767: obra dinn is a 3D two-color game?
it's black & uhhh cyan not black & white, but same idea
 Triggered#6897: Return of the obra dinn
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: Well a couple of prototypes and little jam things, but no larger projects
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: Nope, just a bunch of random ideas
 Yollie#2239: Yeah which is why I don’t like it lol
 MolassesLover#4128: Welp, yeah, then you're screwed
 BadPiggy#5202: See, you already have a game lol
 Yollie#2239: Or just 2 colours in general
 MolassesLover#4128: Ohhh
 Yollie#2239: No I’m talking about it’s black white gradient, I think black and white jam only allows monochrome not greyscale
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: So blood red, mustard, and cerulean, as well as a lighter desaturated blue
 BadPiggy#5202: Inside has like a 6 colour pallete and it uses it beautifully lol
 Yollie#2239: I mean you could try, but it’s gonna be reallll hard if you’re gonna limit yourself to only 2 colours and still have stuff be distinguishable from each other
 MolassesLover#4128: Yes, but it's so desaturated that it's not dissimilar. They rely heavily on various VFX all the time
 BadPiggy#5202: I'd say :
2 colours which complement each other
1 colour which is a shade of one of the above two
1 colour which contrasts with the above 3
This works beautifully
 Yollie#2239: That game has a gradient of colours
 Triggered#6897: Toon Shading?
 Yollie#2239: Yes but my point still stands
 MolassesLover#4128: You have to play Inside
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: Not necessarily black and white, could be any 2 colors
 Yollie#2239: Actually 3d games in general get a bit handicapped
 MolassesLover#4128: ??? It does
 Yollie#2239: Also cmon black and white only means you can’t do any cool visual effects in 3d like nice lighting and stuff
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: 2 colors vs 4?
 MolassesLover#4128: 1 bit is sooo much better than 2 bit
 theChief#0001: I personally think 3-4 colours is the sweet spot!
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: I think 2 bit is ideal. 1 bit is just too limiting
 MolassesLover#4128: That sounds horrible
 theChief#0001: You can do a lot more with a limited palette
 Yollie#2239: It’s so much more limited with only 2 colours though, especially since the majority of game devs do pixel art and then you end up with every thumbnail there being indistinguishable at a glance lol
 BadPiggy#5202: When it comes to art, games etc, I love it when the pallete is just 2-3 colours
 MolassesLover#4128: A black and white version of Undertale wouldn't look anything like a black and white version of Horizon
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: Lot's of work though. My pfp took 2 weeks of procrastination
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: I like non-pixel aswell
 MolassesLover#4128: I mean, there's a lot of nuance to any art style regardless of saturation
 BadPiggy#5202: Bruh moment
 Yollie#2239: Ngl I don’t like black and white jam because all the games end up looking exactly the same, but I guess that’s the point of black and white jam huh
 Yollie#2239: Yes good idea
 BadPiggy#5202: Apologies, read your comment as " I've done the black and white game jam "
Which is essentially a jam where you have to make a 1-bit game
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: Nahh save my energy for GMTK
 Yollie#2239: Just gotta not sleep
 Yollie#2239: Oof, but it’s fine, you can still do well with minimal time
 snuffysam#2767: 1-bit where? in the jam i participated in?
pretty sure i was the only two-color game there
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: I didn't know untill too late
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: Oh no.... I'm coming up with ideas for the minijam
 Yollie#2239: Ahh you’re making a game for mini jam, I was going to but then loss of motivation and ideas on first day massive family fishing trip second day
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: For 1 bit I think dark blue and light blue could be nice
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: Oh... I forgot somehow
 BadPiggy#5202: That's because every game is 1-bit there and so people know that there are more games than downwell which have 1-bit palletes lol
 Yollie#2239: That’s for mini jam lol
 snuffysam#2767: though the artstyle didn't look anything like downwell, it was silhouettes
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: I think the random theme was sacrifice, and death is inevitable.
 snuffysam#2767: idk, i've done a black & white game and i haven't had those comments lol
 BadPiggy#5202: Ooo, a mechanic where you self YEET. Me like
 Yollie#2239: Wow that’s morbid
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: 2^-1=1/2 not -1
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: I had a weird game idea where you die, then throw your dead body at enemy's. Depending on how you die your dead body changes and damages differently
 Yollie#2239: -1 bit game, it deletes image files off your computer
 BadPiggy#5202: Just make sure that you don't use a black and white colour pallete
Cus then your comment section will just be filled with " reminds me of downwell "
 Yollie#2239: 0 bit game, only audio
 BadPiggy#5202: Noiceee
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: I want to
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: I haven't made a 1 bit game yet....
 Yollie#2239: Squares lol, there was a geojam for that
 Yollie#2239: Got lots of room for shading and it’s small enough to make a ton for a jam
 BadPiggy#5202: Make a game that uses 2^0 x 2^0 art
 Yollie#2239: That’s the generic ones, I find 32 x 32 to be too big and 16 x 16 to be too small so 24x24 is sweat spot
 BadPiggy#5202: Same lol
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: I only use 2^n x 2^n for some reason
 Yollie#2239: Pro tip 24x24 is pogger
 BadPiggy#5202: I love action games
Nothing more I can say apart from that XD
 Yollie#2239: I’m hella impressed you haven’t gotten bored of making them yet
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: preferably no pc at all
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: tile based - no walk cycle needed
 BadPiggy#5202: How'd you guess kek
Oh wait, lol
3 and 1 unreleased one. So you're right. 4 lol
 SpoonyHudson#7262: "a robot with tank treads dont need a walk cycle so that what the PC is"
 Yollie#2239: I’m guessing, they’re all 2.5d side on beatemups with that usual style you have with the pixel art stick figures?
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: 16x16 is easier
 BadPiggy#5202: Just do 8x8 or 16x16 pixel art and use a max of like 3 colours.
You'd be surprised how beautiful your game can look lol
 JJfriends#3686: If the theme is keep growing I'ma make a dick growing simulator
 Scolon#4218: It's easier to work solo in jam experiences tbh
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: Just kind of trip and fall until you have something
 BadPiggy#5202: Same
 Yollie#2239: Yes agreed, some people work better solo (me lol)
 JJfriends#3686: I don't know how to do art
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: My cat seems to have nothing to do during game jams except lie on my computer keyboard, but wants nothing to do with me the rest of the year
 BadPiggy#5202: Going the lone ~~pig~~ wolf route can sometimes be better than teaming up tbh
You know very well what you can and can't do so you can go about things more quickly
Though the same applies to experienced teams kek
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: It's more stressful, but more rewarding. For me teams just make me try to blame all my problems on everyone else, so doing it myself means that if somethings wrong there's no-one to blame (except my cat). That's just me, and I'm weird though
 SpoonyHudson#7262: what i did last year.
 JJfriends#3686: I need someone to carry me on my back
 BadPiggy#5202: Aye, nothing wrong with going solo.
 JJfriends#3686: I've messaged like 10 people and they all said they're busy 😢
 BadPiggy#5202: That's the spirit
Jinx
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: That's the spirit
 JJfriends#3686: Fuck it I'm going solo and I'ma make the world's best game
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: Art?
 JJfriends#3686: Unity is the only thing ik how to do
 BadPiggy#5202: Oof. Making it sound like a job interview lol
Which in a way, I guess it is
 JJfriends#3686: Dang
 Epicshaner DX#6228: Yeah I don't want you either, the Unity pool is flooded this year
 JJfriends#3686: Unity
 Epicshaner DX#6228: In Game Maker?
 JJfriends#3686: Code
 Epicshaner DX#6228: What do you do?
 BadPiggy#5202: Then go solo and show em that it was a mistake not taking you
 JJfriends#3686: Us rejects make the worse games at the end 😭
 JJfriends#3686: Bruh no one wants me as a teammate this sucks rn lmfao
 BadPiggy#5202: 2 and 1 unreleased one.
You can never have enough beat-em-ups
 SpoonyHudson#7262: that and also probably just any text/tutorials that need to be made in the context of a jam. like makeing sure its all spelt properly and makes sense.
 DrNukeLear#2414: There’s writing as far as plot is concerned which is what you’re thinking of, but also dialogue writing.
 unityAccount#7810: What does writing mean when it comes to game dev?  Coming up with the story for the game?
 theChief#0001: I think particularly audio and sound effects are a little more hands-off for jams, so it's pretty easy for them to switch between a few teams. I imagine writing is pretty similar
 DrNukeLear#2414: I split my time over 3 dev projects during the week, compressing that might be an option next year.
 DrNukeLear#2414: As long as the teams are aware I see no problem with being a contributor to a few as long as time management is ok. If you’re an efficient musician you might be able to produce music for a couple of games. If you’re a pure designer who doesn’t touch code or art you could work across a few projects.
 SpoonyHudson#7262: you can but the teams might be upset with you
 Hobusu#5033: Yeah, there's no rule against it, however what Kinged said is worth keeping in mind
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Even if u can(idk) I wouldn't recommend it unless you're doing a job where you think you can produce work in 2 days for 2 teams at a rate where the games can use your work in the actual game
 theChief#0001: Join as many as you like!
 DrNukeLear#2414: Rule question: can we join multiple teams?
 Sir Snifflewiff#5799: What do you mean? So, it's not related to the spread known as "jam"?
 Jeker#3389: Oh nice, Lua is lovley
 银翼yyyy#3002: Great
 theChief#0001: Yeah, though in theory a jam game shouldn't really get close - if you need to get things trimmed down near the end of the jam post in here and someone should be able to help out ☺️
 银翼yyyy#3002: Alright，thx
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: It's the upload limit imposed by itch.io
 银翼yyyy#3002: Our game must less than 1G...？
 hello there#4536: WA hello there
 MolassesLover#4128: WA!?
 hello there#4536: WA
 RedTeapot#1960: Ah, I see
 MolassesLover#4128: I do still think both are absolutely amazing, it's just my preference
 MolassesLover#4128: I prefer working on a lower level than Godot is designed for, whilst also using more modern rendering techniques
 RedTeapot#1960: Why do you like Wicked more than Godot? Just curious. I think Godot lacks 3D graphics juice but the editor seems great
 MolassesLover#4128: Yeah, that's understandable
 Aiminer357#8033: oof thats a bit of deal breaker for me. im a 2d dev only
 MolassesLover#4128: Why what?
 RedTeapot#1960: Why though?
 MolassesLover#4128: I like it better than Godot, though
 MolassesLover#4128: The editor is nowhere near finished yet and in a bit of a bad place, so sorry if it isn't the most pleasant experience. A lot of people are working on it every day, and it'll likely look way different by version 1.0
 MolassesLover#4128: Awesome, I hope you like it
 Arsen-NET#5708:  i take a look
 MolassesLover#4128: The 2D features are very lacking compared to something like Unity but the 3D features are amazing
 RedTeapot#1960: The screenshots I found look sweet
 MolassesLover#4128: Both, it's like most engines in that sense
 MageOwL#4168: cool!
 MolassesLover#4128: Lua or C++ but I'm making bindings for other languages
 Arsen-NET#5708:  for 3D, 2D? both?
 Aiminer357#8033: interesting, might look into it in the future
 MolassesLover#4128: It has a really steep learning curve but it's so powerful
 MageOwL#4168: nice! what language?
 MolassesLover#4128: Yeah, free and open-source
 MageOwL#4168: huh, never heard of it. is it open source?
 MolassesLover#4128: Godog lawl
 Coffe#5594: :godog:
 MolassesLover#4128: Wicked Engine! I'm not new to it, I have been contributing to its development for a while now
 RedTeapot#1960: Godot Gang
 NitramiuZ#4145: Godot for the win!
 MageOwL#4168: 🙂
 dardasaba#9759: I use Godot
 MageOwL#4168: same. I picked it up earlier this year
 Arsen-NET#5708: Pixel Mame maker Mv, no one knows it but its quite easy to use
 Aiminer357#8033: Unity. 4 years and counting
 RedTeapot#1960: Godot. Use it since GMTK 2020
 MageOwL#4168: what game engine do you plan on using? r u new to it?
 Aiminer357#8033: ive always used lmms for my music but idk if its "easy"
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: Cool thanks!
 Stog#9443: Ah
 Madness#5032: Sun Tzu actually
 RedTeapot#1960: Bosca Ceoil maybe. I also tried SunVox but that's a tracker (and a modular synth too). Both are free
 Merus#7019: maybe dial down the spice, I think
 RedTeapot#1960: This, and maybe automate the export and upload process (I know it is possible with Godot, not sure about Unity/Unreal/etc.)
 Virtucious#1251: heh?
 Stog#9443: “The only easy software is the one you’re not using” - Jeffrey Epstein I think
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: What software is easy to access for music. I’m not home right now, where the music software that I usually use is, so preferably something free.
 nilsmunch#2823: or learn about itch's butler system, so you avoid stressing the web front and can hook up directly to the server 🙂
 Stog#9443: 🗿👍
 Teslobo#8274: Please do not use the grace period to do extra work on the game. You will miss the deadline and have no salvation
 Jeker#3389: if you bring one for me too, yes
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: And at least make sure the game builds and works well before the end. The issue where unity web builds with default compression settings don't work on itch trips up literally hundreds of people during big jams
 Stog#9443: Am I allowed to bring a sandwich
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Upload/submit early, folks.
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: It's always a massive pain and huge amounts of extra work to do so
 Stog#9443: 👀
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: Yeah mark's been very clear he's not making any exceptions after the built-in grace period this year
 nilsmunch#2823: If anyone needs help quickly showing your skillset and balancing your needs for team compositions, we set up a tool at www.DevDots.io
Free to use, no tracking no ads.
 Jonathor#1971: Making a build every 90 mins would be really hard to coordinate with a large team
 Merus#7019: if you blow it on dev, you won't get more
 Merus#7019: the plan this year is that there's a built in two hour grace period at the end of the jam, to hopefully stop everything falling over in the final minutes
 Tarkanyil2000#8503: Thats smart didn´t even know that this is possible😂
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: I start making regular builds and uploads about midday Sunday, and try to upload a new build every 60-90 minutes; if everything goes wrong in the final few hours, I can be confident at least I've got _something_
 Tarkanyil2000#8503: Wow thats huge. A lot of games to try I guess. Even if I won´t be able to submit it will be really interesting to play your games
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: There's a grace period at the end of the jam for uploading your game (full details on the itch page), but I 100% cannot recommend highly enough _not_ to rely on that
 Teslobo#8274: Last year had 50,000 signups
 Jonathor#1971: If the servers crashed and you can't upload it, do they give one more hour of grace period or nah?
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: Yep!
 Tarkanyil2000#8503: Are there that many participants😅
 Tarkanyil2000#8503: Hm ok yes all of these tips are really helpful, especially to keep a small scope
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: Scope _extremely_ small, and take breaks to build, test, and upload your game - you don't want to find out the game doesn't work in the last 30 minutes of the jam when you can't upload a new one because the servers are crashing!
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: If something is taking too long think of a way to get around it, you might have to change your idea to make it doable
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: Spend your first hour after making your idea to schedule your time use. Keep 3 hours at the end for when something inevitably takes longer.
 Teslobo#8274: Don't feel pressured if you feel overwhelmed. A consistent message is to not burn yourself out trying to meet the arbitrary deadline. Many people don't submit in the end or submit something unfinished. That's ok
 Phallo#3476: also with this small of a timeframe... always create something more simple than what you think you can do as most games fail because there is not enough time
 Tarkanyil2000#8503: It´s my first game jam. What should I expect how do I approach this large workload within such a short time frame? Any recommendation would help😅
 Phallo#3476: if you are really new to game developing i would recommend practicing before the jam so the little things have less of a chance to slip you up when it really matters
 Teslobo#8274: It's happened every year now, we consider it likely to happen again
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: Lol
 DrNukeLear#2414: Ironically it was “Pi or Pie”.
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: What do you mean by reccomendations?
 Tarkanyil2000#8503: Hey fellas I´m new into game dev and I´m really excited to take part in this game jam. Do you have any recommendations?
 Phallo#3476: itch.io devs will be sweating bullets on sunday
 Aiminer357#8033: we will break itch.io again
 Madness#5032: there is more people every year
 LEB#3729: 
 Phallo#3476: i wouldnt be surprised... also that is part of the reason why there is 2 hours after to upload the game
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: Especially because there is more people this year
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: I would imagine so
 MolassesLover#4128: I wonder if that's going to happen again
 Lyfe#8258: Hey remember when so many people tried to upload game jam entries at the same time that the itchio servers stopped working
 Tate | No Bloat Studios#5674: Hello! I'm looking for a 3D artist for my team 🙂
 LEB#3729: I swear I can recognise so many people here
 Wallkick#6969: Welcome to the gun show
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Shoot to move, but your fists are guns.
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: No problem!
 Astral#7476: I love Space Jam
 Astral#7476: xD
 Teslobo#8274: Welcome to the JAM
 Teslobo#8274: As a certain 90s hit movie once said
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: Mine too… we’ll I’ve done others just never submitted on time
 Astral#7476: This is actually my first jam 🙂
 woofl#2379: thanks Pi!
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754: What everyone’s favorite theme they’ve gotten?
 MyPieceOfThePi#2754:  is really helpful for finding teams
 woofl#2379: 🇨🇳BST 2D artist looking for a team (PM me if u need one^^
 Astral#7476: Which Jeker, shamelessly took haha (This is a joke btw, afterall, we are in the same team)
 Astral#7476: I had like, 4 ideas xD
 Teslobo#8274: Jam themes tend to be loose enough to bend to whatever you want to make
 Yollie#2239: You’ve made like 4 beatemups in a row now lmao
 BadPiggy#5202: I just hope the jam gives me a decent enough reason to make another beat-em-up lol
 Tsunami#0963: Only 2 more
 Jeker#3389: mhm indeed lol
 Astral#7476: With my ideas xD
 Madness#5032: hello, gamers
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: awesome, i'm hyped :)
 Gabriel [BluishGreenPro]#5666: Hello! I am indeed; and I've booked off the entire following week for Interview streams!
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: if we can that means it's an option for the jam! though, I think a more puzzly mechanic will do better
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: I'm practicing by seeing if our team can make a roguelike in 48ish hours
 Jeker#3389: i am so hyped for this, i want to use my level editor lol (even tho, i'll most likley make either an infinite scorer, or a roguelike)
 Spotted_Leaf#8475: oh hey gabriel! looking forward to the jam?
 Olsie#4351: 15,30 for me XD
 Nectar#2888: Gmorning gen
 ConstantDerivative#6302: its 10:30pm for me lol
 Gabriel [BluishGreenPro]#5666: Good Morning!
 Olsie#4351: good meevening XD afternoon
 Giselle#9395: Good morning
 plopdapug2#6607: Good morbeving
 Astral#7476: Hi!
 CSGO enjoyer#7529: Good afternoon
 RedTeapot#1960: Good morvening
 Nobody6502#8971: Good morning guys
 Olsie#4351: supsup
 BadPiggy#5202: Loool
 BadPiggy#5202: Lol. Thanks
 Lawn#1538: The last game I saw of yours looked pretty ace Piggy
 BadPiggy#5202: That's easy for me
All my games make people cry because of how broken they are
 CALSYTHE#6648: ha that should be the theme for the game mayo
 caibi#2508: a game that make people cry
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Yeah, it'll be enabled for that channel
 CALSYTHE#6648: all games start by prepping the game onions
 caibi#2508: add a super high quality model, egg and some salt to the game, you will get a __Fried Game Egg__
 Lawn#1538: The `jam` in `game jam` comes from the musical term for a `jam session`
 CALSYTHE#6648: always down for a helping of game whip
 caibi#2508: game cashew will be better
 MrBen#0001: 🫙
 CALSYTHE#6648: game mayo!
 caibi#2508: game jam on toast
 Yollie#2239: damn theres so many people i recognise this jam
 Astral#7476: Oh, glad to hear! 🙂
 MrBen#0001: 🍱
 Jeker#3389: yep lol
 caibi#2508: ~~I am fine, thank you~~
 Astral#7476: Hi!
 Yollie#2239: oh people from creators campfire are here
 Astral#7476: I am doing good as well, thanks for asking!
 Jeker#3389: hi astral :DDDD
 MrBen#0001: good, and you?
 Astral#7476: How are you?
 MrBen#0001: heyy!
 Astral#7476: Hi!
 caibi#2508: me 2
 MrBen#0001: yep
 null_ham#2050: jk i really hope we can send images
 null_ham#2050: we use imgur
 MrBen#0001: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 caibi#2508: how we can’t send image to share image
 MrBen#0001: we will be allowed to add images in  ?
 CALSYTHE#6648: thats good news
 Merus#7019: I am thrilled to report someone taught Violent J how magnets work
 caibi#2508: ask Mark, trust Marks aways
 CALSYTHE#6648: what if its magnets...  but the twist is you have to not know how they work...
 Triggered#6897: Is there a bot that auto. Inc/dec slowdown based on online users
 Lawn#1538: This shift seems to be pretty tame compared to when I go to sleep.
 Sandra#4621: but y'know, when it gets busy it'll go back up
 Sandra#4621: honestly right now it can probably go down to 5s because this channel is really not busy right now
 caibi#2508: I believe I will
 Sandra#4621: just y'know, we're still keeping an eye on it.
 Lawn#1538: When the jam starts, hopefully you will come to love slowmode.
 caibi#2508: oh~
 Sandra#4621: yeah I mean if you want to go and edit your messages, go right ahead we have no problem with that 😛
 caibi#2508: he’s gone, again
 Merus#7019: I mean sending a full and complete message is perfectly reasonable. If it's abused to fill the chat window, well that's what mods are here for.
 caibi#2508: well, Mark is online, is it online for the $10 (just kidding)
 null_ham#2050: quantum physics.
 Lawn#1538: Last year was basically magnets.
 BurnV06#5857: Magnets is too specific tbh
 caibi#2508: I think discord slow mode is dump, you can just edit a message to say anything you want. like this
 caibi#2508: haha
 Merus#7019: listen Mark is already getting $10 a month from me
 Merus#7019: purely because I don't think Mark wants to encourage a huge pool of ideas for magnet games that he then has to avoid using
 null_ham#2050: but 🌠marketing opportunity for mark🌠
 caibi#2508: What if Mark change his mind because this $10 lmao
 Merus#7019: I would bet $10 it's not magnets
 caibi#2508: if it’s magnet I will just upload my stupidy gravity game
 Lawn#1538: For my unborn child's sake, I hope it won't be magnets.
 GAmeDOS#1097: It won’t be magnets lmao
 caibi#2508: Yesss, it work **PERFECTLY** thx very much dude
 Lawn#1538: If the theme is magnets, I'll name my first child Magnet.
 caibi#2508: nah, I already tried it, it a marker
 DrNukeLear#2414: If it’s magnets.... I’ll add some snapping to my drag and drop elements lol
 andrei#8008: i'm ready to make some magnets, who else? 😄 or at least that's why my guess on theme is
 Lawn#1538: Hand sanitiser should too.
 DrNukeLear#2414: That too.
 Lawn#1538: isopropyl works
 caibi#2508: I will try it, thx
 DrNukeLear#2414: Add salt to the ink, it might soak it up if it’s still drying.
 caibi#2508: f||or||k, my marker is leaking ink, it made my whole hand to blaaack. **AHHHHH, HOW TO CLEAN ITTT HELPPP**
 DrNukeLear#2414: Which reminds me, I need to make sure GarageBand works on my old iPad.
 DrNukeLear#2414: I compose music while I cook.
 Lawn#1538: Definitely recommend that you pre-cook your meals or order take out, having to cook dinner mid-jam is an interesting time.
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: I second the 'no crunch' stance; I highly recommend treating the jam like a busy weekend of overtime at work.
 Mr. Tophat#9572: Yes, I know, I'll adjust my idea to the theme
 caibi#2508: gl,by the way, you must match the theme of the jam, the theme will release on jam start
 ConstantDerivative#6302: good luck, and do not crunch
make around 3-5 levels, sleep well, treat it as a game jam game and not a full steam game being released in 2 days
 Mr. Tophat#9572: Hello
I've never been in a game jam before, and my only experience with game development is in Game Maker, but I want to challenge myself and see if I can put out something playable and decent within the 48h timeframe
I'll probably aim for a Myst-style puzzle adventure that's completable in about 5-15 minutes
Even then, I'll probably have to go into instant crunch mode and treat this like an assignment that's due in one hour if I want to get this finished in time
 Light Maker 🍧#8953: Oh it did
 Light Maker 🍧#8953: Bleh
 ConstantDerivative#6302: oh i just realized slowmode got lowered here
 ConstantDerivative#6302: 5 seconds tho, not that bad
 Light Maker 🍧#8953: But there's still slowmode in the hype channel
 MrBen#0001: yep
 Merus#7019: the goal is to keep this channel always relatively readable;  is for people to talk freely and thereby be chaos
 Triggered#6897: Or worse, **E**
 Lawn#1538: That'd be chaos.
 ConstantDerivative#6302: the chat will just implode if they do that
 Lawn#1538: no.
 Lawn#1538: lol
 Merus#7019: counter-suggestion: no
 Sandra#4621: hahahahaha no
 MrBen#0001: turn off slowmode when the theme goes live
 Light Maker 🍧#8953: Well I'm still quite nervous. I'm mainly gonna be leading my team on whatever happens. My main role is as the Writer and I don't know how much story we'll be able to do in this.
 Light Maker 🍧#8953: Dang.
 Sandra#4621: slowmode timer will be adjusted but never actually turned off in this channel
 MrBen#0001: yep
 Light Maker 🍧#8953: Wow slowmode is still on?
 Lawn#1538: a shmoover if you will.
 Lawn#1538: shoot to move*
 jynus#2018: No matter the theme,, someone is always going to find how to do "shoot to jump" 🤣
 Lawn#1538: Same, a super specific niche theme would be fun, but there are tonnes of those on itch.io.
 Jeker#3389: i think those are the best themes
 Lawn#1538: The themes tend to be pretty vague in their interpretation, so you can often take your game ideas anywhere.
 Lawn#1538: One could interpret last year's theme 'joined together' as 'combining genres', so in a sense it's already been done.
 jynus#2018: That would be maybe too specific for a jam, specially this one, but I can see it like "best of 2 (worlds)" or something like that, more open for interpretation
 BurnV06#5857: One theme I hope they use some year is “combining genres”. I really like games that combine multiple genres, and I find them very interesting. Plus it would make a pretty good jam theme
 YaBoiHammad#1204: i can already tell
 YaBoiHammad#1204: the theme for this jam is gonna be interesting
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: behind, uh, gmtk 2021 and gmtk 2020
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: third largest jam on itch then
 BurnV06#5857: We just passed 15k joined in the jam. Nice
 Jeker#3389: (an actual one this time, ui and everything lol)
 DrNukeLear#2414: 👍
 Jeker#3389: woooo my level editor works
 DrNukeLear#2414: I’m here for the marmalade
 MrBen#0001: me me me
 SaadTheGlad#9716: who's ready to jam
 BlueMischief#0917: general kenobi
 SaadTheGlad#9716: Hello there
 ConstantDerivative#6302: nice
 Aiminer357#8033: currently making it into a mobile game
 Aiminer357#8033: even helped me make genres i would not usually play/make like last years jam
 Lawn#1538: Baba is You
 Lawn#1538: Hollow Knight
 ConstantDerivative#6302: like celeste
 null_ham#2050: restricts produce creativity
 null_ham#2050: yep
 quyteriyaki#6095: I really loved shotgun king that was part of I think the last ludum dare
 Lawn#1538: There are plenty examples of great games that started out as jam games, many of which went on to win the indie lottery.
 null_ham#2050: imho a lot of really good games have started as a game jam project
 quyteriyaki#6095: The interesting thing about jams is what you can make new during it, rather than what you can already do. If you're looking to do a platformer, it isn't really fun writing a generic platformer over and over again, you're not doing anything new, you're not generating anything new, but if you add a new fancy mechanic each time (hence why the prompts differ), it becomes more exciting for both development and play tests
 ConstantDerivative#6302: yeah, crunch really hurts the final product and the way i think about the game i made
 Teslobo#8274: whatever it takes to fit that mold
 Teslobo#8274: the requirement is that it can run either in browser or a downloadable and executable programme with no third party downloads required
 quyteriyaki#6095: ~~re use game templates because it hurts your sanity to rewrite it all the time~~
 caibi#2508: What about use java to make the game, am I suppost to pack it into exe?
 Teslobo#8274: general advice
 theChief#0001: Absolutely, yeah!
 ConstantDerivative#6302: wait nvm i thought that was a question im bad at reading apparently
 caibi#2508: Can I use my own engine?
 Jeker#3389: well, to be fair i started development on this for another project, so i guess its allowed
 theChief#0001: We can't give individual advice, but generally don't be writing specific stuff for this jam before it starts. Reused character controllers and things like that are fine ☺️ for example, I've got some character movement code, some powerup code, and some bullet spawning code - all of which either is already or will be packaged and sold out he unity asset store!
 Lawn#1538: Beat me to it
 Teslobo#8274: ```You can use pre-existing code, libraries, and functions. But we ask that you don’t write code specifically for this jam, ahead of time.
You can also create things like a blank Unity project, a Github page, or your itch.io profile in advance to save time.
The jam moderators cannot advise you individually on what pre-existing code is or isn't allowed. So please use your best judgement and work within the spirit of the rules.```
 Dragonite#5414: It’s allowed but some people prefer to make a game completely from scratch up to you though
 MrBen#0001: a little bit of ctrl + c and ctrl + v
 MrBen#0001: well great then
 Jeker#3389: i think so yeah
 MrBen#0001: hey btw is using some of my old game movement allowed?
 Jeker#3389: i am starting to realise, i should probably finish my level editor before the jam
 MrBen#0001: yep
 Sapient#3138: It might be a user or website since ik the guy with a different #number not the exact guy tho , it might be that he just used the discord's own alt feature
 null_ham#2050: its just how UE is built
 MrBen#0001: yeah I just dig through it and deleted like 100 mb from it (it made no difference)
 Dragonite#5414: UE kinda built for big AAA games so it has a lot of files etc
 null_ham#2050: theres alot of stuff from UE in the files
 Sapient#3138: Ahh nice
 MrBen#0001: Anyone has idea why ue projects r so big? I mean I use it for 3 years now but im just curious what takes 300 mb without any optimalizations (after disabling ue content and all that stuff the projects is 80 mb)
 caibi#2508: Mark is so rich, I wanna buy a windows server. ;-;
 null_ham#2050: its a discord ID
 Teslobo#8274: I feel like it's a problem on the end of the user but I can flag it with the website team just in case
 Sapient#3138: oof
 MrBen#0001: its probably a user that left
 null_ham#2050: oh yeah the teamfinder is just sometimes pinging discord id's
 Teslobo#8274: I don't think there's anything that can be done about that
 Sapient#3138: That's... the whole point , who is he...?
 Teslobo#8274: oh, I see
 Sapient#3138: He pinged me in the team finder , but idk what to do
 Teslobo#8274: wait, who?
 Sapient#3138: How am i suppose to contact him
 null_ham#2050: what
 Sapient#3138:  uhhh who is he
 Teslobo#8274: Just remember why you're taking part in the first place. Hopefully the reason for taking part isn't to win or my advice goes out the window
 null_ham#2050: no yeah game jams are all about mindset
 Aiminer357#8033: as cheesy as that sounds
 Aiminer357#8033: dont expect to win. finish this jam with friends, experience and fun
 Lawn#1538: Definitely, it can be easy to blow your scope out the window.
 null_ham#2050: also dont be afraid to cut down on content. this isnt a AAA steam release, this is a weekend game jam.
 Aiminer357#8033: game jams are fun but always take care of yourself
 null_ham#2050: also water
 Merus#7019: oh for sure, don't crunch _yourself_
 Aiminer357#8033: yes make sure you rest well for this
 Lawn#1538: A well rested mind can do wonders Ben.
 MrBen#0001: nah
 Lawn#1538: +1 for sleeping. You *think* you will be game a dev master when sleep deprived, but will likely experience diminishing returns and create more issues than you solve.
 MrBen#0001: my exams already took place 😏
 ConstantDerivative#6302: alright, thanks for the advice!
 NotQuiteCool#8511: Also, if you're in a team, talk! Check in with each other. Are things moving along? Do we need to cut scope?
 theChief#0001: Sleep!!!! Sleep sleep sleep. And eat veg, and drink lots of water. You'll make dumb mistakes if your body is complaining 😂
Plan around making a game that you think will take around 20-30% of the time you have available. I'm planning on doing 2 8-10 hour days, so I'll be making a game I think should take me 4-6 hours ☺️
 NotQuiteCool#8511: It's better to have a small ugly game that is finished than a big pretty game that isn't.
 Merus#7019: you'll need half the available time for bugfixing and polish, so aim to be feature complete after the first day - which means try to have something playable midway through the first day. You'll want to scope _tight_
 caibi#2508: Marks is here, he’s always watching
 null_ham#2050: get sleep
 ConstantDerivative#6302: this is my first game jam, does anyone have any tips for people like me
 Merus#7019: maybe steer away from the scatological puns
 Kridotsuk#7378: My exams start on 18th lmao, right after the jam
 Kridotsuk#7378: Nice
 MrBen#0001: mostly I didnt upload to previous gamejams due to lack of time or self-motivation
 MrBen#0001: same here but this time its holiday so I have 2 DAYS!
 Kridotsuk#7378: :(
 Kridotsuk#7378: Both the brakeys game jams and the GMTK game jams every year coincide with my exams
Every time
 MrBen#0001: the chat here never stops 24/7
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: I just want to take a second to reiterate how goddamn funny this comment is - if you've never seen it, watch Total Recall, it's well worth it
 linoooo21#3488: How many of us use monogame on a mac?
 linoooo21#3488: and a giant meteorite
 Merus#7019: ```A mix between the text-adventure and sports game genres with a competitive splitscreen mode.``` is this Pyre
 Selviam#7268: endless runner of hack and slashing cooking ingredients?
 linoooo21#3488: for me this one takes the cake
 linoooo21#3488: ```A nostalgic mix between the hack-and-slash and endless runner game genres, which tells a story of cooking and the end of the world.```
 Selviam#7268: that sounds fun just mindlessly destroying stuff is fun in a game
 KokoBird#9800: ```A violent roguelike game with destructible terrain.``` that's just nuclear throne
 linoooo21#3488: *elmo musk
 null_ham#2050: ~~elon musk~~
 Selviam#7268: it sounds like a cute idea!
 Merus#7019: Total Recall?
 unityAccount#7810: Look at what the idea generator came up with 😂:
```A programming game where you play as a penniless monster who will stop at nothing to start a new life on mars. ```
 theChief#0001: I once got told I had made an incredibly creative, unique game - it was Space Invaders 😉 it was literally just Space Invaders with a little bit of a twist - when you move, you shoot.
 Lawn#1538: I tend to make games about weird ideas my mates have.
 Lawn#1538: Totally, ideas are a dime a dozen.
 Selviam#7268: Word association is my favorite way!
 linoooo21#3488: I usually just search up a game jam theme generator (or sometimes not), then sit down on my couch, fire up the xbox and start collecting collectables in Assassins Creed Valhalla. It's such a boring task, my mind starts to wonder and quite quickly I come up with a few things to start off from
 theChief#0001: Tbh the idea isn't really worth very much on its own, it's all about execution
 Lawn#1538: Oh yeah, he's a star.
 theChief#0001: Yeah I love seb lague!
 Lawn#1538: I find it easier to build from other ideas rather than try and reinvent the wheel every single time.
But if you're strapped for ideas, there are plenty of them on the internet. You can even use an algorithm for ideas.
 theChief#0001: Oh damn that's right, I remember this 😂
 caibi#2508: Oh great, my unity crashed when I am saving the environment.
 linoooo21#3488: Oh I have my method, no worries, I was just curious how others go about it, since we're all so different
 dardasaba#9759: Idk, I never really need any methods, for me finding an idea is really easy, they just keep coming :P
Sorry I couldn't help more, but I just don't have any tips or methods 🤷‍♂️
 Alicja#3407: (Vib-ribbon game, a real game from 2000 thats exactly this ~~actually not 1D but i had to mention it~~)
 RedTeapot#1960: Going to sleep. I lie in bed thinking about what the theme means, what game mechanics can it induce and so on.
But I've heard people recommending brainstorming though
 linoooo21#3488: Happy to help:D
 badass_graduate#1406: got it thank you
 linoooo21#3488: There’s a link at the top of  . Then you can log in with your discord on the site
 badass_graduate#1406: how to access team finder;help please
 linoooo21#3488: What are some of you people’s methods for coming up with ideas for a game?
 unityAccount#7810: Sooo... what do you guys think of Mark's Developing series?
I was super hyped when it was announced and really enjoy it. I was  surprised to find out how low its episodes rank when it comes to views.
 dardasaba#9759: Good morning!
 theChief#0001: Do something you think you can make in about 25-30% of the time _you have available_. E.g. I'll be working two 8-10 hour days, so I'll plan to make something that should take me 4-5 hours
 Merus#7019: (but the most fundamental thing when making a game for the jam is to have fun)
 Merus#7019: uploading a software executable to itch.io is a core fundamental, for sure
 ﷽﷽#8924: Ooool.
 Selviam#7268: what would you all say is part of the core fundamentals to make a game for the game jam
 OrangoMango#0973: a game in VR
 Lucyfer#7334: Constraints force you to get creative with less to work with, more dimensions give you more things to micromanage
 Lucyfer#7334: I find that whether it's easier depends on what you're trying to do with each dimension and what you're good at. I'm trying to learn pixel art but I find 3D animation a lot easier than having to remake everything each frame, however real 3D animators will beat me up for saying this- they're both challenging in their own ways
 Tapu#9161: Make game in 1D
 OrangoMango#0973: 2d is easier
 Wormdas#5400: Your UVs will be pretty rough, your topo's gonna be dogwater, and your textures are gonna have to be a little slipshod. That's just the reality of jamming.
 Wormdas#5400: If you're really fast with your 3d pipeline and you know your tools well you can absolutely manage it in jam time - I pretty much only jam in 3D - but you have to be very aware of your time constraints and be willing to accept sloppier work than you usually do to get done.
 Selviam#7268: also i just have a preference for 2d art especially pixel art <<33
 mnikn#9647: Someday maybe I will try to make 3d game, but for now I wanna make 2d game
 Wormdas#5400: The big difference between 3d and 2d as far as games production goes is that most of the work with 3D art is frontloaded. If you need 10 animations and you're doing pixel art, you're drawing every one of those frames yourself, it's hugely time consuming. If you're doing 10 animations in 3D, well hey, that's just one rig and several key poses. But if you're doing short form stuff like a jam and you decide you only need a run, jump, and an idle, that's like ~30ish drawings, you can knock that out in an hour. You still have to make the whole rig for a 3d character no matter how many animations it has.
 GameboyFunny101#0057: 4d games in game jams are also pretty rare
 Selviam#7268: and rendering 3d can be demanding and time consuming most of the time when my gf 3d renders an animation it takes a few hours to process
 harper#8662: I see I see
 linoooo21#3488: If I had to guess, it's probably the assets. Making some 2d pixel art, or any kind of 2d art, is much easier than creating a mesh, colouring it, creating the materials and such.
 RedTeapot#1960: Maybe it's harder (or is perceived as such)
 harper#8662: Why do people barely make 3d games for game jams?
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: I suppose my own outlook is different, since my entire life I have been told it was impossible to not even bother to try with many things. Definitely surpassed everyone's expectations. Where I am at now in life was considered impossible for me. It just takes time and it is never too late to do something.
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: There are things that are impossible, but not everything is impossible.
 linoooo21#3488: Yeah, for example, Beethoven, one of the most influential artist from his era, was deaf. He needed that big tube to even hear a little from his pieces. Anything is possible with enough dedication and work put into it
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: And there might be techniques one has not discovered yet. Sometimes it takes thinking about something differently to do it. Most often the common way of doing things is the wrong way for a person, despite being right for most.
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Disadvantages are hard, but still possible to get through them given enough time
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Considering for music that I am interested in, I am HoH, tone deaf, and have other related issues... have been going my own way into it. The stuff I make probably sucks but is a learning experience.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I'm not sure how that;s relevant, I was just starting a conversation about how it sucks when you have motivation to do something but it's super hard
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: ok
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Have not seen your art
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: impostor syndrome would be me feeling like I wasn't able to call myself an artist because I'm "bad" at it or don't deserve it
I'm just saying that I'm not good at drawing people, which is true
 Tapu#9161: Imposter syndrome is feeling like you faked it to make it
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: that's literally not what impostor syndrome means
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Imposter syndrome
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: The planetary orbits have aligned onto the same orbit for me
 KokoBird#9800: The stars have aligned
 theChief#0001: Same! I actually have the whole weekend to work on it/keep an eye on things here
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: A very early 00:17 in the morning, I have sleeping pills instead of coffee
 Selviam#7268: luckily everything  in my schedule aligned perfectly for GMTK
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: All info about when is on the itch page linked in 
 Higgabes#0237: aite thanks
 AkariZero#2463: yup
 Higgabes#0237: jam starts next week rihgt?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: morning
 linoooo21#3488: Good morning jammers. Everybody got their coffee?
 theChief#0001: Given that it's 5am, probably asleep like I want to be 😂
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: I switched from them and the cost of domains was cut down to 1/3, quite the money saver
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: They tend to be really expensive as well
 BadPiggy#5202: Where Mark ?
 snuffysam#2767: i feel like it's been literally a decade since GoDaddy did that with their superbowl ads
just off the top of my head
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: They're great at teasing you with their ads, tho.
 Merus#7019: Unrelated: GoDaddy is not a great DNS provider
 Hobusu#5033: It was *meant* to redirect to the Jam page this year, but I think some technical issues came up with that
 Nobody6502#8971: Ah there we go
 Hobusu#5033: Last year it was its own website for the rules, this year Mark decided it would be best to just have the rules on the Jam page
 Auride#9400: ty ❤️
 ZorroTamalito#0956: from there is just waiting for the jam to start, but the most annoying part would be completed
 Nobody6502#8971: I think it redirected to the itch page last year
 Nobody6502#8971: Noticed this earlier and found it weird
 ZorroTamalito#0956: I'll probably setup a Godot project and setup the pipeline to push the game to Itch.io
 tykenn#8548: Yeah, there's safety in a higher quantity of testers. Breaking only half the time is still bad, but 1 tester might not catch it
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Get someone else to playtest, maybe?
 tykenn#8548: This is me:
1. Hear theme
2. Take shower
3. Come out of shower with idea
4. Spend the rest of the day making something playable, but it's bad
5. Realize what the game was missing and throw it in really fast.
6. Submit a few hours before deadline and ask someone to test it.
7. Submissions close and somehow game-breaking stuff still shows up despite tests somehow
 harshith#7090: Have you ever tried ethanon engine
 MangoWorks#1202: This is how a jam usually goes for me
1. I spend the first day getting the basic idea working
2. I add more things to the game And POLISH
3. I Finnish Up My Game And Hope There No Game Breaking Bugs
 thePotatoLizerd#6390: sup
 harshith#7090: Hi
 xono#1000: my advice is to make it fully playable and where you are happy to submit as early as possible, and then add/polish from there
 DawnDev#2938: My advice for the jam. Keep ideas as simple as possible. Make sure you know how to make the base mechanic of your game and leave experimenting to less necessary mechanics. And quality over quantity. One good level is better than many bad ones. No one will fault you if you're game is short.
 Selviam#7268: my goal is to finish a playable prototype for my current game before GMTK starts then get back to my prototype after the jam
 I Am Kot#1326: Literally went on holiday to America today and am returning in 10 days so I’m gonna miss it 😩😩😩😭😭😭
 Hat Man#2683: I’ll come up with a simple game idea but as I develop it I just have more and more ideas and it eventually gets way over complicated and out of scope
 DrNukeLear#2414: Hi!
 Selviam#7268: i always try to think small for games but my mind always makes them 10 times bigger
 PepperBoi#4544: As everyone says: “Scope Small”
 Nobody6502#8971: finding a second dev is hard 😐
 Hat Man#2683: Same this the the shortest game jam that I’ve participated in
 lilburlap#8480: I tried doing one a while ago and didn't submit so hopefully this'll be my first time finishing one fore the jam
 Xalph555#5377: Hi everyone!
This is also my first gmtk jam, but not my first game jam. The last one I enter had around 100 participants so this is definitely a step up 😅
Can’t wait to see everyone’s games!
 lilburlap#8480: I take this as a personal challenge
 nxsnow#2470: same! my first gmtk! im excited!
 Selviam#7268: my first gmtk toooo ive never done a game jam in such a short amount of time
 mnikn#9647: my first gmtk too, but not my first game jam
 GoodUser#8929: This'll be my first GMTK Game Jam. Kinda nervous
 Selviam#7268: hello and congrats on your first game jaaaam
 adamhorner#4031: Hi!
 Super#7038: Hey everyone, this is my first ever game jam, I am a relatively new game dev, I use unreal engine, and I just wanted to say hi.
 Selviam#7268: good idea i gotta make sure i get my favorite coffee icecream to keep me awake
 wren#0640: gives me plenty of time to prep energy drinks for the all nighters ahead
 wren#0640: glad i realised the jam was going to happen soon today
 MangoWorks#1202: this jam is going to be fun
 MangoWorks#1202: you know
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: it'll be *very* hard to miss
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Mark will put out a video, the website will update and we'll let people know here
 caibi#2508: Thx
 KokoBird#9800: Probably here too but the game jam page is the best bet
 KokoBird#9800: On the website
 caibi#2508: On where, Discord?
 Hobusu#5033: At the start of the Jam
 DrNukeLear#2414: Next Friday
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Next week!
 caibi#2508: When will the theme release? I can’t wait for it.
 null_ham#2050: im looking for an artist lol
 caibi#2508: My mum don’t let me touch the computer
 caibi#2508: So boring
 StormyMay#4100: Oh awesome! Thanks for the info ^^
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Pretty often which is good in my case 😏hehe
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: The best type of statistics logic
 caibi#2508: I can hand out a not completed version
 StormyMay#4100: Ah I just got the message about this game jam from Ethan Becker's server, how often do teams look for artists?
 caibi#2508: I only have 8h on it
 PepperBoi#4544: lol same but ima try to do it in 5 hours lol
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: I've been anticipating this game all year, just to realize that the timing is set at pretty much the worse time conceivable, and I can't compete 💔
 caibi#2508: ahhh
 PepperBoi#4544: Its disabled
 caibi#2508: Web version of dc
 caibi#2508: emmmm,how to send image in dc?
 caibi#2508: any chinese here?
 DrNukeLear#2414: My favourite type of statistics logic.
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: I think generally speaking we see around a 40-50% submission rate so you're a little better than average! (if you use some slightly wonky statistics logic)
 tykenn#8548: I just checked to see how well I've done with jam completion. Apparently I've submitted to 14 out of the 25 I've joined, 56%. No idea if that's higher or lower than what's typical.
 jonahhw#9743: Yeah, and you can also leave the jam if you decide that you aren't going to submit anything (which isn't necessary since you can also just not submit, but it makes me feel better about it)
 Hobusu#5033: That's the spirit
 LethalChicken#3001: Can't wait to be too busy to actually participate!
 tykenn#8548: The early sign up is just nice to get the notifications
 Teslobo#8274: I think you're right. However joining a 48 hour jam midway through may be a death sentence
 Hobusu#5033: Though it's probably best to act like there is one just to be safe
 Hobusu#5033: Yeah, I'm not sure there's actually a cutoff for signups other than 'the Jam has ended'
 tykenn#8548: Also, you should be able to join mid jam I think. At least that's how it's worked for every other jam I've participated in. Like you could join right before submissions close. It's not like you need to reserve your spot before the jam begins
 DaveB#7491: Gotcha!
 Hobusu#5033: Lots of people sign up and then either forget about it or decide not to participate after all
 Hobusu#5033: If he did it would take at least an hour, heh
 DaveB#7491: It’s appreciated. I was kinda wondering if Mark would call out folks who don’t show up. lol
 Teslobo#8274: personal preference is respectable, just making sure you know the option is there
 DaveB#7491: I hate saying I’m gonna do something and not carry through though.
 Teslobo#8274: genuinely no harm in doing it now so you're in
 Teslobo#8274: there's no penalty for not submitting if you sign up
 DaveB#7491: I want to make sure I can fix my Windows build issue before I sign up.
 DaveB#7491: Ah, ok! Thank you. 🙂
 Teslobo#8274: The cutoff is when the counter on the itch page hits 0
 DaveB#7491: Is there a cutoff for signups?
 cheepling#7492: would explain why the category has the year on it
 Lawn#1538: They are probably archived. New year, fresh channel.
 Nobody6502#8971: Kinda weird they aren’t saved year to year, but thanks
 NotQuiteCool#8511: Up until the results video
 Nobody6502#8971: out of curiosity since I don't sub to the patreon, how long do these channels last after the jam? I noticed they're not the same ones as last year which is interesting
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: lol yeah I immediately did that
 Nobody6502#8971: nvm it already is
 caibi#2508: did someone die or upload a 3A game in the jam?
 Nobody6502#8971: this should be pinned tbh
 caibi#2508: Logo is so GMTK
 adamhorner#4031: just what i was looking for
 adamhorner#4031: so glad mark released the platformer playable video essay right around this time
 ThePancakeKing#4241: thanks man
 Techno#1832: Yeah I'd be down to do it again sometime
 Scolon#4218: excellent
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yeah you get to see the patron channels as soon as you pay for the patreon so it can be done at any time. You just link your discord username to the patreon website and it automatically adds you etc
 caibi#2508: Well, I am not adult yet, so… Hmmm
 Lawn#1538: You'll have to save up one dollar for the next month.
 caibi#2508: Ahhh, I have no money in my wallet
 tykenn#8548:  Yeah, the crossover jam was pretty fun. It'd be cool to try something like that again some time. I didn't do too well with planning/coordination the first time, but hopefully I've learned a few things about jam hosting since then.
 KokoBird#9800: Oh I do love the occasional video game every once and a while
 caibi#2508: Oh
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: you'll still be in the server, you just won't be able to access any channels until these ones re-open next year
 Lawn#1538: You also get to talk about Apple products, and the occasional video game.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: the rooms will be closed so you'll just be floating in the void
 CALSYTHE#6648: nut worshipper
 KokoBird#9800: Don't ask me how I didn't realise this obvious fact until now
 BurnV06#5857: Cashew High Priest
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: people who become patrons also get to join voice chat and therefore get to watch CatCam when its on
 Dubomb#4455: It would be quite silly to make it turn based, but real time? Soooogood
 DrNukeLear#2414: Pecan Devotee?
 caibi#2508: What happen after the jam if I am not patroner
 Dubomb#4455: Yes (in real time)
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: they also get access to a bunch of other channels
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: correct!
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: there's no way of knowing
 Lawn#1538: Peanut Cultist?
 caibi#2508: Patroner can chat in server after jam?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: is nut cult better than Slammageddon?
 Dubomb#4455: Thanks for the game idea
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: its like watching a cult form in real time
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: this conversation is nuts
 AkariZero#2463: ahh I have started the nut puns meta of this conversation
 CALSYTHE#6648: some gamers pecan, some gamers pecant
 CALSYTHE#6648: cashew talking about?
 plopdapug2#6607: pecan gamers are the most oppressed minority
 BurnV06#5857: What about cashew gamers
 Dubomb#4455: Doubtful
 CALSYTHE#6648: we're all peanut gamers
 fizzledknight#8075: I too am a peanut gamer
 AkariZero#2463: was trying to do a PB&J sandwich joke haha
 caibi#2508: Peanut jam
 CALSYTHE#6648: Peanut Gamer?
 plopdapug2#6607: Game grandpa's ashes
 AkariZero#2463: Shouldn't it be Peanut Gamer and Game Jam?
 CALSYTHE#6648: Game mayo is where its at
 caibi#2508: game sugar
 fizzledknight#8075: Game Toast
 DrNukeLear#2414: Its when we move on to Game Wedge that we will be better.
 BurnV06#5857: Game mayonnaise
 Teslobo#8274: never
 CALSYTHE#6648: always game jam, but never game butter...  when we will evolve?
 AkariZero#2463: finishing work before doing D&D. Wrote a program simulating a gambling tournament tonight XD
 Teslobo#8274: I'm trying to stay a wake a bit longer to keep an eye on things
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: I will be at work on Friday lol
 AkariZero#2463: nope wide awake
 caibi#2508: but I think most of you, are sleeping?
 caibi#2508: well, morning  here
 Shrex#0584: ok thx
 caibi#2508: It all on the website
 Shrex#0584: what time does the game jam finish?
 caibi#2508: itch.io
 Hobusu#5033: It's all on the Jam's page on itch.io!
 ThePancakeKing#4241: Hey I'm wondering where I can find all the info for the game jam, like dates, and all that, can anyone help?
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Indeed, personal preference is important for such a quickly done project
 Commarchinin#4804: Yeah, plain SDL2 probably makes more sense ngl. But I'm a bit of a Lisp addict, and having my parens  `(this way round)` is worth the added complexity to me
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Hi!
 Olivia R#2924: 🥳🎉🛹🍕
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Indeed, am doing the same although with just plain SDL2
 Techno#1832: It's been a while since crossover jam hasn't it
 Jeker#3389: Cool
 tykenn#8548:  Hello!
 Techno#1832: Oh hi  didn't expect to see you here
 Commarchinin#4804: It's supported by emscripten which is a big part of why I'm using it - I can write stuff which compiles to C, then transpile it to JS/WASM and run the result in the browser without ever having to worry about the portability of my binaries
 Jeker#3389: Nice, i've only used sdl for software
 Commarchinin#4804: My plan for this game jam: Chicken Scheme + SDL2 compiled to WASM via emscripten. I've seen a stack of people doing 'wave function collapse' world gen in the last while, and to me it looks like a harder way of getting the same results you would get from logic programming. So I wanna try build some simple world-gen in miniKanren
 Jeker#3389: Pretty nice, used pretty much the same system lol, just used a png instead of an array
 AkariZero#2463: something like that. I had to use a different char for directional situations. If there's a column blocker I had to use 'c' or moving platform 'M' and 'm' to indicate the direction it's moving to
 Zeblackcat#4987: Ooh, tis open!
 Jeker#3389: So you had an array, itterated through that with like, 2 for loops, and coreesponded each char to a tile?
 d3v#9929: hi guys o/
 DriftWare.exe#9668: hhheeeyyyyyyyy
 AkariZero#2463: it allowed us to make multiple levels fast
 AkariZero#2463: yeah it was just making the levels via char values and the level editor just read them as either platforms or other things
 Jeker#3389: If you are saying what i think you are, thats pretty simple, cool non the less
 plopdapug2#6607: yea
 AkariZero#2463: for a class project I once made a level editor using Java and text files XD
 Jeker#3389: Yeah, what are you using btw?
 Nobody6502#8971: I'm kinda glad my engine has a level editor haha, much easier that way
 snuffysam#2767: (or the ace attorney character :p)
 Jeker#3389: Saw his level editor, tried to copy it, realised it didnt work in lua for some ungodly reason, made it work with an image instead of a string array
 brazmogu#3238: Yeah, making an engine is a lot easier when you have a game to run on top of it
 Nobody6502#8971: at this point I might just look for an artist and call it a day lol
 Jeker#3389: Yeah that would be kinda hard to do, without knowing what you are trying to do lol
 Nobody6502#8971: OH SNAP
a fellow floof connoisseur
 Jeker#3389: Oh
 brazmogu#3238: What I meant to do was more like a framework with some infrastructure ready (like, say, a screen stack, and object trees) but it's kind of hard to maintain focus without a clear design in mind
 Jarmister#8896:  same
 Nobody6502#8971: still no teammates 😐
 download.jpg#9532: i think most people think of the samuel becket play "waiting for godot" which is definitely a name, probably french like others said
 brazmogu#3238: Not as far as I understand, but I also stopped using GM when it became paid (so, GM6)so I could be very mistaken
 Jarmister#8896: just pluming around in the dark
 Jarmister#8896: I think about making game about droplet
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Already have a genre down and some ideas for the game... depending on what the actual theme is just making guesses
 Jeker#3389: Dont make anything too complicated, for example for the level editor, look at something like what dafluffypotato did
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Kinda feeling nostalgic for the jam
 Commarchinin#4804: Much more like Unity tbh, in terms of scope and method of interaction
 plopdapug2#6607: i can't understand them for the love of me
 Cass!#3031: it's similar to gamemaker right? or have I been misled
 Jarmister#8896: go dot sound like child of go and .net
 brazmogu#3238: I started doing that, too, but let's just say my second time trying to make abdn engine went as well as the first attempt
 Jeker#3389: Ironicly enough, nodes in Godot for me were really complicated
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: It will be a simple game, not much to it
 redka#6365: It does
 Cass!#3031: oh shit I didn't realize Godot did 3d
 redka#6365: Nodes in Godot are super easy
 plopdapug2#6607: like the objects
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Godot makes me think of Go, but Godot is in C++
 Jeker#3389: Oh nice, i once built an engine on top of love2d
 Commarchinin#4804: Perhaps people assume it's French, where the t would be silent
 Jarmister#8896: I updating godot maybe i play around with it this weekend
 plopdapug2#6607: i mean godot's nodes
 Cass!#3031: I kinda wanna check it out
 Lawn#1538: Flowlab looks like a node based engine.
 brazmogu#3238: Dear god
 plopdapug2#6607: i'm probably gonna try it out someday
 Cass!#3031: ohh I've heard good things about godot
 brazmogu#3238: Usually Godot, sometimes Love2D
 Roiboi#2055: why does everyone pronounce godot like "g'doh"
 creepinator45#7921: Unity's really nice to work in because of the amount of community stuff like assets, tutorials, and forum posts
 plopdapug2#6607: i can't figure out nodes
 Jarmister#8896: I have godot installed but i never use it
 Lawn#1538: All engines are valid folks (in the grand sense)
 Jarmister#8896:   why is that?
 plopdapug2#6607: i'm using a dumb engine called flowlab
 redka#6365: I love Godot and I hate all other engines (they are not Godot)
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: I am sticking with C11 and SDL2
 redka#6365: Im doing a thing in Godot
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: I am working alone, since I generally work with teams during my day job
 redka#6365: Why so many Poles here wtf
 Jarmister#8896: też polish
 redka#6365: Do you have someone for the jam yet?
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Ah nice
 redka#6365: I'm Polish
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Half Polish
 redka#6365: Oh my god Xer are you Polish
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Also another thing for the Jam you will probably want to do is setup Do not Disturb to reduce any distractions and otherwise, since if you are in the zone a single beep could bring you out of it
 redka#6365: Hi all
 creepinator45#7921: Oh cool
 creepinator45#7921: Where'd the link emoji package come from?
 Nobody6502#8971: yoo can't fault that
 creepinator45#7921: impossible
 Roiboi#2055: probably
 Roiboi#2055: i will now stop with my infantile sense of humor and do something productive
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Have been doing programming for 20 years, so definitely can skip all of the classes and just do the final
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: I would probably just ask to take a single test if it were possible and just skip it all
 AkariZero#2463: at least you can probably get a masters after showing years of experience without havint to go for BA
 Jeker#3389: Oh
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Continous Delivery, essentially every commit you deliver and deploy for the most part
 Jeker#3389: CD?
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Also setup CI/CD before hand and make sure your automated building and deployment works properly
 Roiboi#2055: that was my plan, but thanks for the reminder
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I would recommond you want you itch page made, your blank game engine project made with settings done, and your version controll set up before teh jam starts you want it to be all be tested and working correctly
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: I wanted to get one, but money was a big issue... but like I suppose on the long run no paying back student loans
 Jeker#3389: Oh, cool i like jetbrain's stuff, but i ended up writting my own text editor lol
 AkariZero#2463: yueah companies are realizing it's better to find other smart minds who just didn't want to go to school
 Jeker#3389: I mean, i know C++, but i am too bored to make a from-scratch-engine, so i just use Unity with a custom made level editor
 Roiboi#2055: ~~wait, that's only part of an engine!~~
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: If you have the money for JetBrains IDEs like IntelliJ, CLion, PyCharm, etc. there is Code With Me which works really nicely, can work on code together on the same screen
 davidnjihiahere#6326: I feel like there's a game engine for most languages. I've been discovering so many engines it's crazy
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Like Piston
 Roiboi#2055: yeah, but it was still a bit inconvenient for us to find out it was replaced *after* the jam started
~~then again that's probably just lack of preparation~~
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: There are yes
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Luckily though with open source stuff, more companies are allowing that to be used as an alternative to a degree which is nice.
 davidnjihiahere#6326: heard of bevy a lot
 Wormdas#5400: Hot take but Collaborate was terrible anyway
 Roiboi#2055: i bet some rustacean has made one
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Took 7 years for me, had finally gotten an exception
 creepinator45#7921: Out of curiosity, are there rust game engines?
 Roiboi#2055: well yeah but when unity collaborate was deprecated it applied to all versions since it was a service
 AkariZero#2463: *has a programmer degree and still took a year to find a job due to not getting an internship* -.-
 creepinator45#7921: but they depreciated their collaborate system across all versions I believe
And required plastic scm
 Wormdas#5400: You know you're not like, legally required to update Unity
 Roiboi#2055: *cough* plastic scm *cough*
 AkariZero#2463: yeah sometimes you just need the degree to prove it to some people. Note you also need the internships too from what I've learned
 Roiboi#2055: which is very reliable and never has features deprecated at the most inconvenient times
 Jeker#3389: C++ is like, so bloated with garbage
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: I would recommend leaving at least 4 hours for exporting and uploading your game
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: I do already have the knowledge, it does suck being rejected for jobs since I lack one despite scoring if not the highest on their tests
 NotQuiteCool#8511: Unity, because I've been learning it this year
 Jeker#3389: Nice
 AkariZero#2463: Because of the programmers Godot with C# Mono
 Jeker#3389: Oh, nice, always liked C more than C++
 AkariZero#2463: depends on if you feel like you aleady have the knowledge. The smartest programmer on my team does not have a degree
 creepinator45#7921: unity
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: C11
 Jeker#3389: Cool, C++?
 davidnjihiahere#6326: I use TIC-80
 Roiboi#2055: or is that just me
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Custom from scratch
 Jeker#3389: What engine you guys using btw?
 Roiboi#2055: does anyone else do team jams and just end up with everyone being awake way too late and you can only either talk about how much there is left to do or make a self deprecating joke
 AkariZero#2463: my plans for Friday
1) Work with team on possible design for game
2) Work with the artist and figure out feasible game mechanics while my Australian programmer sleeps
3) Work on prototype with entire team until sleep time.
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: I do sometimes wonder if I should go to school and get a degree despite managing to get a few jobs without one
 snuffysam#2767: well, that depends on how many hours you have on friday & sunday in your own timezone :p
i'm gonna have to start bug testing on saturday in my timezone, since we only have half a day on sunday instead of a full day
 BurnV06#5857: Here’s my schedule (feel free to use if you want):
Hour 0-8 : Program framework/ basic mechanics
Hour 8-17 : Sleep
Hour 17-32 : Add supplementary mechanics, implement graphics and sound, make levels
Hour 32-41 : Sleep more
Hour 41-46 : Polish, Bugfix, Add more levels
Hour 46-47 : Upload to itch.io and make page
NOTE: Extra hour left on purpose to give room for error
 AkariZero#2463: yeah this was for my first degree that didn't mattered but felt like I still needed to graduate
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Was like the most complicated code I wrote while sleep deprived
 Tyrix#6647: i know the feeling D: ... i got my masters degree last year
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: I wrote a navigational mesh made up of convex polygons for AI navigation then went to bed at around 05:30 once I noticed the sun was shining on my monitor
 Teslobo#8274: legend has it that if you program for too long in one sitting your socks just consume you outright
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Sleep, eat, rest, work. Generally we say use the Friday for planning/prototype, Saturday do the work get the game made, Sunday bug fix and polish. Give yourself at least 6 hours to finish and upload
 AkariZero#2463: sometimes I look at the code I written for myself from the past and yell out, "PAST JIM!!!!"
 Jeker#3389: And, to make it worse it was like string manipulation stuff in C
 Jeker#3389: I remember seeing the code i wrote at like, 5 am
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Definitely do not stay up until 05:00 only to wake up and figure out what the hell you were doing the whole night
 AkariZero#2463: Except for graduation in my case...never again will I write 34 pages in two nights...
 Tyrix#6647: honestly my games got better once i prepared some food in advance and slept enough. trying to work 48h straight will not bring you anywhere!
 Teslobo#8274: by all memes
 Roiboi#2055: i'm taking this meme
 AkariZero#2463: that's fair. My friend and I program together when necessary but otherwise try not to collide branches
 Wormdas#5400: If you want to become progressively worse at programming, more aggravated, aggressive, and difficult to be around for no reason, by all means, don't sleep.
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Death is for day jobs
 Teslobo#8274: have fun, don't die
 snuffysam#2767: my team is ready! just me and a musician, but should be enough for the scope we're going for.
honestly this might be the team i'm most confident in of all the jam teams i've done, given the conversations we've had & what i've seen of his work
 Ellis#1417: Definitely
 Scolon#4218: lol
 Teslobo#8274: that goes for pretty much anyone. Do not ruin yourself over a for-fun game jam
 Jeker#3389: Nah lol, he is a friend, we just hate co-op programming so i am taking over, cause i guess i am the better programmer from what he says
 K'miinik#3171: I just vaguely know that I wanna make a card game, I'll figure out the specifics once I see the theme
 PlayToTroll#4277: that's good
 AkariZero#2463: Don't worry. I know his partner, she'll make him sleep
 PlayToTroll#4277: nah won't do that
 AkariZero#2463: I'm always weary of those guys. You look away and suddenly they're jump kicking everyone
 Wormdas#5400: Please sleep during the jam.
 Teslobo#8274: If he's gunna do that make sure you take care of him
 Jeker#3389: My team is, a programmer (me) an artist a composer and a guy who is just there lol
 NotQuiteCool#8511: Aim to have a working, if ugly, game done in a day. Whenever you watch devlogs from Jams, the best games are the ones that have a core mechanic, a win states and a lose state in day one, and can use day two with polishing
 PlayToTroll#4277: lol
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: just remember its a game design challenge. get your itch page and your tools ready to go but don't plan anything before the jam starts, let the theme actually allow you to come up with something that's the whole point.
The spirit of the jam is to hear the theme and create an idea not to take some previous ideas and hope they fit.
Of course you'll probably pull pieces from previous ideas in, thats normal, but don't take a whole idea and use it as is
 AkariZero#2463: sorry XD we're probably good on programmers. One of the programmers is so smart and can work without sleep so well that we swear he's a robot.
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: I plan on starting with 2 levels, a tutorial and a normal level... then build more levels as time goes on
 PlayToTroll#4277: If you were missing a programmer I would've joined xD
 K'miinik#3171: definitely gonna try and get a smaller scope for this one
 snuffysam#2767: "Josuke! You'll never escape the power of my... Downwell's Duel Purpose Mechanic!"
 AkariZero#2463: my team and I are ready. 1 artist/programmer, 3 programmers (including me) we're just missing a sound guy XD
 NotQuiteCool#8511: That was me last year. It's a wonderful experience
 K'miinik#3171: I've done a few, and have dissapointed myself almost every time, lol
 PlayToTroll#4277: Nice I wish you good luck at it
 AkariZero#2463: this is my first real attempt at a game jam
 Jarmister#8896: Honestly theme names sound like Jojo bizarre adventure's stands
 AkariZero#2463: I'm excited to see what comes up soon!
 Jarmister#8896: soft and wet
 Jeker#3389: I have like, 10 ideas, one of them will fit right?
 BurnV06#5857: “Two in one”
 AffordableNature#8310: thanks so much!
 snuffysam#2767: dang what was your guess?
 Teslobo#8274: Welcome
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: I am doing the same, I have some ideas on the board to potentially go with depending on the theme and how close it is
 AffordableNature#8310: heyyy yaaalll!!
 Tyrix#6647: i will for sure post all ideas i found, which i didn't use myself again. people were so happy just having a starting point ^^
 BurnV06#5857: I’ve been practicing coming up with ideas by thinking what the theme could be and coming up with ideas for that. Last year one of my practice ones was almost bang on so I basically used a modified version of that idea.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: When the theme does drop you often find a bunch of people just flinging ideas around for people to use as they see fit as well so don't stress about coming up with something
 plopdapug2#6607: ook ook
 Teslobo#8274: monkey
 snuffysam#2767: tbh i'd have an easier time making a pac-man clone than an E.T. for atari clone
 snuffysam#2767: i could probably make something... *similar* to an old arcade game in two days in unity
like someone could reasonably develop the first level of donkey kong, idk about the rest of the game
 Jeker#3389: But she is doing the art for it, so its not stealing lol
 snuffysam#2767: i think if you use the default packages from unity or unreal, you could probably make a decent single-player FPS in two days
check them out first to see if you have a hard time using them
i would definitely not recommend a multiplayer one though lmao
 plopdapug2#6607: this is basically people thinking that old arcade games are simple to make
 BurnV06#5857: Well I’m going to make like a full commercial product I would release on steam
 Jeker#3389: I have so many cool ideas for the jam, and they are all my girlfriend's ideas lol
 Teslobo#8274: comprehensive state machine 👌
 NotQuiteCool#8511: ~~It's just running and shooting. That's just two things~~
 Wormdas#5400: It's just a really bad idea
 wyrm_slayr#7477: That's too easy. You should make an MMORPG with clans and multi-classing instead
 Jarmister#8896:   don't forget about theme
 Wormdas#5400: It can be done
 BurnV06#5857: I probably wouldn’t be able to make it in 48 hours tho
 plopdapug2#6607: bruh
 snuffysam#2767: i'm ready to make an online multiplayer team class-based FPS in two days
 Jarmister#8896: true
 NotQuiteCool#8511: Maybe the theme will be lasers, and you'll have the perfect opportunity
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Timesplitters 2 is amazing ❤️
 plopdapug2#6607: i'l test it out!
 BurnV06#5857: I’ve been wanting to make an fps based on laser tag, but I have never made a 3d game so yeah
 Jeker#3389: Oh, if you have problems with it, try installing a performance config
 snuffysam#2767: y'know, i'm not sure if i stayed on overwatch longer than i did on tf2 or not
i think i played overwatch for longer?
 plopdapug2#6607: i like overwatch it's just dumb fun
 Teslobo#8274: I have TF2 in the same mental box as SSB Melee. That being "it's a horrible broken game but it gets a pass on being very charming and community-driven"
 NotQuiteCool#8511: I'm a personal fan of Timesplitters 2
 plopdapug2#6607: it's pretty fun when it runs decently for me
 BurnV06#5857: I would download tf2 but my PC is out of space. Probably gonna get a sd card
 Jeker#3389: I think tf2 is honestly the best fps game ever
 snuffysam#2767: if the ship's sinking, i'm at least glad the band is staying in tune
 Teslobo#8274: it is now just stock but worse
 Jeker#3389: Just as i get it for the hibox...lol
 Teslobo#8274: actually
 Teslobo#8274: they just haven't given it to TF2
 Jeker#3389: Wait actually?
 Teslobo#8274: There's been an anticheat update that effectively does this that CSGO's been using for years
 K'miinik#3171: tf2 isn't very well optimized out the gate, and the hats don't really help that
 plopdapug2#6607: my pc is too bad for tf2 yet it still runs portal 2 perfectly
 BurnV06#5857: Imho they could probably use code to detect if there’s any program altering the client side inputs and then kick them if so
 snuffysam#2767: i mean patches are better than no patches
 plopdapug2#6607: they #saved tf2
 Teslobo#8274: same. I was like 2010-2013 then came back last year
 snuffysam#2767: i played TF2 right after it became f2p i believe
it was pretty fun, i dropped off of it after a little while tho
 K'miinik#3171: Out of like the 15 servers I've joined recently, only one or two had any bots
 Teslobo#8274: they fixed the iron bomber hitbox yesterday
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Also TF2 is from like 2006/2007
 K'miinik#3171: yeah
 Teslobo#8274: they've outsourced bugfixes apparently and patches have been rolling out like crazy
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: I was in the TF2 beta before all this trading and loot stuff existed, it is weird how different of a game it is
 plopdapug2#6607: the new kirby is also pretty fun
 BurnV06#5857: I’m gonna start playing tf2 once Valve fixes the bot problem
 K'miinik#3171: it honestly hasn't been too bad recently
 SlamBamActionman#7160: *Sniper with default cosmetics looking straight up intensifies*
 Tyrix#6647: i can watch opus magnum solution loops for hours. it is so satisfying!
 Teslobo#8274: Me too. I got sucked into trading for a while and...
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: I used to make games but stopped many years ago, rather fell out of interest for them
 plopdapug2#6607: same except for journey since i never played it
 BurnV06#5857: Yeah Celeste is really good
 creepinator45#7921: Big fan of Hollow knight, celeste, journey
 K'miinik#3171: I've been playing team fortress 2
 hal#0125: 🚨 banger alert 🚨
 snuffysam#2767: nice
you're in for a real treat, portal 2 is arguably the best game ever made?
 plopdapug2#6607: wheatley is my son and i will protect him at all costs
 brazmogu#3238: also Immortals Fenyx Rising which is scratching my Breath of the Wild itches perfectly
 Jeker#3389: Nice, imo Glados is the best villain lol
 plopdapug2#6607: on pc
 BurnV06#5857: I recently replayed Ocarina of Time for the first time since my childhood, and beat it for the first time
 Tyrix#6647: you are in for a treat!
 brazmogu#3238: I love that question because I can pick from dozens of options each time anyone asks me
so this time I've been back into Zachtronics games, focusing on Opus Magnum at the time
 unityAccount#7810: My favourite games are Hollow Knight and Cuphead (both of which I have never played😅)
 snuffysam#2767: nice, what platform?
 plopdapug2#6607: yep
 obsesivamente#9100: Portal, the best tutorial ever made ❤️
 plopdapug2#6607: i just started portal 2 for the first time
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: I just play Minecraft Bedrock whenever I play games, or otherwise have been sort of playing Baldur's Gate 3
 snuffysam#2767: i've been replaying Portal recently
 plopdapug2#6607: celeste
 BurnV06#5857: So, what games do you guys like? (Tryna help the mods to redirect the topic)
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Sorry, will not suggest a solution for it
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Move on from this topic please
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: So like if you use Launch4j, Java should be within the rules
 Kira#7896: The thing about Arsenal is they always try to walk it in.
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Check out http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/ for wrapping Jars to executables, you can include a JRE
 Roiboi#2055: alright
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: tough, do it somewhere else or pick a different topic
 MrBen#0001: YES IT IS! Thank you for godly 15 secs!
 brazmogu#3238: oh, dang, and here I am making mobile games for a living and planning to make games in my free time
 creepinator45#7921: yes
 hal#0125: anyone see that ludicrous display last night
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: It's fine, you don't have to tell the mods what to do, we know our options and will use them as we nee necessary.
 Roiboi#2055: ~~aww but it's fun to be pedantic~~
 hal#0125: so
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Slam is a moderator and has asked that the Roblox conversation end. Please end it now. You all have options of other things you can use and other jams that allow its use.
Move on.
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Java is not really an issue since standalone Jar packages exist and have existed for a long time, Minecraft does it that way
 Cass!#3031: oh that's neat!
 Roiboi#2055: i'm not sure if that's possible, since all roblox games run on their own servers.
maybe you could theoretically make that, but it might be easier to create an entire engine from scratch at that point.
 brazmogu#3238: you can also publish games outside of a jam, and I'm sure there are youtubers that showcase games made for specific engines
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Regardless of whether it is possible, you likely do not have distributing rights to the Roblox client.
 Teslobo#8274: I think there's a potential blurred line about whether the jammer is presenting the roblox client as their game, with a level file tacked on
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: They can join any other jam that allows the use of roblox. This one specific jam does not. You have PLENTY of options:
http://www.indiegamejams.com
 hal#0125: for £14.99 they'll post you components and a breadboard
 snuffysam#2767: in other jams i've been in, there were people who put out games that required like, a specific version of python & a command line thing to run?
it was really sad seeing them not get any ratings, i honestly wish there was someone to tell them not to do that
 brazmogu#3238: but you can have a game jam that allows Roblox games and other similar engines, tho
you also have to consider the amount of work that would be, and that a lot of people would not be willing to play the games if they can't just download and run it
 Squishy Turtle#3988: This is a very popular game jam therefore the rules should be the way I want is a pretty strange train of thought
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: I mean you could clone Roblox in 48 hours just enough to run your Jam creation
 SlamBamActionman#7160: 1. There are many alternatives to Roblox available, it's not a very strict rule.
2. There are tons and tons of jams out there! GMTK is not the only one. Check out itch.io, they host a large number and some might meet your criteria 🙂
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: To quote the exact rule again, which applies to java and everything else ```
You must produce a digital computer game, that runs on Windows - or web browsers supported by Windows. You can support additional platforms  if you like, but a Windows / browser build is necessary.
The game file needs to be uploaded to itch.io when you submit.
You can not require the user to download additional software from external sources  they should be included in the download and not require separate installation).
```
 NotQuiteCool#8511: There are lots of Roblox-specific jams
 creepinator45#7921: Could a roblox dev package an entire roblox client with their game?
 K'miinik#3171: how
 Reditect#3626: yeah, but the issue isn't just Roblox. Other people are affected, not just me. Many people all around the world are deprived of an opportunity here. And people follow this jams rules because it's popular so I can't really go anywhere else to put my games out there or have a game-jam.
 brazmogu#3238: you can pack a Java game in a way that won't require an installation, so yes
 tykenn#8548: Teams are great when you have time, because you can be more ambitious with the variety of skills. But for short jams, it's always hard to get the ball rolling and not spend a whole day just trying to agree on one idea. By myself, I can just roll with whatever dumb idea pops into my head and nobody can tell me no.
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: I work for a medical company doing doctor facing systems in hospitals and clinics
 SlamBamActionman#7160: I don't know java development specifics, but if you can't pack it into the itch.io download, it's not allowed.
 creepinator45#7921: Hmm, fair point
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: You could package a JRE with the JAR and run it standalone
 Cass!#3031: ohhh cool, what team do you work with?
 brazmogu#3238: and Disney Infinity games
 creepinator45#7921: On the topic of the roblox debate, would a game made in java be allowed? It seems like the answer would be no because java requires jre
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Sorry Reditect but I think it's best the discussion about Roblox is cut off here. If you could manage to get Roblox to comply with the GMTK rules, great! But as stated they rules are pretty clear-cut on that no *external* downloads are allowed, and requiring people to go to Roblox's website and download a client is exactly that.
It has nothing to do with Roblox specifically, it just happens that Roblox is that way.
Dota 2 is free, so if we were to allow Roblox games we'd have to allow custom Dota 2 mods. It just does not scan.
 BurnV06#5857: And Dreams games
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Well, I suppose I am really working solo because 40 hours every week of the year I work with a team and it is kind of nice just going at it alone at times
 brazmogu#3238: "Here's a Docker container, your game must run in this machine or else"
 Kira#7896: The TTT people are super cool.
 snuffysam#2767: yeah it also bans Little Big Planet games and Game Builder Garage games
 unityAccount#7810: Good idea👀
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Considering I work on a team at work with deadlines, I am going solo with deadlines... different kind of pace
 brazmogu#3238: I think you're getting too hung up that Roblox has been specified as the example, it's just a very popular and well known example of what's being said, is all
 K'miinik#3171: technically, since there is no team size limit, it would be possible for everyone to be working together on a single project
 creepinator45#7921: same
 BurnV06#5857: Tbh I plan on doing it entirely by myself
 Roiboi#2055: it's an interesting argument though
 Roiboi#2055: oh this is more of fun speculation than actual clarification, i have no plans to inconvenience myself for the sake of a loophole
 Tyrix#6647: yeah, i have talked to so many people last year, because they were nervous about searching for a team.
 Reditect#3626: Why is this legitimately a rule though? I see no reason for this to be a thing other than for it to be discriminatory. If someone didn't want to do those steps, then it should be that persons individual choice. I'm fine with getting less people to play with my games because I know I can't do anything about that. I can't change peoples minds, but people follow what you guys do. People put down the same rules because they see it as the norm without considering who it affects. This is one of many opportunities that I can't be apart of simply because I use Roblox and I think that's a little scuffed.
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Also, you can get a handful of amazing individual developers that are not cohesive or work well in a team setting
 snuffysam#2767: as i mentioned before, i once saw a team that worked developing *for* unreal engine in a jam, and they didn't finish their project
funny enough it was kind of the opposite problem, where they were all really close friends just messing around and they didn't really spend much time working on what was presumably their days off
 K'miinik#3171: me
 BurnV06#5857: Plus some people (like me) have social anxiety which makes group work not the best for them
 Squishy Turtle#3988: Very true. We had swagshaw the guy behind two Timin towers for our team lead. He’s amazing
 NotQuiteCool#8511: Better chance if there's a tie-breaker football game to decide the winner though
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: And some emulators can be built on emscripten
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: the rule is that it can't require people to install third party software to run and that it needs to be uploaded to itch.io so again being pedantic isn't actually useful
 wren#0640: more chance of infighting over conflicting ideas too
 Kira#7896: The bigger the team, the more coordination and decision making.
 unityAccount#7810: Unluckily, yes. But I think it would be much better focusing on a small, super polished project instead
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: I mean there is emscripten based builds of RetroArch that you could technically bundle together with a built-in core and single ROM
 Roiboi#2055: i guess in that sense steam *is* a third party server.
would itch.io then be a third party server as well? maybe, although it *is* where the game jam is held, so i wouldn't exactly say that.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: and the more people the more unruley and difficult to manage
 BurnV06#5857: Oof so close
 Tobius Saint#5706: i was in a team of 4 and we got #203
 NotQuiteCool#8511: The bigger the chance for miscommunication
 K'miinik#3171: So there is a way to have gba roms playable in the itch.io browser, I think that would qualify, yeah?
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: The bigger the team the bigger the scope
 wren#0640: being able to coordinate so many people
 NotQuiteCool#8511: I was a team of two and came 109 🤷‍♂️
 wren#0640: i think one of the top 20 was a 10+ team last year? but honestly thats kinda insane in its own right
 hal#0125: im sure next year they'll have a hardware specification rather than a rules list just to avoid this discussion again
 TetrisKid48#3138: as long as it's html5 it's fine
 Squishy Turtle#3988: Yeah we had 14 and placed in the mid 300s. Yet more proof that bigger team != better game
 Tobius Saint#5706: oh dam, my bad. could have sworn a lot more of the top spots were big teams, i remeber a comment about it on the streams and the video that game out shortly after
 brazmogu#3238: you have to be *really* specific to make a game that only runs in one specific browser, tbh
 snuffysam#2767: is there a windows version of safari? i guess there probably is tbh
 TetrisKid48#3138: yeah
 BurnV06#5857: Not safari
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Internet Explorer 6?
 TetrisKid48#3138: "web browsers supported by Windows" i guess any
 Dragonite#5414: In my opinion goal of game jams is to have fun making the game not where it places
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Which browser is being used?
 Teslobo#8274: quoting the rules so there's no room for ambiguity or pedantry:
```You must produce a digital computer game, that runs on Windows - or web browsers supported by Windows. You can support additional platforms  if you like, but a Windows / browser build is necessary.
The game file needs to be uploaded to itch.io when you submit.
You can not require the user to download additional software from external sources  they should be included in the download and not require separate installation). ```
 brazmogu#3238: absolutely
 snuffysam#2767: Also literally the top 5 last year were all solo developers
and 12 of the top 20
 Kira#7896: I remember one team of 12 people (I think it was Squishy's team). Which others had that many?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: If you make your game available to Mac and Linux users, you are a Cool Person however
 wren#0640: its always a good idea to build for other os if you can though :)
 Tobius Saint#5706: eh, true
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: you don't have t make your game available to mac to comply with the jam rules
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Working just fine on Safari
 NotQuiteCool#8511: This is mostly for the fun of making a game
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Not really because the rules say it must being playable on a windows computer either via download or in browser
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: WebGL should work just fine on Mac
 NotQuiteCool#8511: I mean, you don't really win anything except seeing your game on a video in the top 100
 wren#0640: webgl works on all major os iirc
 Roiboi#2055: huh, wonder why i heard so much that they didn't
 snuffysam#2767: they do in fact work on mac
 brazmogu#3238: that is a pointless argument considering that the requirement, as far as I remember, is that it has to be playable *on Windows*
 Roiboi#2055: to be fair, you could make the argument that games that use webgl shouldn't qualify since they only work on windows and not mac computers
 Paytonio#5712: Good evening guys
 Tobius Saint#5706: not every single one, but a good chunk were professional teams of many people
 Crostzard#7475: in order to put a game on steam you would have to pay 100$ meaning its probably pre-made
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Games need to be distributed via the itch.io website, Steam games are hosted outside of it and do not qualify
 unityAccount#7810: Common sense usually is enough to make the difference when it comes to the grey areas
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: No, teams can be any size. General advice suggests no more than 4 strangers working together.
 snuffysam#2767: If I release a .exe file from Unity that is playable on windows
To my knowledge, there is literally nothing Unity can do that can remove the file off the computers of the people that downloaded it, and there's nothing Unity as a company can do to stop someone from running that .exe file I released.
Same with a webgl version on itch's servers, Unity can't do anything about it
If I release a game that runs in Roblox
What is stopping the developers of Roblox of, on the 18th, going "every single person who plays Roblox now has to have a paid $1000 account"
making it so none of the judges can play my game
yes, *windows* or *itch* could release an update that makes my Unity game unplayable, but notably, Unity could not. Which is what makes Unity an engine that lets you release games, and what makes Roblox a platform where you can create games
 Kira#7896: Hi!
 SlamBamActionman#7160: It's very simple, you choose to make it sound like it's not.
 creepinator45#7921: Would you allow games posted to steam for the game jam?
 Squishy Turtle#3988: Kira!
 wren#0640: new rule: no operating systems allowed
 Kira#7896: Huh? Not everyone had a huge team. But TBH, if you can manage a 12+ person team in a jam more power to ya.
 K'miinik#3171: kinda, but a gba game would also not apply because you'd need an emulator
 Teslobo#8274: There's still no team limits
 creepinator45#7921: I'm just saying, it's not so simple. There's always some grey area
 Roiboi#2055: i would say it's not about third party *software* so much as third party *servers*
 SlamBamActionman#7160: While yes, Windows is software, it is an operating system. You are being technically correct in the most pointless of ways, so you're not getting that "gotcha" you're looking for 😛
 Roiboi#2055: huh
dedication
 Tobius Saint#5706: are we doing something about the team size for this years game jam? it was no coincidence every one in the top 100 were 12+ people teams
 creepinator45#7921: yes
 Teslobo#8274: next year we're going to have someone make a pen and paper game and the itch.io page is a link to their twitch where they run the game for people in chat
 creepinator45#7921: so really it's just where you draw the line of people already having access to the third party software
 Roiboi#2055: wait where's the leaf icon
...did you stay in this server since the last game jam?
 Roiboi#2055: All of the roblox games are run on roblox's servers, wheras games made with game engines don't rely on third party servers for functionality
 NotQuiteCool#8511: I don't know about the quality of games, but Roblox is terrible for many other reasons
 creepinator45#7921: lol
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: What.. r u.. ok
 creepinator45#7921: But isn't windows third party software? any .exe file is arguably not standalone either. For a file to be truly standalone it would need to run directly on the hardware, without an operating system
 wren#0640: can i make my game in 68000 assember pretty please
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Monkey mind moment
 NalaFala38290#9305: it's technically turing-complete
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Have those hits never played Cuphead
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Roblox games are not stand-alone, which breaks the requirement for the jam.
You ultimately do not own the Roblox client. Someone who has made a Unity project does not own Unity or have written all the underlying code, but they can claim ownership of the files that they distribute.* Since you can't distribute the Roblox client, it breaks the jam requirements.
*Exceptions and stuff apply, obviously
 Ayden#0303: yeah
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: The graphing software?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Yes. And that is also a requirement, the game needs to be playable on Windows 😛
 Ayden#0303: can desmos be considered a game engine 🤔
 Reditect#3626: The reputation of a corporation also shouldn't be a reason. Other engines make decisions, but that doesn't mean all the devs agree with them. Recently there was an issue on twitter where gamers were saying games were bad because they were made with Unity. The game-dev community responded by saying it doesn't matter what engine you use, so why should Roblox be different from that. If it doesn't matter, why do people assume Roblox games are gonna be terrible? It's reputation, but that's not my reputation so yeah idk.
 creepinator45#7921: but couldn't you make the argument that .exe files require you to have the third party software called windows?
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Or NES Tetris
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: That should count because it's fuckin epic.
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Lol unless you do what that one guy did(the guy who remade Pokemon red)
 snuffysam#2767: Yeah I think a fundamental feature of a "game development application" as opposed to a "game engine that other people can make games in" is that you can export an executable for a system, not for the game
You couldn't distribute a Minecraft world folder and call that an executable game either
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: I miss 2012-2016 so much..
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: They have. It's kinda sad because I see a lot of that stuff get overshadowed by lazy copypastas that date call themselves video games
 brazmogu#3238: to be fair, that's true of pretty much every design tool or moddable engine, e.g. Mario Maker and Little Big Planet
 Ahat#0842: great explanation
 wren#0640: still not appropriate for this jam really but its not any less of a game engine
 Teslobo#8274: It's quite impressive what some people can do with it. I went to their developer conference and was equally amazed by the creative talent and disgusted by the corporate talent
 Ahat#0842: hello
 SlamBamActionman#7160: On a Roblox client, yes?
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: You can download the .rblx file and run it
 wren#0640: people have done some insane stuff in it
 brazmogu#3238: can Roblox export a .exe file that can be run right out of Windows? Because I think that's the point
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Never seen the game at all
 wren#0640: roblox studio is actually quite fleshed out honestly from what ive seen
 SlamBamActionman#7160: When you can make a Roblox game as a stand-alone application that'll fit in an itch.io upload, similar to RPGMaker or the like. At least that'd be a start, I suppose
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: No never relate Roblox to scratch.
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Ah
 Teslobo#8274: Roblox has built-in multiplayer. A singleplayer roblox game is relatively rare as a result
 Tyrix#6647: a game making tool with some questionable business practices targeted at children
 brazmogu#3238: they'll never let you compete in a jam again
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: It used to be good, now it's just gay 7yr olds spamming daddy chill in chat while playing annoying simulator games
 Reditect#3626: fair point. There are tons of reasons as to why I can't use Roblox, but I can't exactly do anything about those issue. I could send a studio file as an entry, but that'd also be a hassle. I'd like to know everything stopping me though so that I could work with Roblox to change that.
 brazmogu#3238: you win all the jams, then, by default
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: So like scratch
 SlamBamActionman#7160: It's not that it's roblox, it's that it's third-party software. We don't allow games that require you to download a one-time use DLL or anything similar either.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: What if... I made my own roblox, for the game jam, and then made my actual game jam game inside of the roblox game that I made during the jam?
 Teslobo#8274: A game where you make and publish games for others to play
 Scolon#4218: I'm gonna make a game
 wren#0640: its an itch.io based gamejam and you cant upload roblox games to itch so like
 brazmogu#3238: do not gatekeep
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: What actually is Roblox?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Roblox requires third-party software, it's as easy as that
 Dragonite#5414: 2 at a stretch
 Reditect#3626: You only have to download the Roblox client, nothing else. After the first install, you don't download anything. There are updates to the Roblox client, but yeah.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Is it you? Lol.
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: CHAD: Knows all the c languages, Java, mocha, python and mcfunction.
VIRGIN: "Roblox counts as a game development platform UwU and people should consider it a game engine"
 Kira#7896: I bet you at least one person is gonna make a game about making a game for this jam.
 brazmogu#3238: although, no, that sounds kind of too much
 wren#0640: thats what i was planning to do
 brazmogu#3238: Games about programming; Zachlikes
 wren#0640: i sure hope not
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I bet you at least one person is gonna make a game for this jam.
 brazmogu#3238: because then you need to download two things? I suspect it'd be the same if you submitted a Gameboy ROM...
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: This year's theme is definitely going to be developing a game
 Teslobo#8274: effectively giving a theoretical jammer hours of extra time
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I need the second
 Teslobo#8274: it tells you the day, not the time
 Reditect#3626: It tells you on the game page when the game was last updated.
 brazmogu#3238: as for Roblox, I suspect that's simply because you can't create a self-playing binary out of it?
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Ikr
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Several people are typing...
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: I did definitely setup my second desk lol
 Kira#7896: Hi!
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Hi!
 Kira#7896: Roblox is an external site, too. There is no way to stop people updating their games during voting.
 brazmogu#3238: this is neat
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: All my friends are here.
 Kira#7896: Hello!
 brazmogu#3238: oh, hey, this channel exploded
hi, everyone o/
 Reditect#3626: Why would you want to download a game normally off of the itch page? Most games don't have an in-browser player. Why should that standard be different simply because it's Roblox?
 snuffysam#2767: Why would I want to download Roblox to play a game?
 Reditect#3626: Yeah, I get that, but there's a reason for Roblox having that and I can't change that. The reason is exploiters ruining games without a way to ban them. I've already spoken with the CEO about changing the need for an account, but they don't plan to remove that. As a developer, my hands are tied if I want to use Roblox.
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: previously, games that required a bunch of installs and extra hoops to be jumped through simply didn't get played
 Techno#1832: I come back to at least 140 messages every time lol
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Yeah the reasoning is we want to lower the barrier to actually being able to play people's games as much as possible
 Crostzard#7475: the judge would have to create a roblox account
 Tyrix#6647: i think Roblox applications dont run on their own, but require Roblox. This would be against the rules
 Crostzard#7475: oh, its because you cant put the game on itchio
 NotQuiteCool#8511: It's because roblox requires a player to have something extra, like a roblox account
 Reditect#3626: I was told this: "The desire of this jam is for people to be able to download a single file from a single website (itch.io) and for it to work."
 Reditect#3626: apparently not.
 Crostzard#7475: you cant use roblox here?
 Reditect#3626: This is a little old, but I'd like to challenge this idea. I personally started using Unity and then switched to Roblox Studio for many reasons. Speaking on the topic of Roblox, wouldn't not letting people use Roblox as their engine of choice be discriminatory? Why should what I use matter? Sure, I now know Unreal and already know how to use Unity, but why can't I use Roblox.
 unityAccount#7810: Nice👍
 unityAccount#7810: 😅 Good point.  I was thinking of a single channel for everything but that's pretty cool too
 Tyrix#6647: look out for pinned messages. i don't think there are any yet, but i remember last year resources were collected there
 snuffysam#2767: nothing stopping you from sharing a link to a sound resource in sound-help
 snuffysam#2767: there are three arguably?
 unityAccount#7810: Would be nice if there was a channel to share game dev resources🤔
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Sounds good to me!
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: I think that sounds fine, but if things pick up again the mod helpers can move it back up to 30
 hal#0125: sleep tight
 DomG#9983: gn
 dardasaba#9759: Nice! 🤣
Go get them bugs!
Anyways I'm off to bed, good night!
 DomG#9983: 3 XSS vulnerabilities and a bunch of other smaller ones
 DomG#9983: been doing bug bounties on newgrounds for a few days now
 Teslobo#8274: a ping? Mark did an @ everyone to let them know the server is open again for the jam
 Keniak1G9#8949: why was there a pin?
 Teslobo#8274: it's also a Friday. Americans may still be at school/work for the most part and haven't joined at all yet
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: there's dips and stuff based on timezones etc
 Tyrix#6647: don't worry, it will come back, lol
 gamedevperson#8448: rip chat
 wyrm_slayr#7477: ah
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: you may be able to in hype
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: you don't if you're not a patron
 gamedevperson#8448: you cant in this server
 wyrm_slayr#7477: Dang it. How do I properly embed GIFs?
 Steven#5431:  hey, nice to see you in here 😮
 gamedevperson#8448: embed fail 😔
 wyrm_slayr#7477: That second part is quite the assumption...
:P
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: you've made the joke, people laughed, move on
 LM#4371: alr
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Stop now. Seriously
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Yeah but be careful because our job is to make sure things are clear and some newpeople might not know you are being sarcastic. We're fine with people making jokes but a lot of times they aren't se we have to respond to be sure
 LM#4371: theme is still Mark Brown tho
 NotQuiteCool#8511: There's a reason the rule even has to exist
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: in previous years people have made mark-themed games thinking they were being really funny when they were actually just being really weird
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: A lot of people *aren't* sarcastic about doing that is the issue! got to make the rules clear
 wyrm_slayr#7477: Lol
 nakst#1416: I thought the key to successful game design was to break all the rules? (you know I am being sarcastic, right? :P)
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: For real, respect people's boundries. Do NOT put references to Mark or the mods into your game
 Tyrix#6647: yes, but to show you have made the game for the jam, and not as "game element" i suppose
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: use of the GMTK branding is totally cool however
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: I can guarantee that not only does a bunch of references to mark specifically annoy him (and the rest of us), it'll ensure he'll never actually play your game
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: then your game will not be valid as it breaks the jam rules
 NotQuiteCool#8511: You can, however, use the GMTK logo, right?
 nakst#1416: as soon as I read that rule it became my personal mission to cram as many Mark references into my jam game as physically possible 😈
 LM#4371: The theme is still Mark Brown you cant do anything about it
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Do not put references to Mark, the mods, or GMTK into your game
 Dric#2439: put him as an easter egg, not directly
 LM#4371: Mark Brown
 Cameron#7818: That's against the rules.
 LM#4371: Theme is Mark Brown
 NotQuiteCool#8511: Unless everyone rejects that first idea and no-one does it
 wyrm_slayr#7477: But what if "the literal approach" is the theme?
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: also probably reject the first idea you have because literally 300 other people will have had the same idea
 DrNukeLear#2414: Very clever. Thanks for pointing that out.
 Mark Brown#6982: While the themes might initially sound like they refer to mechanics (Out of Control = controller, Joined Together = connecting two objects), they can also be taken more metaphorically, like an out of control pandemic, or the joining together of marriage. Don’t always take the literal approach 😉
 wyrm_slayr#7477: Screw "rewind time", I would just do a game about slapping comedians
 Cameron#7818: But you play the tutorial in reverse so it's actually really hard.
 gamedevperson#8448: flip level then boom
 snuffysam#2767: instead of each level introducing more concepts, the game starts really complicated and ends with a tutorial level
 DrNukeLear#2414: We start with a finished game and delete the code.
 snuffysam#2767: since that could apply to anything from a detective rewinding a tape, to an FPS where you can only walk backwards, to some sort of evil farming sim where you play as an avatar of Famine trying to ungrow everyone's crops lol
 Cameron#7818: What if the theme is the clip of Will Smith saying "It's rewind time"?
 MrBen#0001: agreed
 snuffysam#2767: Perhaps something along those lines but more general like "Going Backwards"
 MrBen#0001: well I still think that the game's theme will be sth like 'that level again' or 'revind'
Mark really likes 'Braid' so I think the theme will be something like this
 Glardeen#4274: Hi everyone! Just posted on the teamfinder. I wish you all fun and a good time!
 Cameron#7818: The specific themes for 2017 & 2018 were "Dual Purpose Design" and "Genre without Mechanic"
 StuartXYZ#1675: Im on school, when I get back home I’m going to start looking for someone to do sound and music for the jam
 wyrm_slayr#7477: Lol
 Lukey#6052: i woke up to my reminder telling me about the gmtk game jam and i saw that this server was open and I literally thought I had missed the start of the jam
 Nobody6502#8971: One of my fave things about gmtk
 wyrm_slayr#7477: I'm doing fine, just pulling my hair out trying to add stuff to other people's code. How about you?
 Lukey#6052: im doing pretty ok
 StuartXYZ#1675: How is everyone doing?
 PepperBoi#4544: Yeah that’s kinda his thing
 snuffysam#2767: Pretty sure it's intentional, Mark wants games with unique mechanics
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: well yah it's gmtk. it's supposed to be a design-based jam
 gamedevperson#8448: yeah
 Nobody6502#8971: Always design based it’s funny
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: the first two were based on specific gmtk videos. all capitalisation and punctuation copied verbatim so you can see the inconsistent capitalisation
 calves#6026: joined together
 gamedevperson#8448: joints or something like that
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: ```2020; Out of Control
2019; only one
2018; GENRE but you can't MECHANIC
2017; Downwell's Dual Purpose Design```
 MrBen#0001: I think that this years theme will have sth with time revinding 👀
 Cass!#3031: ok, thanks a bunch!
 Ronoo#3699: ♥️
It was "Joined Together" last year!
 TheRealGodSpeedy#4238: hello ther
 Blackburn_PT#5557: any of you guys looking to take a padawan under your wing? I promise not to turn to the dark side
 Ronoo#3699: Hey guys, can I found somewhere what was the last theme?
 PepperBoi#4544: Oh yeah I remember that game
 snuffysam#2767: It was a really cute game 🥰  I remember u promoting it in the server a few times
And yup, that one was mine!
 Kira#7896: You made the black and white stealth game, right?
 Kira#7896: Yes. I'm honored you remember me 🙂
 snuffysam#2767: Oh hey, didn't you work on Bee-rista last November in Github Game-Off?
I think I recognize u from that server!
 MangoWorks#1202: i wish the jam could start right now
 BravoDS (Music/SFX)#0694: Hey everybody!
Is there power users of UE4 and who have worked on UE5. Can you tell the biggest difference for you and what about optimization? Is UE5 is more demanding for simple low-poly games?
 Blackburn_PT#5557: Thanks
 Kira#7896: Hi Shadow!
 Kira#7896: Hello everyone! Excited for the jam?
 Cass!#3031: hey all!  I'm trying to make a post in the team finder but it's asking me to allow messages from discord users even though I already have the setting turned on for this server. I have tried refreshing but the issue persists
 Ahat#0842: hello
 Ludows#5474: is there an artist that wants to join my team? we are already a programmer and a composer
 dardasaba#9759: Yup relatable, I recognize many people, like  here xD
 PepperBoi#4544: Sup
 Xypes#1040: Hi everyone
 Shimp#0064: ha, well thats actually vergil's line
 Teslobo#8274: I wanted his lines too
 Shimp#0064: not your line but alright
 Teslobo#8274: your portal opening days are over
 Shimp#0064: ay, fellow vergil
 Teslobo#8274: other mods strike me down if I'm wrong
 Teslobo#8274: in all seriousness if people want to make a discord server for jammers to vc and link it in said channel I believe it should be fine, we just reserve the right to remove the link if it gets out of hand.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: put it in 
 snuffysam#2767: I think if you and a friend were watching each others' streams on-stream, you'd get annoyed far faster than mods get annoyed
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: yeah we have had public voice chats in the past. it was a mistake
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: We don't care what you do with your own Twitch stream
 snuffysam#2767: hey, it says right there in the channel that they can't moderate what's happening off the server
and if you are actually working on the game, what's the problem if there's a horrifying echo filling the audio over and over
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: You're also welcome to start a discord channel and invite people to voice chat in there once the steams channel opens for posts. We're jot not about to moderate 5000 peole in a voice chat
 Teslobo#8274: 😠
 MolassesLover#4128: I don't think mods would be happy
 snuffysam#2767: you can do a bootleg VC once the streams channel is open
two people link their twitch streams, and then watch the other person's stream on-stream
 MolassesLover#4128: I mean I do, I just shouldn't
 Shimp#0064: good for you
 MolassesLover#4128: I'm a teenager without a job so I'd rather not toss my money at GMTK right now
 Dapheni#9999: Oh it's been a long time
 Shimp#0064: congrats on winning early!
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: Oooooor, ideal reason to become a patron? 👀
 MolassesLover#4128: No cat cam :c
 Cyan "CyF" Flower#8543: might have found a team
epic win
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: nope, sorry!
 PepperBoi#4544: Will there be a vc for the non patrons
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: cat cam is a camera the videos cats, its adorable
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: There's currently no way to directly link to a post, no - however, all the posts are loaded on the page at once, so to find a specific person's post, you can just Ctrl+F for their name (or DM them directly 😉)
 MrBen#0001: it would be nice to add vc channel tho
 MolassesLover#4128: Cat cam?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: yes it is, cat cam is with us every year
 Shimp#0064: i really wanted to make a joke there
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Oh, shit! Cat cam is back!!!
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Cat cam is live in the VC right now 🐱
 hello there#4536: 
 Blackburn_PT#5557: I meant a GMTK Team Finder post. i.e. I made one and I'd like to link to the people I'll be talking with, for example
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: i'm not sure what you mean
 hello there#4536: I think 
 Blackburn_PT#5557: Is there a way to share your GMTK post with other people? i.e. a link?
 hello there#4536: lol thanks
 davidnjihiahere#6326: wait, that went over my head. Good writing
 hello there#4536: all details on itch page
 Scolon#4218: When the jam starts
 Jonathor#1971: What time is the theme being released?
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: I have been working on an open source project (basically an emulator) for the past 6 years, so definitely have been on the long run for projects
 hello there#4536: no real need to finish them, they are meant to be tests to see what you can do under pressure, not full fledged games (few exception [am looking at you superhot] but usually not) as far as you enjoy yourself it is all okay
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Best you can do is make it easy to release, early on
 Despacito#8286: My motivation to finish/work on projects fluxuates a lot; I'll think I'm unable to work on something anymore, then all of the sudden, I blast out a whole zone in one night
 BadPiggy#5202: If people didn't show much interest in the jam or outside of it, there really isn't too much of a point working on it more
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Having released things, releasing is lots of work
 Blackburn_PT#5557: because hacking is fun. releasing a product is not
 snuffysam#2767: i always *say* that i'll expand my game jam games into a full release, and then i never do lol
idk if it's because the games are in too much of a "finished" state or because i just lose interest in the concept
 hello there#4536: hello there
 davidnjihiahere#6326: hi
 hello there#4536: yo, am back
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: if it happens then that's fine if you're just chatting to someone and decide you want to work together that's great but we just don't want lots of "looking for a team" posts in the general chat
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: I am basically just doing a demo, will polish it later for publishing
 Shimp#0064: well its not about the win, i just feel like game jam is fun when you can focus on creativity and not technical sides or minor problems
 linoooo21#3488: No worries, me neither lol, but i like making small demos, some simple pixel art, so maybe something nice will come out of it
 RoseLiberty#4192: I feel so self-conscious tho. Like, "is it cool to find a team in literally any channel that isn't the team finder and its tech channels?"
 SlamBamActionman#7160: We recommend the Team Finder as the primary way of looking for team mates 😉
 Cletus2000#0709: You should always join the jam and try doing something, its only 2 days, so no big waste of time if you dont succed
And you should still upload the project to get some feedback, even if you know youre not winning
 Shimp#0064: sure, im down, not sure if ill have enough time tho
 snuffysam#2767: i mean i found my team in this channel accidentally lol
 Blackburn_PT#5557: so is the best way to get a team to make a post on the team finder or are the real deals being made in this channel 😝 ?
 linoooo21#3488: Wanna work together? I’ve never done either but could be fun
 Shimp#0064: i wonder if i should participate if i barely made 1 meme game and 1 mobile game just for myself
 LEB#3729: I always think I'm some triple AAA company and I can make literally tomb raider graphics in a day
 davidnjihiahere#6326: I've been considering using the source engine for quite some time. How versatile is it?
 Tyrix#6647: yeah, keep the scope as low as possible! overscoping is one of the common mistakes
 snuffysam#2767: oh nice, that's really cool
 LEB#3729: I am developing a gmod-like game rn to practice but I think lowering the scope will be better
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: I would probably just put it on Android and iOS, then add some more levels accordingly
 LM#4371: same
 Octal#9139: I'm gonna continue development after the game jam if the idea is good enough
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Plus when the jam is over, I might just port to Android and just put it on the play store... and also maybe the Apple store as well
 Cletus2000#0709: Xd??
 LEB#3729: I mean I was game developing for 4 years so I guess it could work out for me
 RoseLiberty#4192: imposter imposter syndrome syndrome?
 DrNukeLear#2414: Sounds suspicious.
 snuffysam#2767: i'm just saying that i think you're selling yourself short
considering that your about me says "i am a game dev" and you clicked a link that was only available on the page for the game jam itself by scrolling down pretty far iirc?
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: That is imposter syndrome right there
 Octal#9139: I am trying so hard to not make an among us joke right now
 RedcoatsRevolt (Adam)#1185: This will be my first jam. I've been battling this whole hobby for a while and i'm taking the leap for the sake of learning and fun. I hope you will too 🙂
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Indeed, even after 20 years of doing the thing and having a bunch of stuff under your belt
 DrNukeLear#2414: Even if you fail, join for the community, for the networking and for the experience.
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: The thing I say about imposter syndrome is that everyone has it.
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: I do know that I will not be reviewing any games, since full-time job so there would be zero time to myself otherwise
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: One could still be a reviewer
 SlamBamActionman#7160: People are allowed to join in and look around, if they're interested in checking stuff out! 🙂
 LEB#3729: so now I'm not allowed to join servers I just want to communicate in
 RoseLiberty#4192: Jams are famous for hacky code and kind of up/down art. What's important is practicing and just trying to contribute to a project with a team!
 SlamBamActionman#7160: A jam is a perfect time to get some good practice in 😉
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Imposter syndrome can be a strong thing to fight
 MrBen#0001: hey sup
 Octal#9139: My first game is still in development, though it's really ambitious so I'm make a couple smaller games beforehand so I get the hang of it
 snuffysam#2767: i mean no offense but you're not a patron. why did you join the game jam server on the game jam participant link if you weren't interested
 RoseLiberty#4192: The main things to keep in mind for a game jam are communication and the rule of "good enough". it's kind of fine if you're not particularly impressed with everything you produce, it's more about making it quickly, communicating with the team's needs, and trying to put in just enough effort to make sure whatever you produce is contributing to the player's good time!
 SlamBamActionman#7160: You should be able to leave that section empty, I think! 🙂
 Cletus2000#0709: You should join a team and prepare to just learn new things and have fun while helping
 Tyrix#6647: probably leave it empty if that is possible
 dreamer_0D#0329: I am making a post in Teamfinder, but I don't work with any of the tools mentioned in the "what tools do you want to work with?" section. What should I do?
 polyrtm#0643: yeah i know but i guess that means when more start searching mine will be one of the few that shows up
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: My first game was in the early 2000s, which is a long time ago
 davidnjihiahere#6326: my first game was a gmtk gamejam game
 polyrtm#0643: there's a first time for everything :)
 LEB#3729: I am contemplating whether or not I should join the game jam, I'm terrible at making games so I don't think I'm good for this jam
 Squishy Turtle#3988: PSA: team != better game
 polyrtm#0643: only one of those does 2d art and their bio says they mainly want to code
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: You can hand hold a bit, but you do at times have to cut loose members if they are being a weighted slowdown or uncooperative
 RoseLiberty#4192: I can do almost everything except code but when I search I only get 14 options because I'm only matched with people who need almost everything except code
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Huh, could've sworn we implemented it the other way around! I'll look into that
 Cletus2000#0709: ºoº
 RoseLiberty#4192: rather than matching you with a bunch of people who need one or two of your skills, it seems to prefer giving youy 1:1 matches in the search
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Most important thing is having cohesion, making sure everyone's ego is in check, and putting a path forward... listening to your team and giving space but not too much space
 polyrtm#0643: well also filtering by looking for programmers
 RoseLiberty#4192: The teamfinder tool, I've noticed, uses increasingly specific searches if you mention you have multiple skills
 polyrtm#0643: also the search returns zero results so that's really not helping
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Where I work, the team I am on has 10 people... so 10 is not really out there for me
 RoseLiberty#4192: I've only started hearing about it in the last few years, anyhow
 davidnjihiahere#6326: godot is not really niche
 Triggered#6897: Yep new , niche maybe?
 RoseLiberty#4192: Godot's a relatively new and niche tool isn't it? At least compared to Unity and Unreal
 KrimsonAce#3457: Lemme DM you!
 adamhorner#4031: i think i'll do something related to wave function collapse for my game, the concept's p cool
 SlamBamActionman#7160: We're gonna try to get some better sorting options in though
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Ah, good luck to you!
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Order writer at a grocery store. Tho, I wanna transition into game dev soon.
 polyrtm#0643: this is true except nobody uses godot apparently
 Triggered#6897: Wanna team up
 Cletus2000#0709: God i want to see what your team comes up with. Good luck!
 polyrtm#0643: yeah team finder isnt super helpful if you dont get a message like immediately
 polyrtm#0643: see that's just too many for me to deal with
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: What do you do for your job if I can ask you in reverse?
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: 10? Daz crazy 🤯
 polyrtm#0643: highest math i know is like half understanding category theory
 addiment#3628: I want to be a "hardcore mathematician" but I'm fucking stupid lol
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I'll check it out when I get home! Thanks!
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: I'm 14 and I have a higher understanding of math (as it relates to coding) than most adults, yet until a few months ago I thought Russia was a continent 💀
 KrimsonAce#3457: Shadow, I'm incredibly jealous that you've managed to assemble a full team of 10. I'm also quite a fan of organizing/being team lead, but finding members purely through the team finder has been super tough
 davidnjihiahere#6326: I tried using trello and planning tools for gamedevs but they make me have creative blocks
 theChief#0001: Nah you don't NEED to know it xD it's pretty hardcore maths, not super useful for a lot of things but I love the way it looks
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: I use Trello for groceries, but I use GitHub projects for my code projects since it is linked to the repo and anything that happens in it... both Trello and GitHub projects are Kanban
 polyrtm#0643: oh i just clicked on this fellow t3ssel8r fan :)
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Trello board is a godsend
 addiment#3628: oh my god this FLIES above me. i feel so fucking stupid
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: It can work with issues, pull requests, etc. and can replace Trello
 polyrtm#0643: i typically just have everyone work on a different feature since there are normally only like 2 programmers on my team
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: You should checkout GitHub projects, it is essentially Trello but linked to a repo
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Vector math 🕶️
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Trello, github and a google doc for the design document.
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: I am a Senior Software Engineer for a large medical company, working on doctor facing systems
 Triggered#6897: Same except to doom
 theChief#0001: I should make a post tbh, I need someone who's really comfortable with audio tech - I want to do more audiosync stuff this time
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: What's your job, if you dont mind me asking?
 Nobody6502#8971: Welp, time for the tradition of watching every pixel prophecy ludum dare documentary leading up to a big jam
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Are there any strategies and such you plan on doing this time around with more people? i.e. stuff like kanban, agile, etc.
 NoFace#5304: ...you're have a good time then
 polyrtm#0643: same
 Triggered#6897: Thankyou
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: I have lead stuff at work, but I kinda just prefer doing. Although I do run my own open source project as well although it has just me
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I've led just about every jam team I worked on.
 adamhorner#4031: i can't even manage 3
 NoFace#5304: that and your management skills
 adamhorner#4031: holy god ten
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: How long have you been doing leadership and/or mentoring?
 NoFace#5304: IG, but it depends on your team synergy
 Octal#9139: I might do something with raycasting
 davidnjihiahere#6326: I was always terrible at math, that's why I'm making it. To help people not be as terrible as I was
 Scolon#4218: oh god 10 people
 addiment#3628: oh god
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I'm doing a stress test of my leadership abilities this time. So, I assembled a team of 10 people and it should hopefully reduce the workload of everyone else... in theory.
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: I actually failed math in school
 KingThrillgore#1400: Wordle but Triginomotry
 polyrtm#0643: didnt a math game win last year
 addiment#3628: the most useful "advanced" math IMO
 davidnjihiahere#6326: I'm planning to do a maths game. You guys are giving me ideas
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Yeah, but the end result of implementing that in 3D is more rewarding, imo.
 polyrtm#0643: trig is cool
 Triggered#6897: I have my math exam in 3 days and this exactly is my chapter are u for real use it?
 theChief#0001: Trig is INCREDIBLY useful
 addiment#3628: trig is based
 Octal#9139: Trig is pretty cool
 polyrtm#0643: "we are happy to announce our partnership with the Summer of Math Expedition 2"
 addiment#3628: god fucking damn it, I'm taking a summer college class on polynomials and it fucking sucks, polynomials are the worst type of math I've ever done
 KingThrillgore#1400: Wow. WOW. Did I just assume and clear my schedule for the game jam being this week and not next week?
 theChief#0001: I actually use second order derivatives for a bit of extra juice 😂
 Triggered#6897: Mutiplying both sides by null matrix we get...
 Cyan "CyF" Flower#8543: gameing
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Game Jam Theme: Polynomials and Matrices, also derivatives
 addiment#3628: i can already picture the soyjak
 polyrtm#0643: not how matrix multiplication works sadly
 theChief#0001: Mathematicians HATE this one hack
 Cletus2000#0709: GMTK themes are always so good
 Triggered#6897: Multiplying by zero both sides we get...
 theChief#0001: Will be announced when the jam starts!
 addiment#3628: wait until day-of
 polyrtm#0643: makes the math way easier
 KingThrillgore#1400: Has the theme been announced?
 addiment#3628: now this is gaming right here
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Too many zeroes! Needs to be wonkier
 polyrtm#0643: yeah i made my own 3d renderer once
 theChief#0001: Wrong, you need 4D matrices 😂
```
[4.0, 3.0, -2.1, 0.0]
[-9.2, 4.2, 1.3, 0.0]
[-1.7, 1.0, -17.2, 0.0]
[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]
```
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: I am going to take this jam easy and simple, I get paid to deal with difficulties
 addiment#3628: That's why I use SDL2 😩😩😩
 polyrtm#0643: 2d is also better for stylization imo
 NoFace#5304: Allo everyone!
 Shroudeye#2081: Seconded.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Which is why I only do 3D games in and out of Jams. I love the added difficulty.
 polyrtm#0643: that's why i use godot
 davidnjihiahere#6326: I do agree on this
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: ```
[4.0 3.0 -2.1]
[-9.2 4.2 1.3]
[-1.7 1.0 -17.2]
```
 addiment#3628: ngl I use Unreal and its 2D shit is AWFUL, 3D is way easier if you're using UE
 Shroudeye#2081: So, it is that time of the year again, huh - It is JAM TIME!
 davidnjihiahere#6326: depends with what you're going for
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Transformation matrices and vectors
 theChief#0001: Also shaders, I rely heavily on shader graph for visual style lol
 Cletus2000#0709: I think that in 3d is easier to get good graphics, but in 2D is easier to get the gameplay running
 theChief#0001: Not too much of an issue if you've got people to handle every part, or you have some prebuilt stuff, but generally it takes a lot longer to get the same amount done
 polyrtm#0643: yeah 3d is way harder especially for jams
 davidnjihiahere#6326: overwhelmingly negative on that
 theChief#0001: The pipeline for 3D is WAY bigger
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: 3D is okay, but then there are quad trees, BSPs, portals, meshes, etc.
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Y'all wack. Lmao.
 RBUKFAN#4802: Thanks 
 polyrtm#0643: imagine knowing how to do CI
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Only thing I am doing before the Jam starts is setting up CI/CD, a hello world, and a basic web publishing for the game itself
 RBUKFAN#4802: Ok I was just making sure
 theChief#0001: Yes!
 RBUKFAN#4802: Can I use construct 3 to make game jam games??
 polyrtm#0643: i'd sort by like least recent profile views or something
 polyrtm#0643: kind of but if you're like looking for 2d art and music like everyone else is then it's still sorted chronologically so you can still get buried
 davidnjihiahere#6326: is making a text based on pico 8 as tedious as it is on tic80?
 theChief#0001: It can look pretty good! I'm making an Xbox game with that style, and got top 10 for "graphics" in a 350 person jam with it 😁
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: Do the search features make up for it at all, do you think?
 polyrtm#0643: it's nice but posts get buried pretty quicky
 Triggered#6897: Thomas is still alone
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: thats exciting
 polyrtm#0643: i might do that if i dont get an artist
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Yeah, we can't give ruling on specifics but as long as its generic code then that's fine
 theChief#0001: I'm doing my usual "simple shapes + bloom" style 😂
 Cletus2000#0709: Yeah, in 48h seems hard to get good models done
 Dotwo (he/him)#5394: I'm trying text-based for this jam, see how we go
 MangoWorks#1202: ok so i have an idea a bullet hell + card game + tower defense + survival
 adamhorner#4031: yeah, i really underestimated the size, really soz
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: I am just going to go pixel art made by myself lol
 polyrtm#0643: 3d is too hard for me to get working in 2 days lmao
 Triggered#6897: I do but in 3d modeling.(not specifically for ps1/low poly)
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: Does anybody have experience with ps1 3D modelling? lmao I'd be interested in picking their brains a bit, or should I take this to 
 polyrtm#0643: it's days like these that i wish i could afford a modular synth
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: I just need to find the hard drive it is on
 polyrtm#0643: im just gonna use sfxr or something
 Octal#9139: I'm gonna use a Godot template lol
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: I need to like dig up the sound library I purchased like 12 years ago
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: Yes you can use pre-written generic code. Y ou can't write code specifically for the jam beforehand
 davidnjihiahere#6326: oh, that makes sense
 dardasaba#9759: Mint on my laptop, arch on my computer
 theChief#0001: It's essentially the opposite of an electromagnet - you move a magnet through a coil of wire and it produces current
 PepperBoi#4544: I’m sad about the timing this year cause a good friends birthday is on the 15th and they have work so I only have like 5 hours while they are there and they have a party on the 16th
 theChief#0001: But the word "magneto" wouldn't be protected, they are a real thing!
 theChief#0001: You generally have to licence them - the intellectual property is protected, so if you use it without permission in _any_ media you open yourself up to a bunch of legal issues!
 davidnjihiahere#6326: but yeah, that was something I was always thinking about, of course without being too on the nose about it
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: yeah most of the systems I need are all stuff I've coded before for previous projects, so I'd be skeletoning out some functions like spawning characters and assigning their stats, but in terms of in jam time dev, I'd still need to make the combat itself, movement, characters, animations, skills, room traversal, and random drops for items/powerups/units etc.
 theChief#0001: Ah got to it a second before I did 😂
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: very impressive! also pretty spammy, sorry
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Yeah can we not have stuff like this plz
 davidnjihiahere#6326: I was wondering, for example, whether Mark's game should be called magneto or something
 polyrtm#0643: oh thats why you were gone so long
 MrBen#0001: I mean you can only use engine templates and stuff from assetstore/marketplace
 davidnjihiahere#6326: I've seen movies with the same names as games and books
 Erick_Rdz#7107:  I just met a programmer   looking for artist, y'all should connect!
 OrangoMango#0973: I mean like already done player movement for example
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: could you be more specific?
 MrBen#0001: hey sup
 polyrtm#0643: Tuuuu
 PepperBoi#4544: Yoooo
 davidnjihiahere#6326: does copyright in movies translate to games?
 MrBen#0001: but not specifically for the jam
 OrangoMango#0973: it's allowed to use pre existing code that fits the theme?
 MangoWorks#1202: it was when i was like 8 so i was using scratch
 OrangoMango#0973: cool, in which language?
 Walrusware [they/them GMT]#3824: if it fits the theme go for it, as long as its designed within the jam time
 MrBen#0001: I boosted server nice 👀
 Lin#5169: a
 MangoWorks#1202: i tried making pacman on it and it worked it
 OrangoMango#0973: me too, and honestly to build a game it's not so bad
 polyrtm#0643: no media? [insert megamind]
 MrBen#0001: ok
 MangoWorks#1202: i have one
 RedTeapot#1960: NixOS is cool, thinking of installing it on my laptop when I have time to figure out the drivers (touchscreen, fingerprint sensor etc.; Arch wiki says this specific model has some issues with these)
 polyrtm#0643: probably not because it has to run on mark's computer
 OrangoMango#0973: Anyone is going to make the game jam game on a raspberry pi?
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: I think I'm gonna use a bunch of my old projects for this jam, I might make a roguelike rpg, with rng dungeons.
 RoseLiberty#4192: Unportalled Goose Title. Good title for a game about magnets and absolutely no gooses or magnets
 polyrtm#0643: what distro? i use nixos
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: I use Linux as well, but I also have CI/CD platforms that can target everything: Windows, Linux, Mac OS both x86_64 and ARM64
 MangoWorks#1202: WAIT there's an IOS One!?
 OrangoMango#0973: Try using wine. Linux is the best btw
 polyrtm#0643: linux gang!
 dardasaba#9759: Also talking about said magnet game, I would love to try it out but there's export for every platform except the one I use (Linux) :(
Sad
 MangoWorks#1202: there's a thousand game call minecraft on itch
 polyrtm#0643: yeah i assumed so i was being sarcastic
 DrNukeLear#2414: Genius!
 RedTeapot#1960: Doesn't calling it untitled make it titled?
 dardasaba#9759: Actually there are several games called "magnet game" on itch :P
 MangoWorks#1202: Wait theres nothing called a Magnet Game
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: The current name of my game is just called: XerTheSquirrel GMTK Jam 2022
 polyrtm#0643: now you're thinking with portals
 RoseLiberty#4192: Untitled Goose Magnet
 SlamBamActionman#7160: now that's a name you can run with
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Untitled Goose Game
 polyrtm#0643: just call it magnet game im sure that isnt taken
 Nobody6502#8971: heh
 JJfriends#3686: any teammates
 polyrtm#0643: my jam? gamed.
 DrNukeLear#2414: Nice
 SlamBamActionman#7160: You wouldnt be unknowing if I said anything
 adamhorner#4031: my toolkit? game maked.
 polyrtm#0643: hey are we unknowing participants in online communities
 RedTeapot#1960: Like this one?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: I often lean towards doing social experiments with unknowing participants in online communities
 polyrtm#0643: but the problem with that is i have to devote like half a day to level design normally
 Nobody6502#8971: Man the gmtk logos are more beautiful every year
 emaker#2708: what about a point and click RTS wait...
 polyrtm#0643: i tend toward puzzle games
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Strategy
 Octal#9139: I'm just gonna sit in the shadows until the jam starts
 DrNukeLear#2414: Not sure, it’s going to be interesting.
 RedTeapot#1960: That would be sick lol
 emaker#2708: I'm not surprised, i knew some people already know what their going to do.
 polyrtm#0643: how does that work
 DrNukeLear#2414: Which Genre? I’m hoping to be able to do ||multiplayer pvp point and click adventure||
 kloio#3544: Eyo
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: Already done!
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: I know, but I am going to make a specific genre of game
 polyrtm#0643: i have band camp until 5:30
 emaker#2708: A suggestion I'd like to mention/strategy I'd like to share. I'll do it now because when the Jam starts everyone will be freaking out trying to get an idea.
When trying to get an idea. open up a .txt file, and brainstorm. Begin thinking about anything and everything. No idea appears out of the void. Lets your thoughts simply wander around and write down everything that you think could be a useful idea. Let your train of thoughts take you anywhere. Once your happy with the idea you found. Take it out, and here's the part I like, dump all your other ideas into this channel. Leting the other grab ideas from yours, at worse someone makes a game with your idea and I think that would be cool.
 DrNukeLear#2414: The announcement said any team, any genre
 polyrtm#0643: yeah I know but I won't be able to see it when it releases
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: I believe it is being announced on YouTube
 polyrtm#0643: i hate that I'll miss the theme announcement
 polyrtm#0643: let's go team finder entry posted
 XerTheSquirrel#5366: I do have a genre I do want to do for the upcoming jam, regardless of the theme
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: o, I can't upload images, bodied
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: I only have the files from the early version before it was taken and used as a tool by some people studying the same thing as me, but here's an example of a small dungeon vs a 1000 room one
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: yeah I picked it to force myself to learn a skill I'd never learn otherwise, hated it, but it was for the better lmao
 Triggered#6897: Its funny how you learn not when things go as expected but when they don't
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: also to clarify i did this on dungeon room generation, enemy generation number/type/placement, object number/type/placement, powerup number/type/placement for every room, the biggest bug initially was that I had rooms placing ontop of one another, which was minorly a pain, but as a result I learned a lot about procedural generation, scriptable objects, and how roguelikes function lmao (and more about how rpgs handle rng which is SUPER weird that all your rng is controllable and dictated when you boot the game)
 Panda S#8673: cool
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: I did indeed, after I took the Kite moniker tho, I took Kite from an old series called .hack//
 addiment#3628: you're totally right, I was just sorta joking. Though it (maybe minute mouse inputs, though that can be easily controlled) could influence those numbers as well
 Triggered#6897: Now I know what chaos means!
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: the result was "untrackable" by a high end computer, meaning that there was no distinguishable pattern, which is better than chaotic systems which can be identified with a clear formulae
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: so the input and output of a function in unity like random.range(), is actually decided on startup of either your computer or the software, I'd need to check which to find out, but every number given in is pre-determined, so you can actually RNG track how things in a game are determined, this is how people speedrun final fantasy 10, they input kills, overkills deaths etc. and it determines their drops and lucks and encounter rates for ambushed and pre-emptives etc. so what I did was I ran the randomisation multiple times, stored different values of floats between them, and re randomised them to a ridiculous degree, making sure to re-roll the result if it appeared anytime in the last 3-5 answers also randomly determined if it would re roll
 DrNukeLear#2414: Nope. It can hold steady too easily.
 Triggered#6897: Or use the mics volume level?
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: did you knew everyone can steal anyone's emojis by right-clicking on them, save image, add them to a server they made and by nitro????
 addiment#3628: WAIT. RNG SEED BASED ON CPU TEMPERATURE.
 DrNukeLear#2414: Or that.
 MrBen#0001: hey
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: you mean the owl house
 addiment#3628: or use data from peripherals or something hardware-specific
 Panda S#8673: did you watch hunter x hunter
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: No gif 4 u. Lol. :p
 DrNukeLear#2414: Best way for true random is to use the current fraction of a second as the seed for your randomisation combined with the number of times you’ve run the randomiser.
 addiment#3628: chaos means unpredictability
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: honestly the hardest part of the whole thing was being able to check that it wasn't placing a room inside another room and blocking off the maze, at least in terms of code, the write up was hard for describing the chaotic systems used in RNG, and how my system was different
 Triggered#6897: By chaotic systems did you meant the output is very sensitive to the input? Also I appreciatw your expl. Thk 
 Panda S#8673: thank you
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: breaking my laptop?
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: it's not a game, just a tool .-. so kind of not, but I think I have screenshots for the proof of concept.
 Selviam#7268: Wow thats cool! sounds really difficult to code in though
 Panda S#8673: i cant invite my friend help
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: anyway guys I'm going to play some getting over it, I suppose I'll return from mobile and send in the chat that I broke my laptop
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: meaning every dungeon you get is theoretically different and it scales up with the more 3D square based tile rooms you add. it was basically proving a 2D concept in 3D with painstaking effort.
 Nobody6502#8971: I’d imagine a game with overly complicated meters for everything from stamina to thirst, and they get revealed as needed
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: most RNG systems work on what's called chaotic systems, this means there's a pattern to the numbers spat out that any computer designs, truly random meant that it goes through repetetive continous randomisation to the point no indistinguishable pattern can be found on any given computer, and the string doesn't loop for up to multiple thousandths of the numbers, and it also spits it out
 DrNukeLear#2414: Lol
 Scolon#4218: Bro there are reactions everywhere
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Ayy, that's a fun way to do it! lol.,
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: can we play it?
 Triggered#6897: So you found something better than "pseudo random"
or edit my previous messages, because that works as well
 addiment#3628: imagine going to college, this post was made by a fucking two-year-old
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: woa I am thinking of making a randomly generated 2d dungeon game
 Selviam#7268: what does it mean if its truly random?
 goSciu#6587: Next? Oh, phew
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: I made a "TRULY Random" procedurally generated 3D dungeon for my master's degree, it was hell.
 RedcoatsRevolt (Adam)#1185: Starts on the 15th
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: why this server only has link
 Selviam#7268: i love rougelikes but god loosing all your progress in an instant kills me
 Smol Gremlin#4962: Wait is it
Edit: nvr mind it is not
 addiment#3628: *next
 goSciu#6587: I completely forgot its this weekend 💀
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: yooo I have experience w this
 addiment#3628: I really wanna make a roguelike or something during the jam, it would be super hard but fun
 SamAlexandros (read bio)#5629: oh hey chat
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Has happened
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Oh, there def has to be a AAA team out there. I only have 2 pro devs on my team, out of 10 people. Only one works in AAA.
 RedTeapot#1960: That's cool, didn't know this existed
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: c'mon MMO's don't count nobody gets a fully functional mmo working in 48 hours and if they do they definitely sold their soul to some eldrich demon
 Selviam#7268: emoji reacts are so fun to click for some reason
 addiment#3628: now on to frame 52
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I shall emoji react so that all of you can emoji react!
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: it's bad that it was the first game that sprang to mind, how do you do so well with xeno 1, do p well w xeno x, then let it all go down hill in your more popularly advertised games??
 honiemun#0001: This sounds like Lose/Lose, that one game where shooting enemies deletes one random file in your computer
 davidnjihiahere#6326: there should be a AAA company in the gamejam, now that I think about it
 addiment#3628: 
 honiemun#0001: I was mostly thinking Xenoblade 3 lmao
 Triggered#6897: Limited no. Of ui buttons to start with?
You lose when you run out of files 
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: what jrpg has 30 UI elements that isn't xenoblade 3's atrocious UI showing?
 Selviam#7268: 30??
 honiemun#0001: jrpg where with each attack one of your 30 UI elements gets randomly removed
 lain#9757: oh! cool I'll go subscribe 🙂 thanks for letting me know
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Y'all seen the new emojis we got since last year?
 davidnjihiahere#6326: I might actually do the opposite, make ui a very important feature
 RedTeapot#1960: They are only for the ~~chosen ones~~ patrons
 addiment#3628: so you like my games because I literally just forget to add UI in time? 💀
 lain#9757: why are emoji reacts turned off here
 BadPiggy#5202: Games where you YEET stuff ( especially self YEET ) are always fun
 Roiboi#2055: i *do* like the idea of making a game where basic UI elements are removed, and seeing how the player reacts to that lack of information
 addiment#3628: it's been 12 hours, I've rendered 51 frames
 BadPiggy#5202: Or how about a papers please rip-off where you basically have to sign documents where the actual info is written in the fine print
 Selviam#7268: shoot to move is just too fun of a mechanic to not see during game jams
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: you just gave me a good idea for a game lmao
 lain#9757: dang now I really want the theme to be limited information
 Nobody6502#8971: Oh no even that theme allows shoot to move
 davidnjihiahere#6326: just plan for a shoot to move game, a puzzle platformer or a puzzle game with pushing blocks
 Roiboi#2055: and potentially many more...
 Roiboi#2055: i feel as if that could be interpreted in many ways, but off the top of my head
- A puzzle/platformer that has light mechanics and obstructed vision
- Mystery game where you have to piece together clues
- A game that lacks certain UI elements, or displays them in a different way 
- Shooter but you have to manually track bullets
- Of course, a shoot to move game where bullets shed light into the darkness, illuminating obstacles and such
 addiment#3628: 300 frames, 15 minutes / frame
 BadPiggy#5202: This is why I just stick to 2.5D lol
 addiment#3628: kinda off topic but I thought it would be fun to render something in blender, little did I realize that I would be burning up the rest of the night because my GPU is so fucking hot it needed my room's fan more than I did
 lain#9757: give pigs jetpacks
 BadPiggy#5202: They can self YEET though
 RedTeapot#1960: Pigs can't yeet
 Selviam#7268: maybe for this jam ill make a game with levels and more than 2 scenes for once
 BadPiggy#5202: Pigs can fly
 snuffysam#2767: penguins can fly and their most common predator is polar bears
 polyrtm#0643: no it's in a week also do you happen to have any lies
 BadPiggy#5202: So just make a game like fromsoftware
Okay
 Clive Dev#0446: why'd i read that with marks voice in my head xD
 Selviam#7268: so a really short tutorial?
 Scolon#4218: The theme will be a theme
 Locke Lamora#9214: ok thanks
 zazak#6674: It was amazing !
 snuffysam#2767: it's a vote of 1 person
 Roiboi#2055: i suspect the theme will be something like "Limited Information"
 Tapu#9161: It's in a week
 Selviam#7268: nope not yeet
 ToasterHead#2620: or -1/2
 Locke Lamora#9214: hello the game jam has already started ?
 Clive Dev#0446: mark is trustworthy enough to make a good theme
 BadPiggy#5202: Cool
So when we getting a shoot to move jam ?
 KokoBird#9800: I'm keen to see whats next! All of the previous ones have yielded great results.
 Tyrix#6647: then this years theme is "split" for 0.5? i could see that
 addiment#3628: he's like an evil genius or some shit, he has a british accent and everything /j
 KokoBird#9800: All from Mark's enormous, skull-expanding mind ❤️
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I like this form of theme choosing. Makes it a surprise for everyone.
 ToasterHead#2620: i knew the theme would be -2 and i wrote it ladt game jam in discord but no one paid any attention
 Clive Dev#0446: the excitement goes back up when the most voted theme is about to reveal
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: just to clarify there is not and will never be any theme voting - the themes are all straight from Mark's masterplan
 zazak#6674: Yeees
 addiment#3628: Ludum Dare does that though
 Roiboi#2055: we could just make predictions for fun now and see how close we got
 Clive Dev#0446: ah okay 👍
 ToasterHead#2620: Only one is 1, dual mechanic is 2, no control is 0, without mevhanic is -1 and joined together is -2
 SpellCast#5277: Hello
 Tapu#9161: The excitement dies down once you see the options
 RedTeapot#1960: And Superhot is move to get shot
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I'm honestly not a fan of voting for themes. Lol.
 Roiboi#2055: that's actually a good observation. themes like "dual purpose design" and "genre without mechanic" are highly design centric
 Clive Dev#0446: oh, you made it sound like there was one lol
 RedTeapot#1960: Nah, Mark decides it
 addiment#3628: I remember one year where my dumbass tried to get "gamer cred" by using a picture of Mark in my game
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Hell no. Lol.
 Tapu#9161: Nope
 ToasterHead#2620: They xan, in fact i was super close predictind the theme last time
 Clive Dev#0446: is there a theme voting form?
 snuffysam#2767: and downwell was mentioned in the first game jam description?
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: These themes are typically design focused.
 Roiboi#2055: i wonder if you could find a general pattern with the past few game jam themes. generally speaking, they can be interpreted in virtually any way and doesn't necessarily point towards any one genre or style...
 Triggered#6897: True, Like in the last one just join shooting and moving mechanics toghether
 RedcoatsRevolt (Adam)#1185: Awesome! Good luck
 addiment#3628: I think it was because so many jam entries during the "only one" jam, as in "only one bullet"
 snuffysam#2767: idk, because mark mentions superhot in the video explaining the game jams?
 Nobody6502#8971: There’s good ones though, one of my favorite puzzle games is shoot to move
 MrBen#0001: same here 🍩
 Tapu#9161: It fits any theme imaginable
 snuffysam#2767: i will say that game-jam-hype seems to be where they want these conversations
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: shoot to move is such a persistent meme for reasons I do not care to understand
 RedcoatsRevolt (Adam)#1185: I'm excited. First game, First jam here.
 Clive Dev#0446: haven't found anyone yet but its fine, i don't wanna team up with somebody awake at 1am my time xD
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Shoot to goo
 Tapu#9161: Make a shoot to move and say the floors have sticky goo
||for now, at least.||
 Selviam#7268: gooo theme that'd be cool
 snuffysam#2767: well, it *could* also be goo
 RedTeapot#1960: Oh gosh, I hope I won't get banned for starting that conversation
 DaGamerGuy#7832: explode to move
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: I like to Shmoove it Shmoove it
 Scolon#4218: The theme will be good
 Tapu#9161: Move to move
 Roiboi#2055: schmoove
 Selviam#7268: i was just thinking about shooting to move too lmao!
 ToasterHead#2620: Nah, its going to be all of the previous themes joined together
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: Shoot to Move >
 DaGamerGuy#7832: Move to shoot
 addiment#3628: nah it's gonna be "Joined Together" again
 KokoBird#9800: Oooh is your icon is cute! What's it's from?
 RedTeapot#1960: Shoot to move
~~Because you can't not mention it~~
 MangoWorks#1202: i found a teammate that uses construct 3
 DaGamerGuy#7832: dat is me
 addiment#3628: hey game(develop)rs
 ToasterHead#2620: Game Jam theme guess: Split Apart 😄
 KokoBird#9800: Here mine - ft some art that feels miles old even though it's only a month back. Been grinding hard at it.
 Dric#2439: i've been trying lots of different stuff
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: 
 Clive Dev#0446: woah, calm down there xD
 Roiboi#2055: speaking of which... hey  !
 SlamBamActionman#7160: 
 KokoBird#9800: Wow cute!!! I love the variety in your work woww
 Shadow DA B0SS#8637: ***LET'S FUCKING GOOOO!!!***
 Roiboi#2055: i'm glad to see some familiar faces though
 SAGIII#2881: Send me a itch link of your game on dm I'll try it.
 Techno#1832: hi
 KokoBird#9800: Oh cute! I'm also an artist looking for other stuff hahaaa. Do you have a link to your work? I'd love to see it
 Roiboi#2055: > Check the url of adam millard's youtube channel
> It may surprise you
'twas the day i realized adam millard was *not* in fact an adam millard fan account
 dardasaba#9759: I don't envy the moderators of this server during jam times... :P
 Jonathor#1971: Gl
 KokoBird#9800: Last year people had more time thanks to COVID, so I could see this year's numbers being a bit smaller maybe
 Dric#2439: i'm an artist so... everything else. coding and stuff
 dardasaba#9759: I'm sure they will xD
 Markositta#5352: Yes
 SAGIII#2881: Am I the only frenchie here? Need my daily dose of wine and cheese enjoyer x).
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Things will ramp up closer to the jam starting though
 SlamBamActionman#7160: You should've seen last year lol
 KokoBird#9800: You'll get through it ! Worst case they say something stupid back and you can report them to the mods so other members don't have to experience the same stuff. Good luck with the hunt- what were you looking for ?
 Selviam#7268: but its not *that* slow pretty fast
 SlamBamActionman#7160: You get faster chat the year only 20 people join the jam
 Roiboi#2055: i recognize more than i expected
 Markositta#5352: Slow chat is still a pain
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Ya'll great
 Roiboi#2055: oh wow
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Ngl today has been noticeably more chill than I expected. There was like only a minute of the chat scrolling by faster than I could read when the server opened, after that it has been pretty gentle.
 RedTeapot#1960: Nice to see some familiar usernames
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Eyyy! I remember you!
 Markositta#5352: It's back
 MrBen#0001: GG's!
 KokoBird#9800: True, whenever I've popped in it's been fairly chill!
I don't wanna think about jam day scolon LMAO. Didnt think about how crazy it'll become
 SAGIII#2881: Thanks, I'm on the club now hahaha.
 theChief#0001: So far 😂
 theChief#0001: Honestly could be worse
 Scolon#4218: Just wait until jam day lmao
 KokoBird#9800: Fr tho I can't imagine modding somewhere like here where the flood gates open to thousands of people for a few weeks hahaaa
Good work so far with it mods, and GL for the future
 Dric#2439: i found a team on team finder... now i hope that person responds to the discord dm... as an extremely introverted person this is kinda difficult...
 Roiboi#2055: 2021
i still have the screenshots
 Tapu#9161: Wait 2020?
 Roiboi#2055: throwback to the day i realized Thefearalcarrot was adam millard
 MrBen#0001: I am a kid
 KokoBird#9800: It's because they're the same age
I work with kids too
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: head over to the teamfinder!
 derberger94#8422: I’d like to collaborate with a game team. I’m a composer!
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: I worked as a school assistant for a bit and the similarities between modding and coralling hyperactive 14 year olds are shocking
 SlamBamActionman#7160: It's nicer for everyone if all is chill
 SlamBamActionman#7160: We try to keep things from reaching that level haha
 Selviam#7268: i'd imagine modding is a lot like the summer camp job i had lots of dumb arguments, angry chanting when something doesnt go right or just being defiant bc its funny (the non mods doing this i mean)
 happynessisgames#3531: I'm here too lol
 Kami lucky#3952: has the theme been announced
 SlamBamActionman#7160: I did disarm a nuclear bomb the other day. Nice holiday.
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Me and slam take breaks to do a bit of brain surgery every now and again, just to cool off
 MrBen#0001:
 RedTeapot#1960: Hey Techno
 SlamBamActionman#7160: the hardest job, clearly
 Techno#1832: Hey RedTeapot
 RedTeapot#1960: To be fair, getting 100 messages per second in a chat makes it impossible to keep track of conversations. So the cooldown might be a good thing actually
 SAGIII#2881: Is there a link to the patrons somewhere on the server?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: "Ah sweet, chat is calming down that means I can go make dinner- ah alright here we go"
 MrBen#0001: I try to make my sentences as long as I can ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 Scolon#4218: Just
dont
type
like
this
 MrBen#0001: nah ok
 Mrinin#2181: oof. oof.
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Can't fault that logic, but if people get annoying about it/persistent when we've made the stance clear, we'll just time you out and make your timer an hour
 SAGIII#2881: The people is never satisfied...
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Don't do this please, it's actually pretty annoying 😅 Trust me, we know how to keep the chat in a healthy flow
 Tapu#9161: Complaining is more fun /j
 wyrm_slayr#7477: I think the real question is: Why not?
I think the real question is: Why not?
 MrBen#0001: Im chaning my name to #makecooldown15
 Samurott#8879: I'm assuming it gets *much* worse as the start comes closer
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: yeah people complaining about the timer when the hype channel is eerily quiet aren't paying attention
I'm kidding I'm kidding. We're keeping 30 seconds until the chat dies down more though, we gotta be able to keep the chat flowing and readable.
 MrBen#0001: #Cooldown15secs
 snuffysam#2767: say something once? why say it again?
say something once? why say it again?
 RedTeapot#1960: And the 5-second cooldown hype channel is dead kek. Classic
 Tapu#9161: Possible, you could use something as the frontend to display the data and bf behind the hood to control all the logic. But bf sure will keep up to it's name
 Mrinin#2181: That's really smart. That's really smart.
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: bye!
 wyrm_slayr#7477: Or you could just write every message twice. Or you could just write every message twice
 harshith#7090: bye
 snuffysam#2767: people keep complaining about the cooldown but this is like, the most active channel i've been in, in any server
so i think it's justified
 Jonathor#1971: Finding a team that actually straighten with your goal is hard
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: also worth mentioning that it was a minute timer earlier, count yourselves lucky!
 SAGIII#2881: It's worse for mods man.
 RedTeapot#1960: The rules require the game to work without additional stuff though
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: if you people want to spam you can go in the hype channel!
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Warioware DIY gets you brownie points from Slam
 MrBen#0001: pls its really annoying to wait 30 secconds. Writing a message is 15 secs.
 harshith#7090: bye
 LM#4371: Pocket gamedev?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: I used to animate in Powerpoint as a child
 SlamBamActionman#7160: no
 Tapu#9161: Even if your tool is punch cards?
 Mrinin#2181: Proceeds to make game in brainf*ck
 SAGIII#2881: I agree 🤝 peace and code guys.
 wyrm_slayr#7477: What about Microsoft Powerpoint?
 MrBen#0001: Mods pls make cooldown 15 secs 😭
 harshith#7090: not popular engine
 unityAccount#7810: That would be Mg
 SlamBamActionman#7160: No hating on people for using certain development tools
👏 All 👏 engines 👏 are 👏 valid 👏
 MrBen#0001: wth?
 LM#4371: what even is this engine
never heard of it
 RedTeapot#1960: 420 megagrams?
 Tapu#9161: Thinnn
 harshith#7090: have any one tried ethanon engine
 SlamBamActionman#7160: 420 mg
 SAGIII#2881: I will go to hell for laughing at this
 1337_ub3#8083: how much do u weigh
 MrBen#0001: nah its all about the settings.
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: yep!
 SAGIII#2881: And apparently it's from my oui oui baguette country...
 Nobody6502#8971: This must be the busiest time of the year for you huh?
 harshith#7090: why
 Samurott#8879: Because UE5 attempts to use the most recent version of Cpp, but that is too recent for the engine's version checker, so it throws an error
 Selviam#7268: ohh lmao maybe one day
 MrBen#0001: thats where all fnaf games were mad bruh
 LM#4371: I did and I like this engine, its easy and has a lot of features
 JKAMAN280#9023: I'm gonna attempt to use ue5
 jack fractal#5340: The other half lights your graphics card on fire!
 Selviam#7268: maybe your best bet is to join a team with a coder?
 Samurott#8879: To even get cpp working in UE5 you need to mess with appdata config and turn off some features...not fun
 MrBen#0001: NOOOOOOOO dont say that word here
 SAGIII#2881: Never heard about that man T-T
 harshith#7090: have any one tried gdevolop
 LM#4371: Clickteam gang💀
 MrBen#0001: agreed 100%
 SAGIII#2881: Godot Engine gang is rising
 Samurott#8879: Unreal Engine 4, because Unreal Engine 5 is half broken (source-me attempting to use it)
 MrBen#0001: it mean to join unreal engine gang 😎
 Tapu#9161: Unreal Engine 4 team
 Selviam#7268: what does joinue4team mean?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Don't forget to rest and eat well! Very important!
 SAGIII#2881: He is both
 forresti#8460: thank you! I'm very new to coding and have been messing around with Unity for the last couple months, but I wanna give it a shot and just see how close I can get on my own in the small time frame 🙂
 Tapu#9161: Are you a man or a machine?
 MrBen#0001: #joinue4team #uninstallunity
 SlamBamActionman#7160: I got tabs for all necessary links open, and several Discord windows to keep track of all the chats
 Scolon#4218: The main reason for being in a team is splitting up the workload, bouncing ideas off each other, being able to make a slightly bigger game, etc.
It doesn't directly correlate with the game quality ye
 MrBen#0001: nope
 harshith#7090: it lags my pc
 Tapu#9161: Yeah exactly when I started coding running any code felt like launching missiles that could blow up in your own face
 SAGIII#2881: I was about to send it >:) you are not a mod for nothing haha.
 LEB#3729: hello
 RedTeapot#1960: I think it might help people get into programming because it might look less scary, but yeah, I don't find it easier
 snuffysam#2767: i will say, for folks that are worried about not having a team -
2021: top 4 games were made by a single person
2020: top 5 games were made by a single person
the only year where the top winner was a team was 2019. every other year, the top winner has been an individual
 harshith#7090: they made it in 3 months
 forresti#8460: I’m really new to all of this but am thinking about trying out the game jam. Do I have to sign up or anything for it?
 Nobody6502#8971: They do give a placebo of being simpler though. People who might be daunted by normal engines are able to put that aside to make stuff
 Tapu#9161: The other day I saw someone make a chat app using scratch
 harshith#7090: no just no
 JKAMAN280#9023: Ok, that's understandable
 SAGIII#2881: Scratch is pretty cool too ngl🤣
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Very difficult to moderate! There's a vc for Patrons, though you'd need to be a supporter for access
 Nobody6502#8971: clickteam fusion?
 Squishy Turtle#3988: yeah honestly I think they're kinda a scam. just as difficult or more difficult than text, but less useful to learn
 SAGIII#2881: Damn
 harshith#7090: but it lags my pc
 Selviam#7268: I think unreal has a system like that
 SAGIII#2881: There is visual scripting on Unity right?
 JKAMAN280#9023: So I'm curious, is there a reason there are no vc's?
 SlamBamActionman#7160: GMTK jam indeed!
 RedTeapot#1960: I like how the "no code" engines are in fact code (but it's in graphical form instead of text)
 harshith#7090: but its not free
 Tricky#1792: GMTK JAM???
 SAGIII#2881: Game Maker Studio 2
 Scolon#4218: oh ok, makes sense
 Tricky#1792: Wait
 Merus#7019: we've disabled embeds for non-patrons in these channels
 harshith#7090: i want no code game engine
 Clive Dev#0446: noice
 SAGIII#2881: Not really if you work efficiently. Godot Engine is really easy to understand. I use C# so idk with GDScript
 Scolon#4218: embed failure
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Stop trying to rickroll the chat, it's needless spam 😛
 harshith#7090: but is hard to learn in 5 days
 Squishy Turtle#3988: yeah what's your programming experience?
 StickyBeetle#4856: Depends which programming language you like / know and what you want to do
 Squishy Turtle#3988: I like the confidence
 SAGIII#2881: Godot Engine
 harshith#7090: what game engine do you recommed
 BBB#7952: Ive never made a game before in my life so im aiming for #1 spot
 hierr777#8659: btw
 hierr777#8659: its a rickroll
 Clive Dev#0446: the team finder is pretty cool
 Seinaru#6185: Hello everyone 🖤
 DaveB#7491: I’ve never done a Game Jam before so this’ll be my first if I can get what I need working to do it.
 Gallow#3741: ay everyone
 Mussar#2631: ahoy everyone 😄
 DrNukeLear#2414: That sounds awesome!
 hamster#8604: Last year, I helped my friend out because he wanted to do this jam. This year, I'm still gonna try to help a little bit, but the main thing I am going to be doing is filming my group of friends as they work on their project and putting it together in a short documentary for my college class. Hopefully it all works out well. I don't know why, just felt like sharing that.
 Powercore2000#0189: Howdy howdy all
 hierr777#8659: ok
 Clive Dev#0446: it's a rickroll link xD
 hierr777#8659: oh
 dardasaba#9759: Yup he's spamming it in every channel now, definitely a scam
 SlamBamActionman#7160:  Sorry, but please don't post random links like that! We have to be very careful of scam and virus links during jam times!
 Sherbert Lemon#8177: yh if someone says something like that with no context, I don't trust it
 Nobody6502#8971: It’s a rickroll
 hamster#8604: hey all
 dardasaba#9759: This looks like a possible scam ^ (not the gif, the link :P)
 Nobody6502#8971: I’ve been looking forward to gmtk ever since I discovered it hehe
 Tyrix#6647: that looks really cool. reminds me of puzzlescript.net but seems a little more versatile
 Nobody6502#8971: Maybe but I always thought discord removed the alpha layer on image upload
 Squishy Turtle#3988: probably just set alpha to 0
 Nobody6502#8971: I’m certainly curious how you got your pfp to show invis in both light and dark mode
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: My pfp used to be some scraped channel art. But I decided to join a invisible pfp cult. Become one of us. Join us.
 Squishy Turtle#3988: I bet it's a pretty recognizable pfp though
 Nobody6502#8971: I used to have the actual MOS chip as my pfp but that was a bit on the nose
 dardasaba#9759: Nice!
It’s a small little engine that’s just perfect for gamejams with built in tools like art and music editors
 RiverDog#8199: I can hardly wait, lets gooooooo
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: I'm assuming the other 4 are practice
 dardasaba#9759: What engine do you use?
 Nobody6502#8971: Honestly the only problem I have with looking for a team is my unconventional engine haha. But I’ve got ~3 days to decide anyway so
 Ibra#8468: not very user friendly or convenient though, although i guess something is better than nothing
 RedSeptim#2941: Noice
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Makes sense. I'm on vacation in the Netherlands
 RedSeptim#2941: Yes
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: R u in Europe?
 Sapient#3138: Yea that is general great advice , i mean u cant submit anything without a prototype
 Sherbert Lemon#8177: I like that they added Unix timestamp embeds
 Scolon#4218: Get a playable prototype asap and worry about the rest in your remaining time
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: 6pm 4 me
 RedSeptim#2941: Its 5pm for me
 Clive Dev#0446: eyy the channels are up, hello
 Sherbert Lemon#8177: this is my fifth jam and my first one was the only one I didn't overscope
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: I'm sad because my PC is broken and it won't be fixed until after the jam.
 Yuw#1591: for that i applied the 50% rule, getting out the game in half time, still had to do a lot after
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: if you are a beginner the big lesson to learn is that there is always more work to do than you think there is
 dardasaba#9759: Ayy same! We're in the same time zone!
 Yuw#1591:  solo is good in the beginning but then you have to carry all the work, last time i rushed a lot in the final day and was exhausting
 Melwing#3159: impossible
 NotExplosive#0002: Speaking of... I gotta go to work, 
 Nobody6502#8971: Trying to decide if I should make a team… I didn’t last year and ended up crunching way more than I should have to submit my game
 ember#1651: Haha
 Arfilish#8729: 7:08 PM
 Melwing#3159: 11am 😛
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: no, in fact you can't. one person submits and adds the other
 caibi#2508: 12:07 pm
 snuffysam#2767: it's noon here lol. i think most jammers don't live in HK
you should go to sleep though
 Alice Bottino#0001: 💃🎉🎉
 MolassesLover#4128: Sleep anyways
 NotExplosive#0002: 9:07AM here (pacific)
 ember#1651: If I'm applying with a teammate do we both have to apply?
 Ajidot#9212: ah okay, thank you for the clarification!
 LurkNautili#3246: nothing particular to UE that I can think of, it's all about pacing
 RedSeptim#2941: Cheers everyone
 RedSeptim#2941: Oh yeah of course I know, but Ue4 is my weapon of choice so far and I was just wondering if there’s any general advice for for trying to do a 2 day Jam in a very robust engine
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: after the game is submitted you add people as contributors on the project page. that part of the page isn't locked out after submitting like changing the build is
 SlamBamActionman#7160: You can join on itch after the jam starts though, but do it now to have it done 😄
 Scolon#4218: When you submit the game I'm pretty sure you specify it or something
Like 1 member submits the game and then you credit the team
 Floofinator#7144: the challenge is to make a game
 Lawn#1538: I've seen some great game jam games made in Unreal. If you know it well enough, I'm sure you'll breeze through it.
 Ajidot#9212: hello all, a question regarding teams (first timer here!)... is there somewhere I need to register the team prior to the jam, or is there one in the game submission form?
 Floofinator#7144: okay guys i have a challenge for this game jam
 NotExplosive#0002: You can jam in anything, your comfort level in the tool is way more important than the tool itself
 SlamBamActionman#7160: First, gaemdeaving
 Floofinator#7144: gaeming
 RedSeptim#2941: Awesome, Im pretty new to Game Dev and this would be my first Jam and I was just wondering how people find using Unreal Engine for this type of thing
 ImNotAsher#6733: did I as-     jk btw
 NotExplosive#0002: I don't know if there were any other MonoGame users last jam
 dardasaba#9759: Yeah, pretty much no matter what engine you use, there are gonna be many other users of it here in this server xD
That's how it's like with a 22k participants server :D
 ImNotAsher#6733: guys I make the music
 Kaideu#4302: Funny, I haven't left since the last jam lol
Didn't know a jam was starting
 Lawn#1538: There are dozens of UE users here.
 RedSeptim#2941: Any others here who use Unreal Engine?
 ImNotAsher#6733: any musicker
 Hobusu#5033: I remember back when Slam first changed to that pfp
 Nobody6502#8971: Oop we’re back 😄
 SlamBamActionman#7160: I am indeed a very unique pfp individual
 redve#6507: i enrolled a math course, because i think it will be useful in IT.
What do you think about a game:
-compute a riemann integral of sin) in range [5,15] to get to the next level?
 Sapient#3138: tbf ur pfp is more recognizable , i literally dunno anyone who uses that as pfp , specially of that char
 DaveB#7491: That’s my plan if I can get it building on Windows before the Jam starts. I’m using SDL and C++, but getting the project compiling in VS Code (on Windows) is driving me nuts.
 krepen#6466: ya sure
 batsiouny#2374: can i dm you
 redve#6507: don't you need rather a mathematician?
 NotExplosive#0002: 
 krepen#6466: i'm a 2d artist and would very much like to learn how to make an isometric game, how do I search for a programmer with those skills?
 Sapient#3138: Specially that profile pic
 Sapient#3138: Yoo i remember u , when last time i joined GMTK jam
 NotExplosive#0002: Hi Slam! You remembered me :>
 Lawn#1538: Function Conjunction was 🔥
 Sapient#3138: Why was i tagged here already
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Oh hey NotExplosive, welcome back
 redve#6507: i will probably create everything from scratch with SDL2
 MolassesLover#4128: No, I have sanity
 NotExplosive#0002: 🖐️
 KnowledgeCat247#7408: I thought the jam started next week
 Crostzard#7475: yea I remember in my last jam I only finished the sprites in one day
 waskerdu#5709: any other loons walking into this thing with their own engine?
 MolassesLover#4128: :C
 Hobusu#5033: ~~sorry, but being a gamer is a bannable offense on the Game Maker's Toolkit server, can't have people who like *games* here~~
 redve#6507: "tried" is a really good word here
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: yeah it's something i might consider for a 7 day game jam or the like, like my first game jam. but 48hr? it's hard enough to have anything working at the end without that
 JJfriends#3686: YEAHHH FINALLY
 KnowledgeCat247#7408: yeah
 MolassesLover#4128: That all sounds really low-level. Have you tried something like Unity or an FOSS engine like Godot?
 BladeTigron#6698: Oh I see- game jam is starting / soon
 redve#6507: 48 hours sounds deadly, ngl
 Scolon#4218: If you want to try a new engine for the jam I'd atleast mess around with it before the jam
Way too easy for it to lead to tons of stress later when you can't get simple core functions working
 redve#6507: the most advanced thing close to gamedev, was engine which could detect 2 rectangles collisions, and solve it a bit. Also some examples with textures, but i've never created entire game
 머댕이#7356: Where are you from?
 Kronos#2824: Ima put "Gamer since birth." in my description
 MolassesLover#4128: I am a game developer with 5 years of experience and that feels actually insane to say
 leo4gs#1470: same
 Teslobo#8274: I think you're more likely to do both if you use something familiar and just stretch yourself within the confines of that engine, but that's just my take
 Crostzard#7475: lol
 redve#6507: i entered the site to find team, and first description i've seen:
"i am developer with 10 years experience..."
and i was like: oh shit, too high league
 MolassesLover#4128: I want to do both
 Teslobo#8274: comes down to whether or not you're mainly in it for the learning opportunity or if you actually want to make a game
 머댕이#7356: Hi
 R2D2Vader#0693: ah yes, masochism
 Teslobo#8274: These 2 things are not mutually exclusive to be fair. A game jam isn't a bad opportunity to dive in the deep end of a lava pool
 snuffysam#2767: depends how you define "worth" and "new"
if you start practicing now, i think it could be good. my first finished unreal game was from a game jam, though i had used it for unfinished stuff a lot before then
 MolassesLover#4128: Yeah, I'll just practice this week
 Crostzard#7475: yea you will learn how to work as a team and if you will participate in more jams thats definitely going to speed up progress
 ArcadeEngineer#5120: you absolutely will not work out a new engine in 48hr. maybe if you start practicing now?
 batsiouny#2374: bro i just know basic stuff about code and that's it
 MolassesLover#4128: Is it worth trying a new engine for a game jam or will I just end up stressing out all weekend
 Léo#9895: I'm kinda excited for this jam but, apart from the fact i'm not sure i'll make it, I'm a bit afraid because I'm mostly a Source and Quake modder and I don't know how I could make something relevant for this jam (I can make levels in UE but never tried blueprints)
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: honestly my first gamejam I couldn't code, I just did bad pixel art, and most of it didn't end up getting used even though it was in the files for the final build because of time constraints, dw about it, do what you can and learn that's why I do the jams
 Merus#7019: definitely don't post it in his discord
 batsiouny#2374: same here
 SlamBamActionman#7160: He won't see it coming
 MolassesLover#4128: We should all collectively decide to ignore the theme and do the exact opposite to troll GMTK
 Scolon#4218: Check the jam page for a countdown timer
 dardasaba#9759: Ok
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: fair enough, I'm just a bit confused on the topic, and only thing I'm saying for clarification on it, is I don't agree w his political leanings at all lmao
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: ***E***
 ImNotAsher#6733: when does it start again
 Teslobo#8274: good
 MolassesLover#4128: People who write single word messages with slow mode enabled terrify me
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: LMAO fr??
 Its_Colden#2226: yes
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Considering you've only written two messages this year 30 minutes apart, I think the slowdown isn't much of an issue 😉
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: True
 Thefearalcarrot#5679: Once again, this probably isn't the place to be discussing Scott Cawthon and associated controversies
 unityAccount#7810: It's not waaay too hard, it's just not very efficient. You could try making a simple game like Flappy Bird if you'd like to give it a go
 Sherbert Lemon#8177: nah defo give it a go, my coding skills were a lot worse than even now when I started doing game jams
 Scolon#4218: There are a lot of inexperienced people participating in game jams, don't worry about it. You can find teams just looking to have fun/learn
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: I uh, don't see what he did wrong, all the information I see just says he donated to candidates for his political beliefs, and something about his political donations being harmful to the LGBTQ community, which fair enough ig? but that shouldn't cost a guy his job or safety from doxxing and death threats, even if I disagree w right wing politics? is there more to this than I see?
 MolassesLover#4128: My skills and experience are too good for a team 😎😎😎
 dardasaba#9759: It's necessary, this place is quite hectic as it is, without slowmode... *Shudders*
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Same. But your not going to hear this for another 15 seconds...
 redve#6507: i'd look for team too, but my skills and experience, are "a bit" below average
 batsiouny#2374: ok noted
 Its_Colden#2226: I hate slowmode
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Not in general pretty plz
 batsiouny#2374: i'm looking for a team does anyone have any open spots ?
 dardasaba#9759: I use an engine, making my own engine/making a game without one is way too much for my skill level right now :D I wouldn't even know where to start
 MolassesLover#4128: I'd rather use a tool like Unity. If I want to do low-level rendering programming, I'll always do it to make an engine with an editor rather than a game
 BadPiggy#5202: Unity.
I'd rather break my head with game design
Rather than break it with game engine dev
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Scott Cawthon not something I feel is necessary to discuss at this place and time 😛
 MolassesLover#4128: Scott is basically identical to Notch, all to say on the matter
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Google will fill you in
 LurkNautili#3246: yes
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: I'm concerned to ask, but why would you get banned? has he done stuff I don't know about?
 redve#6507: Do you prefer making games with tools like unity, or you rather create everything from scratch with pyengine / opengl / something_else ?
 MolassesLover#4128: Don't be like Scott Cawthon, you'd get banned from this server
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: helps he became the biggest gaming yt trend among kids
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: LMAO
 BadPiggy#5202: Or just be like Scott Cawthorn.
He tried making wholesome games at first and everyone said his art looked more creepy than wholesome
What happened after that was fate lol
 redve#6507: -you do A, or B?
-yes
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: he's a bit of a unique case tho his games are weird af
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Definitely me
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: I don't endorse this btw, this is just the clear example of what most startup game companies actually do, which makes sense, it's just not smart if you aren't like 10,000% sure you're gonna succeed and you'll likely not get re-hired by the company you steal staff from lmao
 BadPiggy#5202: Or just be like Lucas pope
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: unironically better to join a company, and try to company hop higher up the ladder as fast as possible in any company until your name is recognised then dip with a bunch of associates to found your own studio, then it's all down to if you have the ability or not to produce a good game and deliver the public promises, you either end up like no man's sky at launch or you end up like team cherry / the devs of darkest dungeon
 BadPiggy#5202: Honestly, even this doesn't work too well lol
Best example is a Dev called stuffed wombat
 Fupi#4400: it wasnt even supposed to be a joke i thought that was something people said? 😭
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: itch.io lets you sell them without trying, tho tbh most of getting discovered comes down to PR and a game idea that can absolutely hop onto a trend online, otherwise you gotta go the slow route and make games consistently and slowly build up a fanbase and hope it all spreads from there
 BadPiggy#5202: I can't think of a joke in the last 10 years or so which was actually funny
Apart from my own games .....
 Fupi#4400: exactly i just make quick games for fun rn 🤷
 SlamBamActionman#7160: Let's calm down now, it's not even a funny joke 😛
 Merus#7019: you're not a lawyer?
 Fupi#4400: ANAL
 Ibra#8468: super *what*?
 BadPiggy#5202: I'd never expand a game I made lol
Too many games out there to try and sell one
 redve#6507: ```
im super anal about writing good code
```
i like this description
 Fupi#4400: if its a game i actually want to expand im super anal about writing good code
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: honestly, if it works it works, I'll clean it up in the final sprint or as I need to for new functions, AGILE exists because every programmer is lazy when it comes to this lmao
 Ibra#8468: *lmao* amazing
 BadPiggy#5202: I cook only spaghetti with very spicy meatballs during jams
 Fupi#4400: im the second option in jams cuz i usually dont work on them ever again lol
 MolassesLover#4128: I actually confused Enigma and Imitation Game too so it worked out in the end
 Ibra#8468: for jams, spaghetti mostly, but you need to find that right balance between spaghetti and well balanced where its not so good that you spend all your time focused on code quality but its not so bad you dont know what the fuck you were writing the next day
 redve#6507: afaik in competetive programming, the second option is pretty common
 redve#6507: When you write code to your games, you try to make high quality, well descripted code, or create a messy spaghetti, as you won't touch it in 2 days?
 Ibra#8468: *wait thats the movie im talking about lmao*
i accidentally misnamed it and it turned out to be another movie with the same plot
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: I genuinely liked imitation game a bit more, but it's been years since i've seen either
 MolassesLover#4128: Yeah, I have. I don't like it too much, though
 Ibra#8468: lol i assume you've seen Enigma?
 emaker#2708: Could've all worked if the game allowed integer logic the way Homebrew Vehicle sandbox does it
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: or the fact he was gay and castrated for it, which is messed tf up
 MolassesLover#4128: Turing comes up almost every day in my life for some reason
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: yeah okay it was similar to what I was thinking, I've never heard anyone actually bring up anything to do with turing in day to day life that wasn't just "does it pass the turing test"
 MolassesLover#4128: It basically means it can simulate a Turing machine, so it can do universal computation
 Snakes#8442: Turing complete means it a computer can solve any problem, no matter the time frame
 emaker#2708: Buffering the damage would've been pretty hard too. needing a new ssytem for every damage value I want
 MolassesLover#4128: Oh! That sucks, didn't know about this
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: I've never heard this term in my life what is turing completeness? I assume it's related to turings work on the universal computer?

 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: ahhh you had problems w the collision detection, that makes more sense lmao, my b
 DrNukeLear#2414: I started by modding Quake.
 snuffysam#2767: never had a DS unfortunately,
my introduction was game maker, before there was a studio version, 14-ish years ago
 emaker#2708: only way around would be buffer the second damage but now you would still need something to deal that damage on the next frame and hope that another turret didn't damage it on the next frame
 BadPiggy#5202: Ah lol
Never owned a Nintendo console
 Dric#2439: i remember making a simple game is flash AS2, it was easy and it teached the basics of game creation, those were good times
 MolassesLover#4128: Omg WarioWare D.I.Y is so good but 7yo me never touched it because I was so stupid
 emaker#2708: Um, no. The game runs at a frame rate and uses that to detect collisions, meaning if you had 2 turrets in sync shooting at an enemy at the same time, only 1 turret would actually do damage. At the same time, it was nearly impossible to deal 2 damage as you couldn't reduce the value in a counter by more then 1 at once.
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Ow
 Crostzard#7475: amateurs(microsoft exel)
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: pretty sure you could actually bypass most of these limitations w clever use of emitters, and state changes on the emitters to spawn a different prefab of enemy that has different speed etc. depending on the wave count, cause I remember doing something similar myself
 BadPiggy#5202: Unfortunately I have no idea what that even is lol
 MolassesLover#4128: Pretty much, yeah. Aside from that the game's tools had 'Turing completeness' and you could make pretty much any game
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: E
 SlamBamActionman#7160: *Several people are typing...*
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: wasn't the only limitation the amount of stuff you could place in a level?
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: ....sure
 MolassesLover#4128: RPG Maker is a godsend
 emaker#2708: I made a tower defense game in little big planet 2, stopped working on it when I couldn't get passed the limitations of the game itself
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: RPG-mid
 MolassesLover#4128: It's better than Game Maker if I'm honest
 lemongreen#7383: jo
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: I totally forgot about that I'm literally in tears
 BurnV06#5857: Same but for Gameboy
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: now little big planet I agree with, I remember working for AGES on that making different state controllers on the second game, unironically a better game dev building system than, RPG-maker lmao.
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: I like retro stuff and wanted to make a game for the Atari, then I made some progress and was like, n o .
 Fruit-Punch#0147:   experiences
 MolassesLover#4128: This and LittleBigPlanet
 [CalGon]{kite}#6435: are we allowed to talk about that here? the kids doing amazing dev work in roblox are unironically being stiffed by roblox, they should be earning so much more but they tax the income and outcome of converted robux
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: LMAO is it not true
 Tapu#9161: I remember last time people liked my in game comments more than the actual game and the comments took me only 15 mins whereas the game took 13 hours 💀
 dardasaba#9759: I used scratch when I was like 6 xD
I was kinda addicted to it, a couple of months ago I found my old scratch account and it's full of weird "*games*" 
 Fruit-Punch#0147: That's why I know Java and JavaScript.
 MolassesLover#4128: The jump from Python to Assembly and then to Java had me rolling
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: I still can't mod Minecraft lol
 Crostzard#7475: game devs start in roblox studio
 BadPiggy#5202: ASM > everything
 Fruit-Punch#0147: I started with modding Minecraft
 𝙆𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙚𝙙#6926: Scratch>Python>Assembly>Java & C#
