 ron0studios#4591: !scrape 10000
 Taz#9211: clearly
 JamiesonH#0334: They clearly needed it
 JamiesonH#0334: They just needed one person to give them computing training which was gonna be me lol
 JamiesonH#0334: It was barely a tech company lol
 Taz#9211: that is shambolic
 Taz#9211: 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀
 Taz#9211: how u gonna be an interviewer for a tech company and not know how to use zoom
 Taz#9211: omdd
 JamiesonH#0334: So I just withdrew my application
 JamiesonH#0334: The interviewer was really dumb and didn't know how to set up a zoom meeting and kept on trying to schedule zooms for times in the past
 Taz#9211: what happened 💀
 JamiesonH#0334: I just got completely screwed over on my first computing application lol
 Taz#9211: Good luck with the application 👍
 Taz#9211: yeah good plan
 Taz#9211: ohh I see
 JamiesonH#0334: It's not needed for the job but it'd probably help my application, even if I'm just familiar with it
 JamiesonH#0334: I applied for a job at a company that uses ruby on rails
 Taz#9211: out of curiosity what are u building 
 Taz#9211: while in Rails it's pretty clear
 Taz#9211: thing
 Taz#9211: like if u used nodejs as ur server then ig there's a lot more ways to do thr same ring
 Taz#9211: no clue lmao I just remember hearing that somewhere
 JamiesonH#0334: Confuzzled
 JamiesonH#0334: How's it opinionated lol
 Taz#9211: or smth like that
 Taz#9211: so it's hard to do it wrong
 Taz#9211: yeah I've heard it's good cause it's opinionated
 ByName#9795: Yes
 JamiesonH#0334: is ruby the language and rails the server-side framework then?
 ByName#9795: Not sure about the rails bit but it's just a framework so shouldn't be too bad
 ByName#9795: Ruby isn't - it's very similar to python
 JamiesonH#0334: is it hard
 ByName#9795: Vaguely played around with it ages ago
 JamiesonH#0334: does anyone here know anything about ruby on rails
 ByName#9795: Physics past papers are very humbling indeed
 ByName#9795: How many other public comments?
 JamiesonH#0334: Johnson goated
 JamiesonH#0334: Lolllll
 ron0studios#4591: wiping clickbait clean off the planet
 ron0studios#4591: absolute madlad
 ron0studios#4591: mr johnson destroying the entire MIT faculty
 ron0studios#4591: johnson 👑
 JamiesonH#0334: physics a level ocr b 2022 paper 1 🥰 😍
 JamiesonH#0334: valid
 Streak#8889: then I did a physics one and got WAY more humbled so back to neglecting compsci 😁😁
 JamiesonH#0334: me the day before paper 1
 Streak#8889: got humbled
 Streak#8889: then I tried a past paper and er
 Streak#8889: me a week ago
 JamiesonH#0334: finished subject
 JamiesonH#0334: i am yet to do any computer science revision
 JamiesonH#0334: 😠
 Streak#8889: security remove this man from cr4 pls
 JamiesonH#0334: am gatecrashing xoxoxox
 Streak#8889: when we get back on the 22nd it's round 2 of functional programming feat. big J
 ron0studios#4591: lol
 ByName#9795: Most likely
 ByName#9795: Exams
 ron0studios#4591: what's happening in computing society atm?
 Taz#9211: yeah true, especially since u wanna do quantum stuff in the future
 Streak#8889: and it's a sick opportunity
 Streak#8889: people taking part in it get reserved use on quantum computers for the Challenge
 Streak#8889: imma probably still give it a go anyways
 Taz#9211: if only we didn't have exams
 Taz#9211: oh sick
 Streak#8889: plus it's just so cool to be able to put quantum computing into actual use
 Streak#8889: will almost definitely end up getting really hard but it's super fun and you can learn unbelievably fast
 Streak#8889: if anyone's curious, IBM's Quantum Spring Challenge starts in a few days
 JamiesonH#0334: But it's specific to the 2022 exam advanced information so doesn't have everything
 Streak#8889: pin moment
 Streak#8889:
 JamiesonH#0334: Idk if this at all useful but here's my flashcards for the a level spec
 Taz#9211: Good job nvidia
 Stef#4362: I can give u it
 Stef#4362: Idk
 Stef#4362: He's using my alt account because he doesn't want to spend too much time on discord cuz of gcses or something
 ron0studios#4591: what about sarath?
 Streak#8889: 😭😭
 Stef#4362: I'm here, just not very active on discord
 ron0studios#4591: probably more often than I do lol
 ron0studios#4591: the other 2 yr 11s who come every week
 JamiesonH#0334: Who??
 ron0studios#4591: ill try and invite them if they have discord accounts
 ron0studios#4591: i should probably get sarath and stefan on here
 Taz#9211: yeah it is pretty fun
 JamiesonH#0334: So is heroin
 ron0studios#4591: coding is fun
 JamiesonH#0334: It's a curse
 JamiesonH#0334: You lot need to stop coding before it's too late I'm serious
 Taz#9211: so not even type casting literally just reading the same bits differently
 Taz#9211: I think the casting line was just like, go to this place in memory and read the bits as if it were a float
 ron0studios#4591: elon musk bought twitter
 ron0studios#4591: actually maybe not, I have no idea what's going on with that casting line
 ron0studios#4591: will shed some light on mr johnson's inverse square root algorithm code as well i think
 ron0studios#4591: its cool stuff
 ron0studios#4591: may or may not consider doing a presentation on it in the future
 ron0studios#4591: low level programming and pointer arithmetic makes so much sense now
 ron0studios#4591: I got enlightened abt memory and pointers last month, and its really awesome
 ByName#9795: 3 weeks left
 Taz#9211: so idk how much he'll be able to go through
 Taz#9211: yeah we're going on study leave in a couple weeks as well
 ron0studios#4591: gcse's and all
 ron0studios#4591: idk if I'll be able to stick around for all of it though
 ron0studios#4591: ayy f#
 Taz#9211: Mr johnsons doing functional programming
 ron0studios#4591: whats on next week wednesday?
 ron0studios#4591: r/iam14andthisisdeep
 JamiesonH#0334: So deep
 Streak#8889: > Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.
 JamiesonH#0334: Something like "only when all is removed that can be ,is perfection acheived "
 JamiesonH#0334: Does anyone remember the quote Johnson gave
 JamiesonH#0334: Bussy discussion
 ByName#9795: I remember vaguely something like that
 JamiesonH#0334: I can't remember probs doubly
 ByName#9795: Oh yes
 ron0studios#4591: doubly linked or single-linked?
 ron0studios#4591: id assume it would be a linked list
 ron0studios#4591: yh
 JamiesonH#0334: Didn't they teach us stacking but with a linked list
 ByName#9795: I only remember shifting
 ByName#9795: Do they?
 JamiesonH#0334: Don't they teach us both
 ByName#9795: OCR like shifting
 ron0studios#4591: stacking seems to be an easier method imo
 ron0studios#4591: stacks or shifting everything to the next available slot?
 ron0studios#4591: what collision resolving do you guys use?
 JamiesonH#0334: It's more about the uses of hashing than how they work tbh
 JamiesonH#0334: They wanted to give a simple example of a hashing algorithm
 ByName#9795: Very
 ron0studios#4591: jesus a level hashing is **intense**
 ByName#9795: Many collisions!
 ByName#9795: Exactly
 ron0studios#4591: what
 ron0studios#4591: lol
 JamiesonH#0334: Isn't the ocr hashing just doing modulus 5
 ron0studios#4591: md5 i think was recently cracked
 ron0studios#4591: there are a few breakable hashes out there
 ron0studios#4591: yh
 ByName#9795: SQL is dangerous
 ByName#9795: Best way of storing passwords imo
 Taz#9211: lmaooo
 Taz#9211: yeah use a table element
 ByName#9795: Manually add it to a table html page
 ByName#9795: Just store it in the html
 JamiesonH#0334: We couldnt even get it to use JSON iirc
 JamiesonH#0334: I don't think our hosting let's us use databases
 JamiesonH#0334: Lmao
 ByName#9795: Add a cncm account system that uses the OCR modulus hashing algorithm so we can see it happen
 Taz#9211: there's definitely been a hash collision between two passwords before but not on the same account
 ByName#9795: If a website uses really bad hashing it would work
 ron0studios#4591: elon musk buying twitter
 Taz#9211: lmao yeah
 JamiesonH#0334: Surely the odds would be too low
 JamiesonH#0334: Lol do u think that's ever happened by accident entering a random password
 Taz#9211: im not sure how other uses of hashes use the original though
 JamiesonH#0334: Oh yeah of course
 Taz#9211: if two passwords have the same hash then you can use either one to login to someone's account
 Taz#9211: actually it usually won't even matter whether you find the original or not
 JamiesonH#0334: Nws!
 Streak#8889: thanksssss man
 JamiesonH#0334: I'll bring it to conpsoc on wed
 Streak#8889: every break and lunch in the library
 Streak#8889: i'll go back to my year 9 nerd life
 JamiesonH#0334: It took me two weeks to read
 Streak#8889: light work
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah If you can read it before may 16th
 Streak#8889: when do you guys go on study leave?
 Streak#8889: we should have compsoc first week back
 Streak#8889: ~~tysm~~
 Streak#8889: ✋ can i
 JamiesonH#0334: I can lend it to someone until I have to go on study leave if anyone wants it
 JamiesonH#0334: Automata , formal languages and Turing machines by Dr emre sermutlu
 ron0studios#4591: lol
 ron0studios#4591: P = L coming up soon? 🤔
 Streak#8889: ooh which book
 Streak#8889: still quantum computers doing mad stuff
 Streak#8889: still hype
 Streak#8889: for practical purposes
 Streak#8889: Still
 Streak#8889: Quantum might have the power to do NP in P time but it's a different problem
 Streak#8889: Yeah i shorthand-ed it a bit there, NP = P afaik is just to do with classical stuff
 JamiesonH#0334: Fr
 Streak#8889: 200 qubits
 Streak#8889: just make 2 quantum computers
 Streak#8889: ez
 Streak#8889: bit bad
 Streak#8889: obv it's way better than classical, but literally imagine trying to do anything with just 100 bits
 JamiesonH#0334: They should just make more qubits
 Streak#8889: Like, one of the best QCs rn is about 100 qubits
 Streak#8889: even if they have, quantum computing hardware is nowhere near good enough
 JamiesonH#0334: Plus it looks good on personal statement
 JamiesonH#0334: The book Mr Johnson recommended us is good at it explaining all that stuff I'd reccomend it to everyone
 JamiesonH#0334: Solving p = np would have to be a mathematical proof I think
 ron0studios#4591: or is that a workaround to it idk
 ron0studios#4591: a qc might make every np problem solvable in p time, but is that really solving the p = np problem?
 ByName#9795: What are the odds the NSA already have it?
 JamiesonH#0334: Like if you are reversing a hashed password , you might know it's in a defined range of lengths so there'd only be a finite number of reverse hashes within that
 JamiesonH#0334: Even if there's infinite reverse hashes there's a finite number within certain parameters
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah that'd be fucked if someone had already figured it out lol
 Streak#8889: ~~and nobody would say if they've done it or not~~
 Streak#8889: ~~plus you already know all the governments of the world would put BANK into coming up with something as powerful as hash reversal~~
 Streak#8889: crazy
 Streak#8889: yeah but even just the fact that it'd be *possible*
 JamiesonH#0334: Like if we prove p = np then we still won't know how to implement these polynomial time algorithms , even if they've been proven to be theoretically possible
 JamiesonH#0334: Isn't np = p more of a theoretical thing tho
 Streak#8889: but ofc QC might just bang out NP = P or something and then who knows what's gonna happen
 JamiesonH#0334: Oh yeah I suppose how could you reverse a hash if there's infinite possible reverses
 Streak#8889: there's a few other algorithms like Simon's and Shor's which might be able to break specific hash functions but nothing general yet
 Streak#8889: if you want to keep running Grover's until you get the original, it'd be a very long time
 Streak#8889: so
 Streak#8889: Any of those infinite reverses could be the 'original' one
 Streak#8889: And Grover's Algorithm only ever gives you one answer when you measure it
 Streak#8889: just because infinite input -> finite range does stuff like that
 Streak#8889: but each possible hash has infinite reverse hashes
 Streak#8889: Grover's *could* offer an exponential speed-up at finding a reverse hash, maybe, if I understand it correctly
 Streak#8889: And that's also a bit of a problem which stop you using Grover's Algorithm
 Streak#8889: bit of an issue
 Streak#8889: so
 Streak#8889: since an infinite input domain goes to finite output range
 Streak#8889: but hashing is nonlinear
 Streak#8889: y'know how QC is all vectors and matrices? It's all based on Linear Algebra, so naturally it'll be really good at linear problems
 Streak#8889: There's a couple problems with it as far as I can tell
 Streak#8889: Quantum Computing to break hashes is still being researched afaik
 Streak#8889: To be honest, idt anyone knows yet
 Taz#9211:  might know
 JamiesonH#0334: This may be a stupid question but is there any chance quantum computers could be used to reverse hashes
 Taz#9211: ~~including my future terrorist cell~~
 Taz#9211: privacy for all
 Taz#9211: very hype
 JamiesonH#0334: My game of life thing is on cncm.co.uk but it's very unfinished
 JamiesonH#0334: The optimisations are cool too
 JamiesonH#0334: Game of life is pretty easy to implement
 ron0studios#4591: never done one but would like to 👍
 ron0studios#4591: automatons are fun
 ron0studios#4591: woah thats cool
 JamiesonH#0334: I tried to do it when I was making a game of life simulator and I think I found that it wasn't possible
 ron0studios#4591: you can do it in c++, which probably means you can do it in java as well (but idk). You can do a bit in python as well
 ron0studios#4591: i don use js much lol
 ron0studios#4591: idk
 JamiesonH#0334: Can u even do much bit manipulation In JavaScript
 ron0studios#4591: Shrey, btw, which question was it that you had to use dynamic programming in to solve?
 ron0studios#4591: I saw some guy use bit manipulation to condense it a ton
 ron0studios#4591: go for it
 Streak#8889: so you can't capture now and attack later
 Streak#8889: good for it to be done early, well before anything quantum starts
 Streak#8889: either way, cool to see recognition of quantum starting to come about
 Streak#8889: depending on your moral standpoint 👀
 Streak#8889: or not hype
 Streak#8889: Lattice-based cryptography should be one of the best quantum-safe techniques so that's hype
 Streak#8889: ig that's why it's getting popular now
 Streak#8889: OpenSSH 9 is coming out rn and is starting to implement it
 Streak#8889: Yeah I heard about that
 Taz#9211: I don't really understand it but u might find it interesting
 Taz#9211: btw  idk you might find this interesting but it's an encryption algorithm run on classical computers that aren't easily cracked by quantum computers
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah u were both right lol
 Taz#9211: oh mb didn't see rudrrayans suggestion lol
 JamiesonH#0334: This isn't really code for anything I just wanted to see how little lines I could implement rudrrayans memo Fibonacci in
 JamiesonH#0334: I'll use that when I get home
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah thanks rudrrayan and taran
 Taz#9211:  surely javascript has a data type for big numbers
 ron0studios#4591: idk how though i dont use javascript
 ron0studios#4591: so you can probably keep stacking up fib if you use that
 ron0studios#4591: doesnt js have bigint?
 JamiesonH#0334: The problem isn't the Fibonacci code it's JavaScripts addition doesn't work for large integers
 ron0studios#4591: srry I was off for a few days, couldnt reply earlier
 ron0studios#4591: you could try filling it up from the bottom to top I think
 JamiesonH#0334: PHP no
 ByName#9795: Or use PHP but rewrite it so function definitions are consistent
 ByName#9795: Use that
 ByName#9795: Yes
 JamiesonH#0334: Intercal?
 JamiesonH#0334: What's the one where u have to say please
 Streak#8889: Or one or mr Johnsons new favourite languages
 JamiesonH#0334: I spent so much time on cncm that it became the goto
 Streak#8889: go make it in java innit
 Streak#8889: Lmao
 JamiesonH#0334: I cba to do it tho I'd rather just complain about JavaScript even tho it's my go to language
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah perhaps
 Streak#8889: and there's less converting junk going on
 Streak#8889: So like column addition but you can add 10 digit numbers at a time instead of single digit
 Streak#8889: Then join them all up at the end
 Streak#8889: If it adds to an 11 digit number then take the extra 1 as a carry for the next one
 Streak#8889: Then add each 10 digit from left to right
 Streak#8889: Like so if you're trying to add a 20 digit number to another 20 digit, you now have two 10 digits in place of each one
 Streak#8889: Split the number every 10 digits
 Streak#8889: Say js works up to like 10 digits
 Streak#8889: I did have an idea for long addition
 JamiesonH#0334: probably bcos javascript just cant handle this stuff
 JamiesonH#0334: bruhhhhhhhh i hate this
 JamiesonH#0334: it doesnt work
 JamiesonH#0334: it probably sucks but it only ever deals with single digit addition so it adds large integers correctly now
 Streak#8889: when js is so bad you have to rewrite it yourself
 Streak#8889: 💀 💀
 JamiesonH#0334: doing my own long addition function now oof
 JamiesonH#0334: ezzzzz
 Streak#8889: write your own addition function ez
 Streak#8889: just keep everything in the larger data type from the start
 Streak#8889: Maybe something type casting-y?
 Streak#8889: awkward
 JamiesonH#0334: I'll try this in a sec
 Streak#8889: 🤷‍♂️
 Taz#9211: I think shrey is right i doubt it breaks specifically at 79
 Taz#9211: I can't see why it would suddenly stop working at 79
 Taz#9211: yeah that's so weird
 Streak#8889: If you get your code to manually print the sum of fib(77) and fib(78) what does it
 Streak#8889: so 77 and 78 are correct?
 JamiesonH#0334: No clue why
 JamiesonH#0334: And everything after that is wrong too
 JamiesonH#0334: No at n=79 the value it returns is one too low
 Taz#9211: is there an error?
 Taz#9211:  wdym by randomly stops working
 JamiesonH#0334: acc its better to store memo as an array
 JamiesonH#0334: rudrrayan did a presentation on it help
 JamiesonH#0334: doing  's fibonacci memoization thing and my code randomly stops working at n = 79
 ByName#9795: Yeah, they've said that 'no preparation is needed' so it can't be overly specialist
 Streak#8889: from 11+ days
 Streak#8889: non verbal reasoning
 Streak#8889: but then on the other end of the spectrum i've seen like
 Streak#8889: where they give you a bunch of graphs, text, tables and stuff and ask you questions about it
 Streak#8889: ik my sister's econ stuff sometimes has like dataset questions
 Streak#8889: yeah i feel like it depends on what you're applying for
 ByName#9795: That's what I was thinking, I presume a lot of them if it's a half hour thing. I've seen some say it's that then others look more scenario based
 Lgenommen#9795: Im assuming like logic puzzles
 ByName#9795: Does anyone know what 'analytical thinking' exercises are?
 ByName#9795: Use the ai to write the ai
 Taz#9211: works surprisingly well
 ByName#9795: Just use copilot to write all your code
 JamiesonH#0334: cncm.co.uk btw
 Streak#8889: workplace exploitation
 Streak#8889: and like
 Streak#8889: I wouldn't have a clue but sounds fun
 Streak#8889: Write it down ig and if you have any inkling of how to do it write that down too
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah I could've made the cncm website my nea tbf
 JamiesonH#0334: Video game Dev is kinda cool but I cba to do it permanently
 Streak#8889: I mean you've done a lot of cryptography work tbf
 Lgenommen#9795: an idea ive always thought abt is chess which gets better or worse depending on their oponent
 Streak#8889: unique approach
 JamiesonH#0334: Cba to do something on cryptography or ai
 Streak#8889: much easier
 JamiesonH#0334: I did not do that lol
 Lgenommen#9795: id like to try figure smthn out involving it but it sounds like it would be hard
 Streak#8889: Just write down any idea that pops into your head and take a look next year
 Streak#8889: Funnn
 Streak#8889: 🏃🏃
 Streak#8889: doing my nea for me is back on the table
 Lgenommen#9795: ive been looking at AI alot recently icl
 Streak#8889: Well then
 Streak#8889: 👀👀
 Lgenommen#9795: i had that typed in when u sent it wtf
 Lgenommen#9795: bro
 Streak#8889: Idk yet
 Streak#8889: ..somehow
 Streak#8889: I wanna do AI so my NEA's gonna be focused on that
 Lgenommen#9795: das a shout
 Streak#8889: idk dyk what kind of computer science you wanna do later on
 Streak#8889: Ez
 Streak#8889: just do my nea for me
 Lgenommen#9795: be
 Lgenommen#9795: how it should bne
 Lgenommen#9795: haha
 JamiesonH#0334: You're the only one in the school
 Lgenommen#9795: How many caydens are there
 Lgenommen#9795: Yeah
 JamiesonH#0334: Oh ur cayden who went to moulsham right
 Lgenommen#9795: 12 lol
 JamiesonH#0334: what yr are u in
 Lgenommen#9795: fair enough
 JamiesonH#0334: yeah its baby language tbh
 JamiesonH#0334: also you get like 7 months so its fine
 Lgenommen#9795: isnt that roblox language
 JamiesonH#0334: i used lua
 Lgenommen#9795: yh but i cba to use unity or anything
 JamiesonH#0334: fair enough
 JamiesonH#0334: it takes like, 5 minutes for me to decide i would do a platforming game
 Lgenommen#9795: ik but i will change it abt 7 times before actually doing anything lol
 JamiesonH#0334: half the problem isnt making the problem lol
 Lgenommen#9795: half the problem shouldn't be making a problem yk
 JamiesonH#0334: you can ask for ideas of what to make , or just do a video game like half the year does
 Lgenommen#9795: like give me a complicated task to tackle
 Lgenommen#9795: like pls
 Lgenommen#9795: i wanna be pointed in some direction
 JamiesonH#0334: how come
 JamiesonH#0334: as long as its complicated enough
 Lgenommen#9795: id hate that
 JamiesonH#0334: pretty much
 Lgenommen#9795: is the nea just make what u want?
 JamiesonH#0334: and then coding probs 50
 JamiesonH#0334: i have 80 hours minimum on the written , probably more like 100
 JamiesonH#0334: thats the scariest part , that it could just all be crap and itd be like 50 hours wasted
 JamiesonH#0334: i have no idea if its good or shitn
 JamiesonH#0334: 37k words of pain
 JamiesonH#0334: cringe
 Streak#8889: how's the nea?
 Streak#8889: gaming moment
 Streak#8889: Ohh
 JamiesonH#0334: its for my nea
 JamiesonH#0334: it took ages lol
 Streak#8889: Damn that was a quick flowchart how'd you make it
 Lgenommen#9795: oi that bangs
 JamiesonH#0334: so sexc ooooooooo
 JamiesonH#0334: yeah files in java are a piece of shit
 JamiesonH#0334: more descriptive
 Lgenommen#9795: oh but it works now so tyty
 JamiesonH#0334: u should probs name the lines variable lineCount or smth
 Lgenommen#9795: idk ive never done files in java and i swr the internet is useless
 JamiesonH#0334: it was awful pseudocode, it was basically just java except super lazy
 JamiesonH#0334: was about to send
 Streak#8889: ocr pseudocode revision
 JamiesonH#0334: lol i just wrote that exact code in pseudo code
 Streak#8889: Instead of while and ++
 Streak#8889: Can't you just for loop
 Streak#8889: Yeah ig
 Streak#8889:  what were you gonna say before?
 Lgenommen#9795: more like this?
 Lgenommen#9795: ig that all readLine does tho anyway
 Streak#8889: Like idk count the number of \n occurences
 Streak#8889: does BufferedReader not have a quick way to access the number of lines
 Streak#8889: what'd it be if you needed to find it out there
 Streak#8889: Out of curiosity
 Streak#8889: Yeah lol
 Lgenommen#9795: oh as in manually write it
 Lgenommen#9795: yh but how would i figure it out without reading the whole file at least once
 Streak#8889: if you want the program to be mildly more adaptable
 Streak#8889: you could also figure out the length of the wordle words and just store it as the first line of the file or something
 Lgenommen#9795: true
 JamiesonH#0334: why don't you just hard code it
 Lgenommen#9795: that does actually make it easier lol
 Lgenommen#9795: yh ig
 JamiesonH#0334: wait a sec, is the number of words in the wordle words file going to stay the same permanently?
 JamiesonH#0334: starting on line 24:
 Lgenommen#9795: just like make an array and use a for loop to add them all?
 JamiesonH#0334: acc i'll show you how to adapt your method to make it correct
 JamiesonH#0334: this is how i'd do it
 JamiesonH#0334: you're opening and closing the file twice tho which is unneccesary
 Lgenommen#9795: then when i get a word the file is basically redundant
 Lgenommen#9795: i just thought cos i only needed to access them all once i wouldnt bother saving them all as an array
 JamiesonH#0334: and then randomly index that
 JamiesonH#0334: don't you want to turn the file of all wordle words into an array of all the words
 Lgenommen#9795: its basically supposed to choose a random word from the file and save it to answer
 ByName#9795: When are we making NFTs with Piet?
 Streak#8889: and there's no way mr johnson'll miss the chance for f#
 Streak#8889: Presumably, it's Functional Programming
 ron0studios#4591: are we doing f# after easter?
 Lgenommen#9795: like friday 00;00
 Streak#8889: Does the challenge drop beginning of Friday?
 Streak#8889: Bit of creative thinking innit
 Streak#8889: I mean they don't look undoable though
 Lgenommen#9795: yh they look hard innt
 Taz#9211: i looked at the previous puzzles and couldnt be asked
 Lgenommen#9795: recommends groups
 Lgenommen#9795: 1-4
 Streak#8889: What are the team sizes?
 Streak#8889: Might do it
 Streak#8889: This Friday? Damn that's fast
 Lgenommen#9795: its like logic puzzles i think
 Lgenommen#9795: 1-4 april
 JamiesonH#0334: This is the first I'm hearing of it
 JamiesonH#0334: I might do it when is it
 Lgenommen#9795: i wanna do it but also want ppl to do it with yk
 Lgenommen#9795: is anyone gonna do the CS50x thing
 JamiesonH#0334: Quantum>>>>>>
 Lgenommen#9795:
 Lgenommen#9795:
 JamiesonH#0334: I forgot bout that
 JamiesonH#0334: Oh yeah
 Streak#8889: notch is never valid
 JamiesonH#0334: Is notch valid?
 JamiesonH#0334: mine is 2500 with no blanks
 ByName#9795: So about 3k lines in total
 ByName#9795: The server is another 600 or so
 JamiesonH#0334: noice
 ByName#9795: That's the client program
 JamiesonH#0334: extension
 JamiesonH#0334: i use vs code counter
 JamiesonH#0334: ahh
 ByName#9795: It's a few folders
 JamiesonH#0334: one folder *
 ByName#9795: My http client interface is 400 lines
 JamiesonH#0334: if its all in one file and u use vs code u can check
 ByName#9795: Lots, I haven't bother counting as it's all over the place
 JamiesonH#0334: how many lines do u have ben
 JamiesonH#0334: nvm still processing give it a min
 JamiesonH#0334: like subsribe comment notifs on now
 JamiesonH#0334: everyone spends coursework lesson pissing about , me fen and log spent them all working on cipher challenge / our website
 JamiesonH#0334: no
 JamiesonH#0334: lol
 ron0studios#4591: I thought the cs a level cohort was good
 JamiesonH#0334: they are silly
 ron0studios#4591: how
 ron0studios#4591: what
 ron0studios#4591: **people have barely started**
 JamiesonH#0334: yes
 JamiesonH#0334: plus graphics sounds and libraries
 ron0studios#4591: by coursework, are you talking about those massive booklets the 6th formers have to write that mr sims shows the year 11s?
 JamiesonH#0334: lines of code varies a lot , mine is gonna be about 3k when its done
 JamiesonH#0334: its like 10-20k words
 ron0studios#4591: ah i see
 JamiesonH#0334: yeah both
 ron0studios#4591: or do you have to write a lot as well
 ron0studios#4591: is it just coding?
 ron0studios#4591: dang
 JamiesonH#0334: our coursework is due in a week and some people have barely started
 JamiesonH#0334: new coursework upload tonight #whoshyped
 Streak#8889: Stressful hour
 Streak#8889: was kinda tiring icl
 Streak#8889: Lmao
 JamiesonH#0334: We all forgot about it and didn't do it lol
 Streak#8889: So how was OUCC yall
 Streak#8889: Shocking
 Streak#8889: Gasp a whole getText
 ByName#9795: If you include getText then that question had more
 ByName#9795: Oh, no
 JamiesonH#0334: Even with the two parts of the file one combined ?
 JamiesonH#0334: Ahhhh
 ByName#9795: Bubble sort pseudocode was worth 1 more mark
 JamiesonH#0334: The main pseudocode question was read from a file , save it to a string and then replace every first letter after a full stop with a capital letter instead of lower case and save it back to the file
 ByName#9795: A level programming paper is basically just writing y10 extension programs without an IDE or testing
 JamiesonH#0334: The scope of my game isn't that ambitious lol
 JamiesonH#0334: I suppose but that's not for a year and a half until u start that
 ron0studios#4591: I've been wanting to make a game for a while, but keep putting it off for other things. Maybe if I make it my coursework, I'll actually finish it 🤔
 ron0studios#4591: fair enough
 JamiesonH#0334: Wanted to keep it simple and do something easy
 JamiesonH#0334: Of it
 JamiesonH#0334: I've sent YouTube vids before
 JamiesonH#0334: It's pretty boring , just a video game
 ron0studios#4591: whats your project?
 ron0studios#4591: gl
 ron0studios#4591: ite
 JamiesonH#0334: I have a date with doing my coursework but gf takes priority
 JamiesonH#0334: Respect !
 ron0studios#4591: I have a date with *Thomas' calculus : Early transcendental by George B. Thomas* during half term. Will probably get through the first few chapters
 JamiesonH#0334: cncm.co.uk now please
 JamiesonH#0334: Cncm stay winning only non single comsci students
 JamiesonH#0334: I have a date
 JamiesonH#0334: Bitch
 Streak#8889: can spend valentine's Day learning cause I know y'all mfs single
 Streak#8889: Ik a couple good places, hopefully by Monday I can get them up?
 Streak#8889: Yeah I was planning on making that
 ron0studios#4591: forgor to ping
 ron0studios#4591: 
 ron0studios#4591: heya shrey so is there anyway someone who hasn't been following along with the quantum stuff to catch up over half term? Maybe a video course (udemy 🏴‍☠️ ) or youtube series/video or set of articles to just read through to get everything? Asking for both myself and some people who came in half way into the series or didnt get it. thanks1
 JamiesonH#0334: The whole test was that and then like very basic questions about queues and then a couple questions writing pseudocode
 JamiesonH#0334: No Dijkstra's or A* or harder sort algorithms
 Streak#8889: Linear search
 Streak#8889: Homies taking gcse fr
 ron0studios#4591: lol thats true
 JamiesonH#0334: Like we had our algorithm test and they only asked about binary sort , insertion sort and linear search
 Streak#8889: And the GCSE was wild like one and a half hours or something and most of us finished in 15 minutes
 ron0studios#4591: java = cringe
 Streak#8889: I swear it is actually bare easy though like so far the hardest thing has been java and that's cause I've put in negative effort
 JamiesonH#0334: Nah they just made the test super easy
 Streak#8889: flex
 Streak#8889: Now we actually get to beat supercomputers
 Streak#8889: way more interesting than whatever we've done so far
 Streak#8889: quantum algorithms - the real reason QC's so powerful
 JamiesonH#0334: We had two mocks and they took 20 minutes to complete a 60 minute exam
 JamiesonH#0334: Computer science a level is so easy
 JamiesonH#0334: Dating simulators
 ron0studios#4591: whats the theme going to be for next half term?
 Taz#9211: 🤓
 ron0studios#4591: is it a poem or not?
it seems like a haiku somewhat,
yet the rhyme and the flow,
dont have time to write so...
please finish the poem instead
 ByName#9795: It is a poem
 Professor Chaos#9143: Sounds like a poem.
 JamiesonH#0334: But like a phoenix rising from the ash, cncm.co.uk is reaching international glory and acclaim
 JamiesonH#0334: I poured my heart 💖 out to it and it slapped me round the face
 JamiesonH#0334: Cipher challenge is FACIST and lame
 Streak#8889: Johnson's 2nd and we're 4th
 Streak#8889: But who's the other?
 Streak#8889: Ones obv the cheaters in Y8
 Streak#8889: Apparently there's two Kegs teams in honourable mentions
 Streak#8889: #deep
 JamiesonH#0334: In better news, has anyone ever wondered , "what will wordle be on my birthday or other significant date🤔🤔" well thanks to cncm.co.uk/wordle-solver/ I know that when I turn 21 it will be "learn" , that's crazy
 JamiesonH#0334: Cipher challenge results released spoiler alert it's making me Kms
 JamiesonH#0334: Too
 JamiesonH#0334: Lex fridman is cool oto
 JamiesonH#0334: Oh yeah I saw that project it's insane lol
 ron0studios#4591: For anyone who likes weird code, like the inverse square root algorithm. Check out the **international obfuscated c code contest**, which is just that, weird code. There was a program that made a spinning ascii donut, where the code itself was in the shape of a donut its crazy.
 Choopies#5687: wait rick and morty from the hit gane fotnit????!!
 ron0studios#4591: in the wrong context
 ron0studios#4591: which is probably worse
 ron0studios#4591: I mean my last bio was "its about time I CP you"
 JamiesonH#0334: It means dual penetration
 ron0studios#4591: its a CP term
 ron0studios#4591: dynamic programming
 JamiesonH#0334: What do you think DP means
 JamiesonH#0334: That
 JamiesonH#0334: Why is your bio tahy
 ron0studios#4591: *(these are copypastas btw, I haven't actually read them yet)*
 ron0studios#4591: Cringe??!! Is that all you shitposting fucks cay say?! Durr based based based cringe cringe  Based Based Cringe Cringe Based Cringe I Feel Like I’m In a Fucking asylum  Full of dementia Ridden old people That can do nothing  but repeat the same fucking words on loop Like a fucking broken record  Cringe Cringe Cringe Cringe  Cringe based based  Onions Onions Snoyy  Onions Lol Onions Cringe  Boomer  Le zoomer  I am Boomer  Go Zoom Zoom Zoomies  Zoomer Going Zoomies  NNGAAAHHH I Fucking Hate The Internet so God Damn Much Fuck Shitposting Honest To God Fucking Hope your mother chokes on her own feces In hell You Cocksucker But OHHHHHHHHHH I know my post is cringe isn’t it Cringe Cringe Cringy cringe  Based Cringe  Based Reddit Cringe  Based Cringe Zoom Cringe  Onions Cringe Based  REDDIT BASED AHHHHHHHHHHH
 JamiesonH#0334: Cringeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
 JamiesonH#0334: Rudrrayan what the hell
 ron0studios#4591: To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.
 Coloursplash#9680: he doesn't understand Rick and Morty so of course he couldn't get the joke smh
 Choopies#5687: I'm not even gonna bother trying to understand that
 ron0studios#4591: ah, a common misconception. I am not surprised that your neanderthal underdeveloped cortex could not comprehend the extremities of this statement. I, at even my most semiliterate form was able to decipher the nuance and depth of this statement. Your kind truly are inherently cretinous.
 Choopies#5687: I mean I didn't understand because I'm the most modest person
 Choopies#5687: ohhhh
 JamiesonH#0334: The joke is I'm actually a show-off
 Choopies#5687: deep
 JamiesonH#0334: I would never self compliment
 Choopies#5687: yeah lmao when jamie said "thanks james" i thought he was self-complementing
 JamiesonH#0334: I don't think so lol
 ron0studios#4591: So is Ben going to present soon then?
 ron0studios#4591: Yh I see
 ron0studios#4591: Lol
 JamiesonH#0334: At least I think lol
 JamiesonH#0334: It just mutates the gene
 JamiesonH#0334: Like ur hackathon project was genetic , that doesn't use backpropogation does it?
 ron0studios#4591: Yh
 JamiesonH#0334: You can do AI without back propagation anyway
 ron0studios#4591: Oh ok
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah I just meant if you were gonna briefly explain how it works to a friend
 ron0studios#4591: Ite but we've already done ai in the first term though
 JamiesonH#0334: Because of the beefy integration
 JamiesonH#0334: Going into the maths of it is quite hard
 JamiesonH#0334: Tbf if ur teaching ai to a beginner back propogation probs isn't best place to start
 ron0studios#4591: as in backpropagation?
 JamiesonH#0334: Integration with respect to the neural networks weights and biases or smth
 JamiesonH#0334: Just tell them it's magic
 JamiesonH#0334: Who's confused;
 ByName#9795: Going to have to do an in depth session on how AI actually works now to explain it to a some confused yr13s
 JamiesonH#0334: wait no , F#
 JamiesonH#0334: but it only lasted like 2 months
 JamiesonH#0334: he used to teach us haskell at lunch optionally
 Taz#9211: i think he used them to teach some y13s functional programming?
 JamiesonH#0334: Nah bro
 ron0studios#4591: rudrrayan is the pinnacle of all names clearly
 JamiesonH#0334: Jamie is better name
 Streak#8889: rename yourself to james
 ByName#9795: Should I rename the coding club team to be the cult of James?
 Streak#8889: cult behaviour
 Streak#8889: why is coding club just variations of people called james
 Streak#8889: poor guy had all these bottled up
 Streak#8889: what did he do before compsoc
 Taz#9211: i've seen them lmao
 Taz#9211: unironically yes
 JamiesonH#0334: Has anyone here played quake 3
 JamiesonH#0334: Log off get pussy m8
 ron0studios#4591: he stole a lot of ideas and censored other scientists
 Streak#8889: Shoutout to mf Newton
 Streak#8889: For gravity, for light, and all that stuff
 Streak#8889: Like the inverse square law
 Streak#8889: oh that makes sense isn't it like intensity varies inversely with the square root of distance or something?
 ron0studios#4591: because you want decent normals when projecting rays
 ron0studios#4591: its really really really important with raytracing
 JamiesonH#0334: If you say so sir !
 Streak#8889: cuz apparently it's really useful for graphics
 JamiesonH#0334: Ahh
 Streak#8889: 1/sqrt(X)
 Streak#8889: inverse square rooting
 JamiesonH#0334: And its just for square rooting
 ron0studios#4591: even the people overviewing the code were confused
 ron0studios#4591: this is the original code from quake iii
 Streak#8889: I'll only do what we've done dw
 Streak#8889: actual teacher life
 ron0studios#4591: I don't want to spoil myself lol
 ron0studios#4591: we should do it a bit later
 Streak#8889: They're a lot more texty and informative than mine lol
 Streak#8889: I'll see if I can get the slides for 
 Streak#8889: the IEEE 7-something representation
 ron0studios#4591: crucial plot development
 ron0studios#4591: he explained floating points
 JamiesonH#0334: How
 ron0studios#4591: plot
 Streak#8889: Gotta see it through
 Streak#8889: He's set up the story
 ron0studios#4591: yes same
 Streak#8889: Hype for next week though
 ron0studios#4591: 70 slides sheezus
 ron0studios#4591: productivity at its best
 Streak#8889: at least if I counted right my maths went to shit after the test lol
 Streak#8889: Yes not counting the return statement or function definition
 JamiesonH#0334: Is it acc 10 lines of code?
 JamiesonH#0334: Fair lol
 Streak#8889: Which randomly has a mad good square rooting algorithm
 Streak#8889: Yh
 Streak#8889: does he have the functional programming anthology ready at the drop of a hat too lmao
 JamiesonH#0334: Isn't quake 3 like some 90s game ?
 Streak#8889: Mf looked at 10 lines of code and made a 70 page presentation
 Streak#8889: Dudes like halfway through it
 Streak#8889: Quake III's inverse square root algorithm
 JamiesonH#0334: What was it on?
 Taz#9211: cause he'd talked about quake 3 before
 Taz#9211: i have a feeling he already had that presentation prepared
 JamiesonH#0334: I said they did it after taking our lua course which I wrote myself
 JamiesonH#0334: Also do u like my message saying that a member of coding club made this game when it's just my coursework lol
 JamiesonH#0334: What did he do lol
 Streak#8889: His 24 hours are insane
 Streak#8889: Molly Mae would be proud
 Streak#8889: Surely he's got a time machine
 Streak#8889: also Mr Johnsons actually cracked
 ron0studios#4591: He has eluded the kcs council for centuries with ciphers, little is known of his inner machinations, his intentions.
 Streak#8889: the great johnson himself is a man of mystery
 ron0studios#4591: Cool! Makes it exciting!
 ron0studios#4591: Oh we don't know?
 Streak#8889: we'll see ig
 JamiesonH#0334: What's it on
 JamiesonH#0334: Bruh I'm missing Mr Johnson presentation ;-;;
 Streak#8889: everything
 JakeH#2364: Ayo I was afk what did I miss?
 Choopies#5687: oh bruh
 JamiesonH#0334: Our school
 Choopies#5687: is that our school or a random school
 ByName#9795: Oh no, we happen to have pressed some buttons and magically found the solution
 Taz#9211: yep "accidentally solved"
 ByName#9795: Ruin their reputation!
 JamiesonH#0334: Kms
 JamiesonH#0334: Pain the year 8s who claim they accidentally solved 10b on cipher tools are in contention for a prize
 Coloursplash#9680: I literally told someone in my class to make a capybara account and he said Twitter was too much of a hell hole
 Coloursplash#9680: funi
 Coloursplash#9680: huh
 JamiesonH#0334: That's my account
 Coloursplash#9680: wow this man follows the capybara man Twitter account
 JamiesonH#0334: You know this capybara made Godot
 Coloursplash#9680: all that time I spent on the godot docs 🤦‍♂️
 Coloursplash#9680:  this would have been helpful a few weeks ago lol
 ron0studios#4591: Woah thanks!
 Streak#8889: Secondly, think about complex numbers. All qubit states can be written in the form *a|0> + b|1>*, where 'b' is a complex number (including potentially purely real or imaginary numbers).
Since a^2+b^2=1, which gave us that unit circle which we transformed into the one above, for a particular value of 'a' we have a fixed value of 'b'.
But, that value of 'b' is the magnitude of 'b'.
We take the horizontal axis as real numbers, and the vertical axis as imaginary numbers, then find the magnitude of a vector to any point on the graph. That's a way to find the magnitude of a complex number - and the vectors with magnitude 'b' will form a circle.
There's no room to represent that in the above circle, so we use the third dimension. Imagine a circle coming out of the page from the left side of the circle, curving round and re-entering on the right. Every point on the 3D circle is still '1' away from the centre, so a^2+b^2=1 is preserved, we just now can see all of the possibilities of 'b' being a complex number.
If we do that for all points on the circle, joining it with its mirror on the right side, we get a Sphere. The Bloch Sphere.
This is the best representation of a qubit we have - every point on its surface is a quantum state, with 1 and 0 at the top, and equal superpositions around the equator.
 Streak#8889: And it actually doesn't delve into the Bloch Sphere itself - at about 29:20, it talks about that 'Unit Circle State Machine', which has a bunch of states around the side like 0 at the top and 1 on the right. That's almost like a 1-dimensional Bloch Sphere.
The first thing you can do is  *double every angle clockwise*, so 0 stays at the top, the [1/sqrt, 1/sqrt(2)] vector goes to the right, and 1 goes to the bottom. This makes it easier to visualise Gate operations.
That might make it seem like half the circle disappears, but that doesn't actually matter all that much. If you draw diameters from each state on the left to its opposite state on the right, you'll see *they're identical, just multiplied by -1.*
For example, [-1,0] to [1,0] or  [1/sqrt, 1/sqrt(2)] to  [-1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)].
That gives you a graph looking like this, now where |0> points straight up and |1> points straight down.
 Streak#8889: Yeah, Microsoft's video is actually really good - it is rather fast though, so don't hesitate to slow it down or go into further research
 ron0studios#4591: Im going to try follow this lecture, it seems to follow the same structure as your powerpoints
 ron0studios#4591: oh ok
 Streak#8889: If you forego that and just accept it it could be simpler, if a bit less 'complete'
 Streak#8889: I spent a fair bit of the presentation explaining how to get to things and why they're the way they are
 Streak#8889: And ofc ask me any questions you have
 Streak#8889: I'm little busy rn, but ill get some resources together that should help explain
 ron0studios#4591: I don't think I'll be able to get any of the stuff on next weeks session
 ron0studios#4591: if you wouldnt mind shrey, would it be possible whether you can explain some of the concepts at some other time?
 ron0studios#4591: What's next week going to be on?
 ron0studios#4591: Oh no
 ron0studios#4591: I wasnt able to come last wednesday
 ron0studios#4591: holy christ I just checked the powerpoint from the archives
 JamiesonH#0334: Facts
 Streak#8889: every month
 Streak#8889: it always is
 JamiesonH#0334: When is meet programmer pride month
 Streak#8889: Ooh should i make a rainbow version of the compsoc logo for pride month
 JamiesonH#0334: Fair
 Streak#8889: simply brilliant
 Streak#8889: Yes perfectly fine
 Streak#8889: _prism sends its regards_
 JamiesonH#0334: Is it okay to threaten year 8s?
 Streak#8889: should go beef them
 JamiesonH#0334: I asked one guy why his friends stopped coming and he said they were getting made fun of oof
 Streak#8889: that's so sad
 Streak#8889: did they say they couldn't come cause they were being bullied
 JamiesonH#0334: And then the next session Im told this news
 JamiesonH#0334: It sucked bcos I just before that told the offsted inspector that I thought lower school was more accepting bcos some came to prism
 Streak#8889: woo
 JamiesonH#0334: Not all of them
 Streak#8889: long day ig
 Streak#8889: well then
 Streak#8889: ah
 Streak#8889: what do the lower school kids do
 JamiesonH#0334: But then they got bullied and stopped coming rip
 JamiesonH#0334: Prism is just my friend group and a bunch of lower school kids
 Streak#8889: Bros done the maths lmao
 Streak#8889: isn't life full of wonders
 Streak#8889: compsoc's mostly my compsci class, prism's mostly your compsci class
 JamiesonH#0334: Love that
 JamiesonH#0334: 36%
 Streak#8889: What a crazy coincidence
 JamiesonH#0334: Are computer science class has got to have the best ratio of prism attendees in the school tbh
 Streak#8889: wise words indeed
 JamiesonH#0334: Ayy I have this on good authority
 Streak#8889: Unwrapping the psyche of a modern programmer
 JamiesonH#0334: 🤝🤝🤝
 JamiesonH#0334: Apparently it's a trans femme stereotype to be a programmer according to my gf so let's do it
 Streak#8889: us next month fr
 JamiesonH#0334: Alan Turing appreciation club
 Streak#8889: or just combine the clubs
 Streak#8889: soon we'll convert you prismers to compsocers
 JamiesonH#0334: Make snacks tbh
 Streak#8889: amazing strategies we should learn from the pros
 JamiesonH#0334: My prism PowerPoints are meh but I make everyone snacks and harass them to come so it's fine
 Streak#8889: yay
 Streak#8889: i clog it with maths instead
 JamiesonH#0334: (like I do at prism every week)
 JamiesonH#0334: I just mean to say u don't fall for the sin of clogging PowerPoints with words
 Streak#8889: Lol tysm
 JamiesonH#0334: Thanks king
 JamiesonH#0334: You do a good job at making the PowerPoints visually concise and your notes more impactful
 JamiesonH#0334: Dw haha
 Streak#8889: so just ask or something if it's easier
 Streak#8889: the word doc might be a little waffly cause i write how i speak
 JamiesonH#0334: That'd probs be useful
 Streak#8889: or just hte powerpoint
 Streak#8889: the script
 Streak#8889: do you want like my speech notes as well
 JamiesonH#0334: I'll just look at the presentation
 JamiesonH#0334: Oh yeah I remember that haha
 Streak#8889: qubits like the quantum bits which can be in superposition
 JamiesonH#0334: And yeah I was back in school today , thanks
 JamiesonH#0334: Idk what a single one of these words means
 Streak#8889: yeah just a few
 Streak#8889: you been okay with it?
 Streak#8889: rip
 JamiesonH#0334: Just a couple things then
 Streak#8889: Essentially, we went into how Qubits can be represented via the Bloch Sphere, how the Pauli-X, Y, and Z Gates work, the Hadamard Gate and Superposition, and the CX Gate and Entanglement
 JamiesonH#0334: I had covid so I couldn't go ;(
 Streak#8889: lemme pop it in 
 ron0studios#4591: what happened?
 ron0studios#4591: I couldn't come this week wednesday due to exams
 Leavinq#1285: still havent even read any of the books were doing
 Leavinq#1285: i tried to drop at end of year 12 by deliberately messing up my mock and ended up getting an a* its so easy
 Streak#8889: free a*
 Streak#8889: alright mr shakespeare
 Leavinq#1285: then i took english 💀
 Streak#8889: if they say no thats just rude
 Leavinq#1285: i was gonna do that
 Streak#8889: warwick better accept me instantly smh
 Streak#8889: >me taking maths further maths comp sci and physics
 Leavinq#1285: + recomends you have comp sci or phys
 Leavinq#1285: yer
 JamiesonH#0334: Does Warwick need that Logan?
 JamiesonH#0334: You need an A* in maths or further maths at a lot of the top compsci unis
 ByName#9795: Reasonably local + banking/big tech salaries + no student debt = amazing
 Taz#9211: if you find it hard then im fucked
 Leavinq#1285: getting an esports scholarship for osu fuck ur degree apprenticeship nerd shit 😎
 Streak#8889: gonna be making those big bucks
 Streak#8889: big up the finance grind
 Streak#8889: that shits hard
 Streak#8889: if i get an a in further maths then god is real icl
 Streak#8889: flex
 Leavinq#1285: so its literally free
 Leavinq#1285: english i dont even try at all ang get it anyway
 Leavinq#1285: maths easy
 Leavinq#1285: quite easy 2 get tho
 ByName#9795: Only 3 monitors
 Streak#8889: damn those are high af grades
 ByName#9795: Yeah they're with companies: aiming for either JPMC, Goldman, Amazon or PWC (maybe Microsoft but that's further away)
 Leavinq#1285: a* a* a
 Leavinq#1285: ye
 Streak#8889: isn't warwick like really good for compsci as well
 Leavinq#1285: ive only got 3 🥺
 Streak#8889: Imagine moving in on the first day and you see this guy ferrying multiple monitors across the halls
 Leavinq#1285: so the osu grind will come with me and will not do any work at all
 Leavinq#1285: anyway warwick best bc one of their accom is big enough for me to bring my whole pc setup 😎
 Streak#8889: are you doing them with companies? idk how degree apprenticeships work
 Streak#8889: metropolitan?? bros a london underground railway line?
 ByName#9795: All the degree apprenticeships I'm applying for are in London except one I think
 ByName#9795: * liberal metropolitan elite
 Leavinq#1285: tory
 ByName#9795: One of the halls of residence there has wine and cheese evenings and formal dinners....
 Streak#8889: we'll pretend to be posh too
 Streak#8889: let us come visit scotland pls 🙏
 Streak#8889: which is a little dead
 ByName#9795: Yes, the supposedly slightly posh one really far North
 Streak#8889: Lmao yh some people would just stay at home if they went london since they live in it
 Leavinq#1285: london expensive or i live at home so god no
 Streak#8889: St andrews like the one in scotland?? Damn you going mad far
 ByName#9795: St Andrews, Birmingham, Bath, Loughborough, Lancaster and some degree apprenticeships
 Streak#8889: megacorp
 Streak#8889: we'll become like a chain store
 notFenwick#4649: lmao
 Streak#8889: start a branch of compsoc at imperial
 JamiesonH#0334: They say it's a lifestyle full of booze babes and bucks
 Streak#8889: computing in that last choice position 😩
 notFenwick#4649: i applied physics/computing at loughborough but it’s like my last choice
 JamiesonH#0334: I'm going to present on the compsoc uni lifestyle
 Streak#8889: ~~dsa all 3 terms in a row~~
 Streak#8889: what wonderful topics will be chosen
 notFenwick#4649: can’t wait to learn about computers
 Streak#8889: watch compsoc after we leave
 Streak#8889: we'll teams call you in fenwick don't worry
 JamiesonH#0334: I'll be guest speaker
 JamiesonH#0334: Facts
 notFenwick#4649: trueee
 Streak#8889: 😁
 Streak#8889: and you can visit for compsoc innit
 JamiesonH#0334: I like London and my girlfriend lives there and it has good job opportunities
 Streak#8889: ah you're basically in ucl then same thing
 notFenwick#4649: my brother applied ucl i think if that counts 🥺
 JamiesonH#0334: Not many people apply London tbf
 Streak#8889: and jamie not about anything but that london uni life
 Streak#8889: logan and fenwick not about that london uni life?
 Streak#8889: Lol
 JamiesonH#0334: I could've said ICL too but I thought I'd be nice
 Streak#8889: oh yeah physicist that's what they teach you in physical education right
 Streak#8889: abbreviation station
 notFenwick#4649: not physician physicist >:((((
 JamiesonH#0334: Sorry I don't wanna write them all out
 JamiesonH#0334: I already said but imperial UCL KCL QMUL and Greenwich
 Streak#8889: mf physician
 notFenwick#4649: luff bruh
 JamiesonH#0334: Don't remind me
 notFenwick#4649: physics/natural sciences at cambridge, durham, warwick, york, loughborough
 Leavinq#1285: warwick nottingham bath birmingham loughborough leicester
 Streak#8889: what degree are you doing then?
 notFenwick#4649: i’m very intelligent
 Streak#8889: bros built diff
 notFenwick#4649: not doing computing 😔
 Streak#8889: only jamey said iirc
 Streak#8889: yo    outta curiosity what unis did you guys apply to?
 JamiesonH#0334: U put all of them
 JamiesonH#0334: Why would they do that
 JamiesonH#0334: Lol what
 ron0studios#4591: instead of all of them
 ron0studios#4591: Are you allowed to only put your top 10 gcse's?
 Streak#8889: 😭
 Streak#8889: like what if i made a typo and my uni application errored out or something
 ron0studios#4591: yh
 Streak#8889: even applying to unis i'd be so stressed
 Streak#8889: whew
 Streak#8889: whe big moment
 ron0studios#4591: idk university applications scare me
 JamiesonH#0334: Why haha
 ron0studios#4591: oh god i feel tensed looking at it idk why
 JamiesonH#0334: Look mum , I got into Oxford
 ron0studios#4591: bcs the US school system is just multiple choice
 ron0studios#4591: in the US they spend a year doing stuff you cover in further maths really well
 JamiesonH#0334: We just call it differentiation and integration
 ron0studios#4591: there's a reason it takes 3 years for american ppl to graduate
 ron0studios#4591: we do university stuff a year early
 JamiesonH#0334: No we do calculus stuff we just don't call it that
 Choopies#5687: i guess americans are just superiour
 Choopies#5687: wait do we not
 JamiesonH#0334: So true
 ron0studios#4591: yh lol
 ron0studios#4591: to be fair calculus is just mathematical analysis
 Choopies#5687: me when films use trigonometry to show someones clever: 🤯
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah lol
 JamiesonH#0334: I just mean in maths we never say the word calculus
 ron0studios#4591: i like how linear algebra sounds deceptively simple bcs it sounds like y = mx+c
 Choopies#5687: math
 ron0studios#4591: i mean its simple calculus
 JamiesonH#0334: But in UK it's never mentioned
 Streak#8889: same team that did cipher challenge so easily ofc ofc
 JamiesonH#0334: It's weird how in America they use the word calculus so much
 Choopies#5687: doing computer science a level
 Choopies#5687: yeah true tbh
 ron0studios#4591: there's probably a really sweaty year 7 team out there
 Choopies#5687: and the only marks from the last question
 Choopies#5687: because i swear in year 7 i would have got 3/30
 Choopies#5687: i want to see what the yr 7s got lol
 ron0studios#4591: oh yeah in my head
 JamiesonH#0334: Can you do multivariate calculus rudrrayan?
 Choopies#5687: 10
 Choopies#5687: very infuriating
 ron0studios#4591: yh it struck me at first as well
 JamiesonH#0334: Year 7s be wilding
 JamiesonH#0334: I thought it was for year 7-11 why are they making you do multivariate calculus
 Choopies#5687: i got stuck on one question and my teammate ||was even slower||
 ron0studios#4591: oh wait sorry i misread that as 31, i was being sarcastic
 ron0studios#4591: what year are you in?
 Choopies#5687: lmao
 ron0studios#4591: yh thats garbage
 Choopies#5687: i think we got 21 which is pretty bad lol
 Choopies#5687: niceeee 30/30
 Choopies#5687: anyway
 Choopies#5687: i tried bivariate calculatics
 Choopies#5687: ????????????????????????
 ron0studios#4591: *(the question was to print out the name of the question)*
 Choopies#5687: lmaoooo
 ron0studios#4591: we got wannacry and had 30 minutes to remove it before our PCs blew up
 Choopies#5687: anyway
 Choopies#5687: i clicked it and it gave my computer a virus
 ron0studios#4591: the last question was some multivariate calculus
 JamiesonH#0334: It was so easy
 Choopies#5687: !!!!
 JamiesonH#0334: I got 50/30
 ron0studios#4591: yh
 Choopies#5687: got 27
 Choopies#5687: it was fairly easy but the last question was too hard
 Choopies#5687: nicee
 JamiesonH#0334: Epic
 JamiesonH#0334: And inefficient methods of solving it
 JamiesonH#0334: Just dozens of if statements
 JamiesonH#0334: Coding the first two layers is really annoying
 JamiesonH#0334: Doing two step OLL so I can write less OLL algorithms out
 JamiesonH#0334: I'm not doing full OLL
 JamiesonH#0334: And the top cross as well
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah
 henindapen#2396: So does yours do the first two layers?
 henindapen#2396: Python lol
 JamiesonH#0334: Idk if he did his in java too
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah🐱🐱
 Professor Chaos#9143: Should just combine the code
 JamiesonH#0334: Fucked up innit
 JamiesonH#0334: His can solve the second half but not the first , nine the other way round
 JamiesonH#0334: My Rubik's cube solver now does the opposites of Henry's
 JamiesonH#0334: Spain no s
 Streak#8889: Sadge
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah , hilarious !
 ron0studios#4591: lol
 JamiesonH#0334: The title is that until you hit the maximum recursion depth
 ron0studios#4591: recursion++
 ron0studios#4591: I'll do an epq on "is the epq a valid method of quantifying a person's ability to question whether the epq is a valid method of quantifying a person's ability to question whether the epq is..."
 JamiesonH#0334: Should have been me
 JamiesonH#0334: 💔
 ByName#9795: But yes, it's more creating a line of argument to evaluate a point. Iirc there's at least 1 session on how to choose a topic and question
 ByName#9795: Epq-ception
 ByName#9795: Do your epq on the epq
 Streak#8889: they'll have to admit i'm right
 JamiesonH#0334: Argue that the epq should be more research based
 Streak#8889: boutta blow some epq examiners mind then
 Streak#8889: sounds cool
 JamiesonH#0334: I think so
 Streak#8889: Like almost debate-y?
 Streak#8889: individuality 😩
 Streak#8889: can't be the 10000th person with the same take
 JamiesonH#0334: You research something but only to the end of making an arguement about it
 Streak#8889: might as well say something scandalous, be more fun
 JamiesonH#0334: I don't think it's really a research paper kinda thing
 JamiesonH#0334: I mean Ben knows more than me but it doesn't have to be a hot take
 Streak#8889: what's a hot qc take
 Streak#8889: that sounds interesting i suppose
 Streak#8889: have a hot take in the title and then research evidence for it
 Streak#8889: so like
 Streak#8889: huh i was thinking of it as like a simplified research paper but ig not
 JamiesonH#0334: Like the impacts are much more important to the essay than the technical side
 JamiesonH#0334: I mean isn't the point of the epq to research something and then argue a hypothetical
 Streak#8889: Like it's just hypothetical
 Streak#8889: and more waffley if you know what i mean
 Streak#8889: doable
 Streak#8889: cause researching impacts seems less like
 Streak#8889: btw   would you guys say you should focus on like the actual thing itself, like bits of the algorithms, or the impacts on society?
 Streak#8889: I'll be starting the EPQ soon and I'll probably come up with a bunch of different ideas relating to QC, so i can tell you what they are
 ron0studios#4591: yh
 Taz#9211:  you dont do epq till y12 though right?
 ron0studios#4591: both of which are relatively mathsy
 ron0studios#4591: I wanted to research on something either quantum-based or looking at the latest reinforcement learning techniques
 JamiesonH#0334: I think either of those would be fine tbh
 Streak#8889: effect on profits hehe me like money
 Streak#8889: and is it better to do something like that than like
 Streak#8889: Like would effect on say climate change be better than effect on society?
 Streak#8889: does it need to be specific?
 Streak#8889: hmm
 ByName#9795: Also can be useful if you need to talk about it in interviews and stuff like that because it shows you understand the context of it too
 ByName#9795: ^this
 JamiesonH#0334: so you can be a more well rounded person !
 JamiesonH#0334: its good to do something thats not just technical and ties in societal issues and stuff tho
 ByName#9795: It's not just about writing the actual dissertation
 ByName#9795: I think most of the marks are for actually organising and evaluating it and that sort of thing
 ByName#9795: I did mine about technology in general then did like evaluation of benefits and costs for a bunch of things
 JamiesonH#0334: Mine was going to be about music but I quit because cba
 Streak#8889: Would be relatively math-y but there's a lot to talk about
 Streak#8889: i was planning to do something on a niche part of quantum, like chemistry, finance or machine learning
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah you can make a code project but apparently they rarely get good marks
 ByName#9795: Also something you can do primary research for easily
 ByName#9795: Actually coding something would be even harder
 ByName#9795: Epq needs to be something you can research lots and write about lots
 JamiesonH#0334: What areas of computer science are you most interested in?
 JamiesonH#0334: I mean EPQ is not that suited to technical things
 ron0studios#4591: anything more technical tho?
 ron0studios#4591: oh cool
 JamiesonH#0334: Or something similar but for quantum computers
 JamiesonH#0334: Maybe somethinf like "to what extent will AI impact industry"
 ron0studios#4591: I desperately need ideas
 ron0studios#4591: if so whats the subject?
 ron0studios#4591: anyone doing an epq in CS?
 ByName#9795: Ah
 JamiesonH#0334: its a bot not ai
 ByName#9795: Java AI?
 Karan.7519#8652: I see
 ron0studios#4591: it was a late christmas present I got just before the club started
 Karan.7519#8652: OK nice 👍
 ron0studios#4591: I just got it back today
 ron0studios#4591: yh
 Karan.7519#8652:  did you leave a wrapped object behind yesterday in CPR4
 Choopies#5687: hope you get better
 JamiesonH#0334: could someone contact maxwell bcos i was talking to him
 ron0studios#4591: Oh ok
 JamiesonH#0334: yeah but i didnt really talk to you or face you ]
 ron0studios#4591: Probably going to have to do a test
 ron0studios#4591: I was next to you wasn't I?
 JamiesonH#0334: is he on here?
 JamiesonH#0334: i was only really near maxwell
 JamiesonH#0334: tbf i didnt really come close to you
 JamiesonH#0334: hurrah
 Coloursplash#9680: i guess masks do work
 Coloursplash#9680: ive done a test and its negative
 Taz#9211: it's calm
 JamiesonH#0334: thanks 🙂
 JamiesonH#0334: i had a negative test on the tuesday and i didnt really feel ill on wed so i came in, sorry for potentially putting you at risk but i think you'll be okay
 Taz#9211: get well soon ❤️
 Taz#9211: alright ty for letting us know
 Taz#9211: long day
 Streak#8889: valid
 JamiesonH#0334: bcos i felt ill 😉
 JamiesonH#0334: and comsci was just a coursework lesson so i only really did one
 JamiesonH#0334: i bunked two lessons today
 JamiesonH#0334: online school is a bit shit
 JamiesonH#0334: im alright
 Streak#8889: Yeah you alright g
 Coloursplash#9680: we hope you feel okay
 Streak#8889:  
 JamiesonH#0334: @everyone i tested positive for covid so if you were at computing society on wednesday you should probs take a test sorry lol
 JamiesonH#0334: oh shit i should have told you lot
 JamiesonH#0334: but the ai would hopefully be able to pick up on the patterns with a training set that is of realistic size
 JamiesonH#0334: either way its still a huge number
 JamiesonH#0334: yeah some of them would be the same cube but a rotation away
 Streak#8889: Like just a rotation of the entire cube or a colour change away
 Streak#8889: Some of those states would be similar though right?
 JamiesonH#0334: i mean if theres 45 possible new states from each state then it would be 45^n
 Streak#8889: At least 2 possible new states each turn is 2^n where n is depth
 Streak#8889: Wouldn't it take unreasonably long to train then? As in exponentially?
 Streak#8889: emoji fail moment
 Streak#8889: :thonk:
 JamiesonH#0334: also if you go by the standard that most cubers use , theres 45 different possible turns of the cube that you  can do at any time , so if you were to train this thing it would take a huge training set
 JamiesonH#0334: yes but if you train the neural network eventually it will have seen enough that it can recognise all the patterns , without having seen an amount of labelled cubes that is out of control
 Streak#8889: Won't that quickly spiral out of control then?
 JamiesonH#0334: yeah
 Streak#8889: So need to be separately labeled 2
 JamiesonH#0334: yeah
 Streak#8889: Wouldn't those two result in different looking cubes
 Streak#8889: Next move could be rotating the side below it while parallel, or rotating perpendicular to that
 Streak#8889: Like first move is rotating a side sure
 JamiesonH#0334: im not sure whatt you mean
 Streak#8889: Cause surely there's a lot
 Streak#8889: Or do you have to go through all the generic options
 Streak#8889: Is it possible to train an AI to recognise the cube's state's depth from being solved
 Streak#8889: Hmm
 JamiesonH#0334: i suppose that would work, then when youre getting the ai to solve it you just pass it every possible state that you can get to in 1 move from the current state, and then it performs the move that the ai says puts the cube closest to being solved
 Streak#8889: qiskit gang
 Streak#8889: I.. think so? Something like that was what I was thinking as well
 ron0studios#4591: I'm probably going to use qiskit
 JamiesonH#0334: so you train it by turning one move and then giving the network that state with the label of 1, then do another move and pass the network that state with a lable of 2 and so forward?
 JamiesonH#0334: that makes sense tbf
 Coloursplash#9680: thx!
 Streak#8889: Qiskit, Cirq, and Q#
 Coloursplash#9680: what were the names of the quantum computing libraries?
 Streak#8889: Approximately yeah
 JamiesonH#0334: so the network outputs how many moves away you are?
 Streak#8889: Hold on I'll send a link
 Streak#8889: After 1 spin theres just 2 possible generic faces, line at top/bottom or line at centre
 Streak#8889: Keeping it abstracted from colours and rotation, just same or not same
 Streak#8889: By having like an example cube to train on which does a single spin at a time and records it's state
 JamiesonH#0334: but i think it would be very hard to program
 JamiesonH#0334: yes theoretically it could
 Streak#8889: But that only looks close to solved, could a computer look at that and realise it's actually a high degree of complexity?
 JamiesonH#0334: but how would it calculate what layer of complexity its at
 Streak#8889: Then it moves to moving from 51st to 50th
 Streak#8889: Even if that involves going up to 60 and back
 Streak#8889: But you could train an AI how to get, say from the 52nd level of complexity down to the 51st
 JamiesonH#0334: i dont think there's any way you can solve it where its literally a linear line from each cube in the wrong place to every cube in the right place
 Streak#8889: Is there only one way to solve it, do you have to do the mess up or is that just to make things easier to remember for humans
 Streak#8889: As opposed to the regular cubing method
 Streak#8889: Then work downwards, moving down a degree at a time
 JamiesonH#0334: yeah but the ai would have to reduce its own fitness everytime it performs an algorithm
 Streak#8889: Like looking for similarities across complexity
 Streak#8889: Etc
 Streak#8889: Then another rotation, which either looks like 3 lines of colours or 4 square of same, two 2 length lines of same, and a unique corner
 Streak#8889: Then one step away is just one rotation, which all looks like 6 identical colours and a line of another colour
 ByName#9795: What about the Shakespeare's monkeys approach?
 JamiesonH#0334: that would be extremley complicated i think
 Streak#8889: Like on one end you have a solved cube
 Streak#8889: Are there like degrees of 'messed up'ness that you could calculate
 JamiesonH#0334: tho if you had a powerful enough ai it would probably be able to detect the neccesary patterns to avoid that issue
 JamiesonH#0334: because each step requires you mess up the cube a considerable amount
 JamiesonH#0334: and the bot you use to solve the cube would have to be pretty sophisticated, like it couldnt use any of the solving methods a human does, because if you gave the bot a cube state which is halfway through an a step then the cube will look like it is completley messed up and the bot would probably just start over again with the solve
 Streak#8889: hmm
 JamiesonH#0334: bcos bots can find the optimal solution anyway
 JamiesonH#0334: theres not much point in using an ai for a rubiks cube
 Streak#8889: Like you're just adding complexity for no reason lmao
 JamiesonH#0334: yeah lol
 Streak#8889: but then you might as well just use the bot to solve the cube
 JamiesonH#0334: so its not bruteforcing
 JamiesonH#0334: if you have a bot that can solve the cube, you just pass the state of the cube to that bot , it returns how many more moves are needed to solve it and thats your fitness
 Streak#8889: Since at that point you're just bruteforcing
 JamiesonH#0334: yes but it would be extremley complicated
 Streak#8889: Is there a way to do it without calculating future moves
 JamiesonH#0334: it would be the number of further moves needed to solve it
 Streak#8889: Is there like a fitness function for the cube? Or is it just liked solved/not solved
 JamiesonH#0334: my cube solving bot will use CFOP which is probably 60 moves ish
 Streak#8889: something something next KegsHACK 😶 😶
 Streak#8889: Maybe I'll do a little research and see
 Streak#8889: Hmm
 JamiesonH#0334: it solves the rubiks cube in 2 steps but each step has like 2 billion different possible states
 Streak#8889: Yknow that's not actually a bad idea
 JamiesonH#0334: yeah its called Kociemba's algorithm
 Coloursplash#9680: quantum computing project 👀
 JamiesonH#0334: the way you solve a rubiks cube is literally you recognise a pattern and then perform the corresponding algorithms for each step of the solve
 Coloursplash#9680: there are algorithms for an ai to do it, they’re just not very efficient. It is possible to always solve it jn 20 moves but that requires super computers to process
 JamiesonH#0334: lol shussshh
 Streak#8889: Ahem anyways
 Streak#8889: I mean, probably? I don't know much about cubing so idk if there's patterns for a neural network to pick up on
 JamiesonH#0334: what was the other submission to KegsHACK
 Streak#8889: go get that
 JamiesonH#0334: i wanna try do that
 JamiesonH#0334: do u think an ai could solve a rubiks cube
 Streak#8889: just submit it for y13 epq ez
 Streak#8889: the fated new completion
 JamiesonH#0334: busy*
 JamiesonH#0334: im bussy
 Coloursplash#9680: okay
 JamiesonH#0334: no
 Coloursplash#9680: would you mind explaining the second half of your nickname?
 JamiesonH#0334: i wasnt judging :0
 Coloursplash#9680: it lets me wear glasses okay don’t judge
 Coloursplash#9680: yes
 JamiesonH#0334: starry night face mask right?
 Coloursplash#9680: yes
 JamiesonH#0334: were u with rudrrayan
 Coloursplash#9680: I managed it somehow
 Coloursplash#9680: erm
 JamiesonH#0334: how do you turn up "randomly"
 Coloursplash#9680: also I was the one who just randomly turned up for the presentation yesterday
 Coloursplash#9680: it looks like rono and I will be teaming up
 Choopies#5687: Unless year 11 is full of rlly good people
 Choopies#5687: tbh i actually have a decent chance of 3rd place
 Choopies#5687: its funded by someone else
 ByName#9795: It's not the school itself
 JamiesonH#0334: How the fuck does the school have £600 spare to give away
 Streak#8889: I'm in year 11 innit lemme in
 Choopies#5687: thanks for all the support
 Choopies#5687: i will
 Choopies#5687: !!!!!
 JamiesonH#0334: believe in yourself!!!
 Choopies#5687: seems fun
 Choopies#5687: but im going to do it anyway
 Choopies#5687: yeah im defo not better than him then
 JamiesonH#0334: idk any yr11s other than him but hes pretty goated
 Choopies#5687: lol
 Choopies#5687: because in 10 theres a few but i reckon i might be better than them possibly
 JamiesonH#0334: rudrrayan is beast
 Choopies#5687: are there any people rlly good in yr 11
 JamiesonH#0334: rip
 JamiesonH#0334: yo wtf
 Choopies#5687: saying its only year 7-11
 Choopies#5687: that could actually be really good
 Choopies#5687: wait
 JamiesonH#0334: send pic
 Choopies#5687: 3rd 100
 JamiesonH#0334: bruh
 Choopies#5687: 2nd £200
 Choopies#5687: winner gets £300
 Choopies#5687: lemme send a pic
 Choopies#5687: no
 JamiesonH#0334: that is a coding comp
 JamiesonH#0334: we just did the kegs hackathon wdym lol
 Choopies#5687: is it just for our school
 Choopies#5687: wait theres a coding comp?
 JamiesonH#0334: Top layer is all algorithmic so easy , but bottom layer is more intuitive , so harder to program
 JamiesonH#0334: That's exactly what i was thinking
 henindapen#2396: Top layer is all cfop, and tbh im not too sure with how to approach the rest of it yet…
 JamiesonH#0334: Elden ring CNT is better
 notFenwick#4649: yea it’s a rly good collab gave up on most of the grandmaster maps tho
 Streak#8889: that was cool
 Streak#8889: Oh yeahh i remember hearing about a 2020 spring TAS
 Streak#8889: poor madeline
 Streak#8889: jeeeeeeeeeeeeez
 Streak#8889: wtffff#
 Streak#8889: 79k
 notFenwick#4649: got 79k deaths 400 hours on my main save as well 😔
 notFenwick#4649: mount everest is one of my favourites it’s rly tough and it’s got a sick b side lol
 notFenwick#4649: honestly anything’s good
 notFenwick#4649: the big dadbot collabs are nuts like the 2020 spring one and stuff
 notFenwick#4649: yea  the stuff they put in is insane
 Streak#8889: _only_
 Streak#8889: *only
 Streak#8889: talented devs to get that out of celeste
 notFenwick#4649: also i just checked only 190 berries oops
 notFenwick#4649: like teleporting and stuff it’s cool
 Streak#8889: mechanics?
 notFenwick#4649: really cool mechanics couldn’t be bothered with the weird secrets
 notFenwick#4649: yeah glyph is fun
 Streak#8889: i've heard it's a really good map
 Streak#8889: I wanna try Glyph though
 Streak#8889: I messed around with Everest a bit before but i nearly lost my savefile so i deleted it lol
 notFenwick#4649: also havre u tried out modded shit yet
 notFenwick#4649: yeah lol the first screens are never tooooo bad tho
 Streak#8889: doing the last screens first try 👀
 Streak#8889: idt i could c side golden
 Streak#8889: speak for yourself
 Streak#8889: mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
 notFenwick#4649: 192 berries i think but that’s with c side goldens which are basically cheating
 Streak#8889: fuck resort onwards lmao
 Streak#8889: and idt i've done it but old site can't be bad
 notFenwick#4649: yeah done a few
 Streak#8889: I mean normal Forsaken golden is calm
 notFenwick#4649: if u don’t have the demo bind it’s not recent
 Streak#8889: have you done other Goldens?
 notFenwick#4649: lol good luck i couldn’t do it
 Streak#8889: guess i'll just need the fastest double press in the land
 Streak#8889: yh i'm not cause I think my game still says matt instead of maddy
 notFenwick#4649: otherwise it’s rly annoying to get with weird positioning i got stuck there until i was able to rebind lol
 notFenwick#4649: yea brutal
 Streak#8889: cuz i don't have like a demodash bind
 Streak#8889: I'm not sure if I'm on later updates
 Streak#8889: ohh
 notFenwick#4649: they made it easier with 1.4 i think
 Streak#8889: i swear to bind two keys to one command you have to actually go edit the config file
 Streak#8889: Do you play on keyboard?
 notFenwick#4649: the positioning just needs to be close to the spikes it’s stupid easy once u get that
 notFenwick#4649: u bind space to two keys and press them fast away from eachother
 notFenwick#4649: do u want to know how i did it lol
 notFenwick#4649: oh shit yeah
 Streak#8889: dear god
 Streak#8889: Where you have to spikejump while jumping away
 notFenwick#4649: actually scrap that have a look at the il record for chapter 1 lol
 notFenwick#4649: tas is fucking insane
 Streak#8889: I sweat TAS is like 1min
 notFenwick#4649: yea starts to get nuts when u go any lower
 Streak#8889: Mfs faster than me wtf
 notFenwick#4649: mines just under 1:10 i think
 Streak#8889: i practised that so much lmao
 notFenwick#4649: jeez fast
 Streak#8889: i think my faster chapter 1's like 1min 10-20s?
 notFenwick#4649: yeah lmao it’s a pain the first time
 Streak#8889: and it just took ages
 Streak#8889: I had to do another one of those big walljumps to get over spikes
 Streak#8889: I got started on dashless ch1, I'll show you the screen i got to
 notFenwick#4649: oh yea have u done the dashless golden for chapter 1? and what’s ur fastest chapter 1 time
 JamiesonH#0334: rawr
 Streak#8889: .ban jamie
 JamiesonH#0334: elden ring better
 notFenwick#4649: sorry it’s the best game jamie
 JamiesonH#0334: compsoc celeste channel when?
 Streak#8889: pain
 notFenwick#4649: it sucks lol
 Streak#8889: soooo
 notFenwick#4649: yeah
 Streak#8889: I've never gotten that
 Streak#8889: and fall back into the previous room?
 Streak#8889: the one where you go into a new room and have to walljump so you don't land on the floor?
 notFenwick#4649: i’m technically faster on mirror temple b side by a little bit but there’s this dumbass thirty second skip that’s like a two frame input for a really small jump that u can’t retry at all
 notFenwick#4649: uhh
 Streak#8889: do you do a-sides or do you do mirror temple and reflection b sides?
 Streak#8889: those feel so good to run wtf
 Streak#8889: but the dopamine rush of the last two subchapters
 Streak#8889: annoying af you have to go get the jellyfish every time you fail as well
 Streak#8889: time to try ig
 notFenwick#4649: regrabbing oops
 Streak#8889: hmm
 notFenwick#4649: the dash regrab stuff is awkward always but in general refraining as late as possible while still getting the boost after dashing gets u way more height
 notFenwick#4649: if i remember there’s like this 2 by  2 dot in the moon stone stuff that u line one of ur feet over? i’d have to try it a couple times to find out which one it is lmao u can look it up i think
 Streak#8889: and then what you dash up regrab and that's enough to reach the top?
 Streak#8889: like the first jellyfish throw
 Streak#8889: what's even the positioning for it?
 Streak#8889: I'm practising on a non assist mode savefile so i can't do that but i only got it once lmao
 notFenwick#4649: did it a few times but wasn’t very consistent and it’s like ages into the run lmao
 Streak#8889: Nearly every time i try it i end up just assist moding past that bit cause i'm stuck there for ages
 Streak#8889: oml that weird shit
 notFenwick#4649: i gave up trying to speedrun farewell when i started trying the weird jelly skip where u go past all the key rooms
 notFenwick#4649: lmao maths lessons for me
 notFenwick#4649: yea got 7k ish from base game
 Streak#8889: in physics lessons tryna to that
 notFenwick#4649: i think i got one like 120 deaths not trying to speedrun
 Streak#8889: that fucked me up lol
 Streak#8889: I had like 10k from base game and nearly 5k from Farewell alone
 notFenwick#4649: yea it’s nuts
 Streak#8889: i was above 4k lmao
 notFenwick#4649: it took me like 3000 deaths the first time lmao
 Streak#8889: Idt i've even done all red berries casually
 Streak#8889: honestly idk why people do drugs literally just play farewell
 Streak#8889: farewell is top crack
 Streak#8889: cringe take
 Streak#8889: i lose motivation at stubbornness and reconciliation every time lmao it just becomes a normal run and i keep dying
 notFenwick#4649: i’ve been meaning to go for the 175 berry run for a bit but it takes ages lmao
 JamiesonH#0334: fax
 notFenwick#4649: farewell is for nerds
 Streak#8889: at some point i decided i had too much self esteem and to try that
 Streak#8889: have you tried running Farewell?
 Streak#8889: i wanna see this run lmao
 JamiesonH#0334: 35 basically = 45 imo
 Streak#8889: there is a god among us
 Streak#8889: 🙏 🙏
 notFenwick#4649: lol it’s 45 haven’t done a full run in a while i could get 40 i think
 JamiesonH#0334: heyyyyyy
 JamiesonH#0334: oh hes here
 JamiesonH#0334: he doesnt really check here lol
 Streak#8889: BROOOOOOOOOO
 Streak#8889: 35
 Streak#8889: WTF
 Streak#8889: i suck my best is like 1h20
 JamiesonH#0334: his record is 35 mins i think
 Streak#8889: what's your time?
 JamiesonH#0334: he does
 Streak#8889:  do you speedrun?
 JamiesonH#0334: fenwick is goated at celeste
 Streak#8889: plus maybe it wont be shit at the game like me 😁
 Streak#8889: thats so fun
 Streak#8889: when they invent time machines imma go back in time and do that for kegshack
 Streak#8889: like celeste
 Streak#8889: imagine an ai which speedruns
 JamiesonH#0334: oof
 JamiesonH#0334:   what method does ur program use to solve the cube, ie beginers  method, CFOP etc
 Streak#8889: Omg
 Streak#8889: speedruns
 JamiesonH#0334: you know how it isssss
 JamiesonH#0334: record is 2.5 mins
 JamiesonH#0334: i have one on my shelf
 Streak#8889: too many sides what does it think its a football
 Streak#8889: get zis abomination out of my sight
 JamiesonH#0334: uhhhhh nah imma do megaminx instead
 Streak#8889: quicker program ez
 Streak#8889: just do the 2 by 2 cube you have lol
 JamiesonH#0334: fr
 Streak#8889: why animate just imagine
 JamiesonH#0334: very much janky
 JamiesonH#0334: but ive fixed it to work now but without animations
 Streak#8889: perspective poggers
 Streak#8889: ooh
 Streak#8889: every turn just close the window and reopen it with the new layout as the original
 Streak#8889: Lmao
 JamiesonH#0334: and i could get it to turn with animations but only if you hadnt rotated it already
 JamiesonH#0334: i found a tutorial which basically just uses maths transfomations and stuff to turn a 3d cube into a 2d image
 JamiesonH#0334: not built in
 Streak#8889: does java do 3d stuff well?
 Streak#8889: rip
 JamiesonH#0334: nah i was making it usable for a human in like 1 3d interactive space first
 JamiesonH#0334: because the 3d graphics in java were too annoying bcos i wanted to animate the turns
 Streak#8889: the main part
 Streak#8889: is that not
 JamiesonH#0334: i gave up before i got to the solving part
 Streak#8889: did you not get yours working rip
 Streak#8889: Lmao
 JamiesonH#0334: if he gets it anywhere near working he has already succeeded me
 Streak#8889: damn  following jamie's footsteps
 JamiesonH#0334: which is cool bcos thats exactly what i did in yr12
 JamiesonH#0334: apparently your friend henry's project for year 12 is a self solving rubiks cube
 JamiesonH#0334: Make sure to like and subscribe !
 Streak#8889: profiting off of examiners
 Streak#8889: bros getting free views off his nea
 JamiesonH#0334: Because it shows the phases of development 😁
 JamiesonH#0334: Ez dub
 JamiesonH#0334: I found out today that I can put links to all the YouTube videos I've made in my coursework write up and get marks for it lol
 Choopies#5687: damn thanks so much!
 JamiesonH#0334: And London is nicer than being in Cambridge for me personally
 JamiesonH#0334: Imperial has higher average salary on leaving anyway
 JamiesonH#0334: It's a good uni obviously but I'm not fussed
 JamiesonH#0334: Why would I
 ron0studios#4591: Why not Cambridge?
 Streak#8889: Ben's just committed to the RE grind ig
 Streak#8889: No delay
 Streak#8889: damn I think I threw mine away frame 1 after I got home
 ByName#9795: Also started using the office to store my books
 ByName#9795: Some under my bed, some in a cupboard
 ByName#9795: Various boxes in places
 JamiesonH#0334: where do u keep it all lol
 ByName#9795: I have literally everything going back to like year 1
 JamiesonH#0334: how do you still have those from 3 years ago
 ByName#9795: ?
 JamiesonH#0334: how
 ByName#9795:  12 maker from ages ago that I did - think it was in exam conditions so representative
 JamiesonH#0334: still cant decide between computing with AI or with robotics at imperial but nevermind
 JamiesonH#0334: what you sayin ?!?!?!
 Choopies#5687: thanks alot
 Choopies#5687: alright ima have a go at tha
 Choopies#5687: for and against
 ByName#9795: I thought it was more trying to reach a 'reasoned argument' so you'd have to find ways of making it so each thing you say links back to that
 Choopies#5687: and then just talk about that
 Choopies#5687: like for example for that question "the sahifah was written by ... and therefore it has importance"
 Choopies#5687: can you just write facts about each book and then link it to the question do you think
 Choopies#5687: oh yeah
 ByName#9795: 3 of the marks are for spag though i think
 Choopies#5687: yeah it is
 ByName#9795: I think I always did intro, paragraph for, paragraph against, conclusion
 Choopies#5687: but yeah the hard one
 Choopies#5687: acc no its 15 lol
 Choopies#5687: acc no its 12
 Choopies#5687: or 16 i forgot
 Choopies#5687: yeah
 Choopies#5687: like for example if it's "are all the books the same importance" can you just waffle about each book
 ByName#9795: Are they the 12 markers?
 Professor Chaos#9143: Remember your sources of wisdom and authority
 Choopies#5687: anyway do you have to just write facts in the d question
 Choopies#5687: we have them next week and I'm just starting to learn about most things
 Choopies#5687: im so screwed
 Choopies#5687: lmao
 Professor Chaos#9143: PTSD
 Choopies#5687: can i even ask about r.e is that ok
 Choopies#5687: we have mocks soon - does anyone know how to write like a d question
 JamiesonH#0334: uhhh mods?!?!?!
 Choopies#5687: does anyone remember their r.e exam
 ron0studios#4591: Hardcore nazist
 JamiesonH#0334: I wanna know  s political standpoint
 ByName#9795: Hmm uses lots of big words and the sort of borderline faux intellectual style that has become rather preeminent
 JamiesonH#0334: I think everyone says this tho
 JamiesonH#0334: Idk tho , they could just choose not to publish certain articles
 JamiesonH#0334: Its open to contributions from anyone so I don't think it has much of a position
 ByName#9795: Ok good
 JamiesonH#0334: Looks like it isn't when I look at their front page articles
 ByName#9795: I don't want to get a bunch of rightwing cookies
 JamiesonH#0334: I remember reading this article that sucked
 ByName#9795: What is back bench
 ByName#9795: Then the rest of the class and the teacher not wanting to get involved so I ended up doing a lot of arguing...
 ByName#9795: There was him and some other people just arguing with people and coming up with what about this tangents
 ByName#9795: Half of us were
 JamiesonH#0334: He's like a cringe libertarian or something
 Streak#8889: stfu man
 Streak#8889: was the entire class not like
 ByName#9795: And so shouldn't be talked about in state schools
 ByName#9795: He's the one that spent half the masculinity lesson arguing with Chumbley because it was 'political'
 Streak#8889: Come again
 JamiesonH#0334: Nah Ben was arguing pro genocide
 Streak#8889: lets go ben standing up for rights
 JamiesonH#0334: Idk he has a sister at cchs I think
 JamiesonH#0334: He's probs some kinda bigot but idk him very well
 Streak#8889: is his little brother in our year or smth cause i can think of a particular idiot who sounds quite like him
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah lol
 ByName#9795: I ended up arguing with him quite a lot in that one PSHE lesson
 Streak#8889: those kinds of people
 Streak#8889: is he one of like
 ByName#9795: Not Tory, more right wing than that
 JamiesonH#0334: About how systemic racism in America isnt real
 JamiesonH#0334: I read one of his articles and it was funny
 Streak#8889: but the next years got canceled for covid so never met the guy again
 JamiesonH#0334: He's an idiot
 Streak#8889: met him like once in a speech competition a few years ago
 Streak#8889: haven't a clue
 JamiesonH#0334: I thought it was prajwal Pandey
 JamiesonH#0334: That guy sucks
 Streak#8889: prajwal pandeep strikes again
 JamiesonH#0334: And then prajwal beat me , Mr Tory boy debtaer pro
 JamiesonH#0334: I was bullshitting so much bcos I didn't have a clueb
 JamiesonH#0334: It was something to do with heroin production in Afghanistan
 ByName#9795: Diplomacy 101
 ByName#9795: I think they ended up with north Korea as president of the UN
 JamiesonH#0334: But I had no idea what it was on about and I just won because I said I'll vote for you if you vote for me to like everyone in the room
 ByName#9795: I helped out with the year 10 one and it was funny
 ByName#9795: What was your plan!
 JamiesonH#0334: I almost had to speak in front of our whole year because I came first in the vote for best plan or something
 Streak#8889: abolish france, etc etc
 ByName#9795: But they used to do it in like y10 and we did in y8?
 Streak#8889: modern day crusade
 Streak#8889: i coulda slayed
 Streak#8889: dammit
 ByName#9795: I think we were the last year
 Streak#8889: damn we got robbed
 JamiesonH#0334: We used to
 ByName#9795: It did
 JamiesonH#0334: Model UN was so funny
 Streak#8889: does kegs do that?
 Streak#8889: no?
 Streak#8889: they should have just given us a small loan
 ByName#9795: Did you guys do model United Nations?
 ByName#9795: I wanted to do proper biznes
 Streak#8889: juicers
 JamiesonH#0334: That was kinda fun
 ByName#9795: Yh juice day
 JamiesonH#0334: Oh yeah
 JamiesonH#0334: Idk , can't remember what it is
 Streak#8889: we had to make different like juice flavours or something
 Streak#8889: did you not have it?
 Streak#8889: the most lost day
 JamiesonH#0334: What's enterprise day
 JamiesonH#0334: I had to waffle about how my game was fun for elite gamers because it has a high score board and they can compete for the best times
 Streak#8889: and spent the entire day on it
 Streak#8889: Yeah lol in our year 9 or 10 enterprise day he just brought it in
 JamiesonH#0334: Does he have a gaming laptop lmao
 Streak#8889: mr worrall with his cs:go laptop lmao
 JamiesonH#0334: Haven't done it yet lol
 Streak#8889: who was the elite
 JamiesonH#0334: My stakeholders were like casual gamer , non gamer and elite gamer lol
 Streak#8889: _the gamers_
 Streak#8889: what's your project btw ben idt i've asked
 JamiesonH#0334: Like end users of the program
 Streak#8889: what would that be like?
 Streak#8889: stakeholders?
 JamiesonH#0334: Which is easy for some things , but for a video game it sucks
 JamiesonH#0334: And do shit like explain what problem your program is a solution to
 ByName#9795: Interviewing my parents with the most leading questions possible
 ByName#9795: 'interview'
 JamiesonH#0334: You have to interview stakeholders in your program as well
 ByName#9795: I've already cut out half my iterations to save time
 ByName#9795: Like most of my code either works or doesn't work with no in between
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah but it's so long
 ByName#9795: And idk how I'm supposed to do testing with boundaries and all that, it's pretty clear cut
 Streak#8889: like an account of your development or something?
 JamiesonH#0334: Loads of shit
 Streak#8889: what do you have to write?
 JamiesonH#0334: Oh calmmm
 ByName#9795: Writing is so long
 ByName#9795: February 22 is final deadline
 JamiesonH#0334: I've done my program pretty much but the written part is fucked
 Streak#8889: Wtf i made a typo on the word 'g'
 Streak#8889: damn thats tough g
 JamiesonH#0334: I asked Logan and fen and they aired me
 JamiesonH#0334: Idk Ben
 ByName#9795: When is coursework deadline,im way behind I think
 ron0studios#4591: ah cool
 JamiesonH#0334: Ye
 Streak#8889: Uh oh jakes gonna pop off at that
 Taz#9211: I did that in y10 electronics lmao
 ron0studios#4591: like mantissa/exponent stuff?
 Streak#8889: dont do hacking kids
 JamiesonH#0334: Pretty much
 Streak#8889: or collab with another society
 Streak#8889: maybe on a gentler time we can do a compsoc on ethics tbf that's quite interesting with AI and all
 Taz#9211: what's boolean logic? just and or not xor etc
 JamiesonH#0334: The ethical stuff is more like the laws in Britain
 ron0studios#4591: boolean logic sounds fun?
 ron0studios#4591: oh ok
 JamiesonH#0334: We don't touch on that too much tbf
 JamiesonH#0334: We do Boolean logic and floating point binary which is the hardest stuff in the whole course imo
 ron0studios#4591: *aaaa*
 ron0studios#4591: oh no algorithmic bias
 Streak#8889: ooops?
 Streak#8889: so what if it destroys the world
 Streak#8889: whats an ethic we just build software
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah haha
 Streak#8889: Lmao do they leave it till last
 Streak#8889: cs best subject since they actually finish on time ez
 JamiesonH#0334: You also do the ethical stuff in year 13 which is a bit dead but it's piss easy tbf
 Streak#8889: y13's gonna be lost af
 Streak#8889: bro i already sit at the back and don't pay attention in his lessons
 JamiesonH#0334: And we are already done with the entire course , it's just revision now
 JamiesonH#0334: I just sit at the back and do cipher challenge stuff with Logan and fen or I do homework for other lessons
 Taz#9211: ah ic
 JamiesonH#0334: He basically lets you do whatever you want
 JamiesonH#0334: That's half , the othe half coursework lessons
 JamiesonH#0334: Coursework lessons with sims are so chill
 Taz#9211: what do u do in the lessons then? just theory on networks and shit
 Streak#8889: is this an advertisen't
 ron0studios#4591: coursework is fun ngl
 JamiesonH#0334: All the lessons are Sims and all the programming stuff is left to your coursework
 ron0studios#4591: __*j a v a*__
 ron0studios#4591: gonna have to use java
 ron0studios#4591: yikes
 Taz#9211: 😭
 JamiesonH#0334: So all his lessons on algorithms and data structures and stuff you just don't do
 JamiesonH#0334: Also shrey in year 13 you don't have any Johnson lessons
 JamiesonH#0334: Sick
 Streak#8889: Yeah
 JamiesonH#0334: Is that what his video animations are made with then
 Streak#8889: just be like square.transform(circle) et voila
 JamiesonH#0334: Sounds sick
 Streak#8889: which is pretty helpful
 Streak#8889: but it does all the fancy animations itself so you only really have to worry about what you want
 ron0studios#4591: dang
 Streak#8889: ManimCE is the community edition which has been made even easier
 ron0studios#4591: its alright
 ron0studios#4591: i saw a yt tutorial on it
 Streak#8889: Relatively
 JamiesonH#0334: Is it easy to use
 ron0studios#4591: FOSS time
 Streak#8889: Yeah
 Streak#8889: what a guy
 Streak#8889: Mf wrote it himself and released it to the world outta goodwill
 ron0studios#4591: yh its pretty good
 Taz#9211: it uses python right
 Streak#8889: Yeah
 JamiesonH#0334: Is that his animation engine
 Streak#8889: if i end up needing it
 Streak#8889: Maybe i'll use it for compsoc
 ron0studios#4591: ah i see
 Streak#8889: Yeah i tried out manim for a couple articles i wrote awhile back and its clean af
 JamiesonH#0334: Year 13 is just coursework and theory stuffv
 ron0studios#4591: yh
 ron0studios#4591: coursework?
 JamiesonH#0334: And his animations are nice
 Streak#8889: Bruh whats in the rest of the a level then
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah his videos are v good
 ron0studios#4591: yh 3b1b is epic
 JamiesonH#0334: The most complicated algs we do at a level is like quick sort and a* and you're already ahead of that probs
 Streak#8889: at visualising
 Streak#8889: Essence of Linear Algebra goes so hard man its actually godlike
 ron0studios#4591: nice
 Streak#8889: compsoc 4ever
 Streak#8889: exactly years are meaningless
 JamiesonH#0334: You are already doing stuff beyond the computer science a level spec tbf
 ron0studios#4591: how far will we be going with the course?
 Streak#8889: It's ez
 Streak#8889: You can do it
 Streak#8889: I did it in the yr 10-11 summer holidays
 ron0studios#4591: oh ok
 Streak#8889: Dw
 JamiesonH#0334: So you can probs handle it now
 JamiesonH#0334: You're gonna do it in a years time anyway
 ron0studios#4591: but im only in yr11
 ron0studios#4591: no i am
 JamiesonH#0334: For a level
 JamiesonH#0334: Are you doing further maths next year ?
 JamiesonH#0334: Why not
 ron0studios#4591: by looking at the messages
 ron0studios#4591: ite i don't think i'll be able to handle the maths
 JamiesonH#0334: At UCL and imperial comsci you do a lot of linear algebra
 JamiesonH#0334: Imma watch the 3blue1brown thing
 ByName#9795: Don't worry, imaginary numbers aren't real, they can't hurt you
 JamiesonH#0334: I'll need to learn them anyway eventually
 JamiesonH#0334: Fake news !
 JamiesonH#0334: Imaginary numbers ?!?! They aren't real so why do I need to know them
 JamiesonH#0334: Yes
 Streak#8889: quit before you go insane innit
 Streak#8889: correct thing to do
 JamiesonH#0334: I did like 4 chapters and then said okay time for a break and that break has been going on for 6 months now
 JamiesonH#0334: I just have the book
 JamiesonH#0334: I haven't acc done it lol
 Streak#8889: Big man Jamie
 Streak#8889: already got an expert here then
 Streak#8889: Yh that'd make sense
 JamiesonH#0334: I have book 1 further pure and I think I t has matrices
 Streak#8889: And no way they wait till uni that's shambolic if so
 Streak#8889: I think so cause we've got books 1 and 2 of pure a level maths and it's not in there
 Streak#8889: Hopefully I can explain them better lmao
 JamiesonH#0334: I swear it's in a level FM ? But I don't acc do it so idk
 ron0studios#4591: they don't do coordinate vectors
 ron0studios#4591: ah i see
 Streak#8889: They teach vectors but really badly and weirdly
 JamiesonH#0334: It's a level rudrrayan
 Streak#8889: It's not in the course for some reason
 ron0studios#4591: we've done a bit of vectors
 ron0studios#4591: at all
 ron0studios#4591: I do fsmq, but we haven't covered linear algebra yet
 Streak#8889: Yeah
 JamiesonH#0334: Do u do FM?
 Streak#8889: Compared to some of the weird shit in further maths lol
 Streak#8889: Tbh I feel like it's easy enough to do at like fsmq or something it's really not bad
 Streak#8889: Lmao
 JamiesonH#0334: Poor little year 10s can do a level further maths stuff early then lol
 Streak#8889: It's surprisingly little tbh
 Streak#8889: We'll roughly need vectors and matrices, and tensor products
 Streak#8889: Yeah
 JamiesonH#0334:   is linear algebra like matrices and vectors and such
 Streak#8889: Yep!
 JamiesonH#0334: Yes , you did a good job rudrrayan and crew !!
 ron0studios#4591:  are we immediately starting on quantum computing on the first week back?
 ron0studios#4591: thank you!
 ron0studios#4591: oh thats cool!
 JamiesonH#0334: did anyone else make submissions?
 JamiesonH#0334: well done caffeine heheee
 ByName#9795: Technology degree apprenticeship
 ByName#9795: Thank you! No idea what I actually have to do yet, so should be interesting
 Choopies#5687: gl
 ron0studios#4591: good luck!
 Karan.7519#8652: All the best
 ron0studios#4591: so is it an internship?
 Streak#8889: That's hype good luck Ben!
 Streak#8889: JP Morgan probs
 ron0studios#4591: who's JP?
 ByName#9795: I will not be there Wednesday first week back as I have a very fun looking assessment centre with JP all morning!
 ron0studios#4591: and gcse maths is really easy
 ron0studios#4591: I'll be there on wednesday first week back, bcs we have a gcse maths mock
 ron0studios#4591: hasnt been announced yet
 Choopies#5687: lol ill look into it sounds cool
 JamiesonH#0334: It's called malmo
 Choopies#5687: oh okay
 JamiesonH#0334: Yes
 Choopies#5687: like are there resources already given to make the agent move
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah basically
 Choopies#5687: would you import a library
 Choopies#5687: ohwait
 JamiesonH#0334: And then we would use deep q learning to train it
 JamiesonH#0334: The tool that lets you create minecraft bot agents and control it with a python file that sends it commands
 Choopies#5687: oh
 Choopies#5687: what would it even involve
 JamiesonH#0334: Bcos we couldn't get this thing to install called Malmö
 Choopies#5687: oh lol
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah but we didn't make much progress on it
 Choopies#5687: still sounds rlly cool
 JamiesonH#0334: Just the end
 Choopies#5687: thatd be really cool actually lol
 Choopies#5687: the whole speedrun or just the end
 ron0studios#4591: I'll make a yt video about it, maybe people may come around to contribute to the project!
 ron0studios#4591: idk it depends if I have the same team with me
 JamiesonH#0334: The ting go skraaaa
 JakeH#2364: so who won the ting i cba to read or has it not been announced?
 JamiesonH#0334: Or minecraft PvP hack detection
 JamiesonH#0334: Ender dragon killing ai
 Streak#8889: What was your idea gonna be again?
 JamiesonH#0334: I've finally freed myself of useless projects
 JamiesonH#0334: I would wanna develop me and Ben's idea but it's not really a good idea to take on any projects rn
 Streak#8889: Could take it in whatever direction you like
 Streak#8889: like outside of the Hackathon
 Streak#8889: adding features and all that
 Streak#8889: Yknow if you want you can keep developing it into like a high tier proper project
 ron0studios#4591: the 2nd number is the average fitness per generation
 ron0studios#4591: the first number is the highest fitness per generation
 ron0studios#4591: its pretty useful
 ron0studios#4591: oh yh just realized we left in some debug info in the terminal
 JamiesonH#0334: No lol
 ByName#9795: What did you show him!?
 JamiesonH#0334: You good ?
 ByName#9795: Minecraft clients!
 ron0studios#4591: 😰
 JamiesonH#0334: I can send you some pics of it if u like
 JamiesonH#0334: It means a boys hole
 JamiesonH#0334: Lmfao
 ron0studios#4591: i searched up boi cunny and got some random memes
 ron0studios#4591:   what does boi cunny luvr mean?
 JamiesonH#0334: Lol
 ron0studios#4591: exporting to windows,mac and linux together take up 1.5 gb
 JamiesonH#0334: So true !
 ron0studios#4591: ~~*(excluding export templates)*~~
 JamiesonH#0334: Sounds cool
 ron0studios#4591: and its only 70mb
 ron0studios#4591: bcs its language is pythonic, the editor is built in, and everything revolves around nodes
 ron0studios#4591: its really easy to make stuff quickly with it
 JamiesonH#0334: I've never used it
 JamiesonH#0334: You both so Godot then ?
 ron0studios#4591: it wouldn't have been nearly as interactive then
 JamiesonH#0334: Nice
 ron0studios#4591: The GUI was thanks to  though
 ron0studios#4591: tysm
 JamiesonH#0334: I'm just joking btw rudrrayan , ur thing is very impressive
 ron0studios#4591: thanks
 JamiesonH#0334: Ur vid is cool tho
 JamiesonH#0334: Real men find the solution by hand
 ron0studios#4591: ite
 JamiesonH#0334: Don't care ?!?
 Streak#8889: seems good
 Streak#8889: it searches for solutions with learning
 Streak#8889: Yeah Genetic Algorithms are more than valid - it does what an AI does
 ron0studios#4591: bruh it is a literal method to reinforcement learning
 JamiesonH#0334:  rey opinions
 ron0studios#4591: sec
 ron0studios#4591: one sc
 ron0studios#4591: its 16mb
 ron0studios#4591: onesec
 ron0studios#4591: yh
 ron0studios#4591: for us?
 JamiesonH#0334: Is there a video of it working
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah problem ?!?!!
 ron0studios#4591: but its really easy to get it running for linux bcs the godot engine is only 70mb
 ron0studios#4591: we got a windows release here
 ron0studios#4591: ite
 Streak#8889: Sure, go right ahead
 ron0studios#4591: who was in your team btw?
 JamiesonH#0334: Hackathon is harder when you have a social life 😪
 JamiesonH#0334: Ive had such a busy week
 ron0studios#4591: we got something working, but its pretty buggy, and the visuals are just boxes lmao
 ron0studios#4591: *oh*
 JamiesonH#0334: Also there's only two submissions bcos we didn't get anything done
 ron0studios#4591: keras is fun
 ron0studios#4591: oh cool
 JamiesonH#0334: Keras
 ron0studios#4591:  are we allowed to see each other's submissions now that the hackathon's over?
 JamiesonH#0334: Kera
 JamiesonH#0334: The tensorflow stuff
 ron0studios#4591: openai gym?
 ron0studios#4591: oh ok
 JamiesonH#0334: With libraries
 JamiesonH#0334: No lol
 ron0studios#4591: i mean from scratch?
 JamiesonH#0334: What lol
 ron0studios#4591: 💀
 ron0studios#4591: ah i see
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah
 ron0studios#4591: wasnt relevance to the theme a judging category?
 JamiesonH#0334: We tried to do deep q learning
 ron0studios#4591: oh yh
 JamiesonH#0334: It's up to shrey to decide haha
 ron0studios#4591: idk
 ron0studios#4591: i mean its an AI learning to do something so it counts?
 ron0studios#4591: the other 2 are very hard to implement
 ron0studios#4591: you got GA's, Q-learning and deep Q-learning
 ron0studios#4591: its a valid method of reinforcement learning tbf
 JamiesonH#0334: I suppose so
 ron0studios#4591: its a type of reinforcement learning
 JamiesonH#0334: Genetic algorithms aren't really AI tho are they?
 ron0studios#4591: and also a bit of game engine knowledge in the team helped a lot
 ron0studios#4591: they were super useful
 ron0studios#4591: I just copied off of shrey's genetic algorithm powerpoint
 JamiesonH#0334: Like I had to spend the first day researching everything we needed
 JamiesonH#0334: Also doing a creative ai in 4 days is no mean feat
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah
 ron0studios#4591: idek
 ron0studios#4591: maybe a 2 week one next time?
 ron0studios#4591: bit annoying
 ron0studios#4591: yh we had to revise for mocks too
 JamiesonH#0334: Too much coursework
 JamiesonH#0334: Wish I had more time , didn't have enough to get anything done
 ron0studios#4591: got a bit stressful for us on the last day 😅
 ron0studios#4591: how'd everyone find kegshack btw?
 Streak#8889: Happy new year!
 ron0studios#4591: Happy new year everyone!
 Karan.7519#8652: I can only imagine the pain
 Karan.7519#8652: F
 Choopies#5687: ai ai ai i think i finished it aswell
 Choopies#5687: ffs just spent 20 minutes doing this python challenge then refreshed the page and everything got deleted
 Choopies#5687: k
 JamiesonH#0334: Teams
 Choopies#5687: on the github or teams
 Choopies#5687: wait what lol
 JamiesonH#0334: We did a lua challenge and no one did it
 Choopies#5687: No I'm joking but will it be back anytime
 ByName#9795: For what reason
 Choopies#5687: i want to speak to your manager
 Choopies#5687: who runs coding club
 JamiesonH#0334: 😳😳
 Taz#9211: u can enlighten the y7s on the wonders of programming and boi cunny
 JamiesonH#0334: I'll come back in as a guest speaker
 Streak#8889: clown on these school kids
 Streak#8889: just stay in the server after you go uni
 JamiesonH#0334: Even worse
 JamiesonH#0334: That's a level revision term lol
 Streak#8889: dang itd be crazy if it was on next term ahaha
 JamiesonH#0334: Ive stayed up to 2am every night of it doing my NEA
 JamiesonH#0334: Wish I could do Hackathon again when I had more time lol
 Choopies#5687: crab game
 ron0studios#4591: ite
 Taz#9211: just 3 cause im not making anything
 ron0studios#4591: Are there 4 teams still btw?
 ron0studios#4591: We're always asking "What kegshack project are you doing?", but we never ask "How is your kegshack project feeling?"
 Streak#8889: turn up at bill gates' house asking him to fix it
 Streak#8889: try emailing the project maintainers themselves idk lol
 Streak#8889: god has truly forsaken you
 ByName#9795: Not exactly a lot of free time, so unnecessary bugs are annoying
 Coloursplash#9680: It’s always “how is KegsHACK going?” but they never ask “how are you doing?”
 Coloursplash#9680: imagine having free time during the holidays 🙄
 ByName#9795: The errors are now at the point that Google finds nothing and GitHub issues answers don't work
 JamiesonH#0334: hows yours going
 JamiesonH#0334: also its going pretty badly ngl
 JamiesonH#0334: nah
 ron0studios#4591: i thought you'd use java or smth
 ron0studios#4591: woah
 JamiesonH#0334: it keeps crashing ;-;
 ByName#9795: Building wheels!
 ByName#9795: Pip is very fun
 JamiesonH#0334: We are doing a bot to beat the ender dragon
 JamiesonH#0334: Wdym car evolution ?
 ron0studios#4591: What about you guys?
 ron0studios#4591: Car evolution
 JamiesonH#0334: What is your team making ?
 JamiesonH#0334: Having trouble with pip installing lol
 JamiesonH#0334: Not amazing
 ron0studios#4591: with kegshack I mean
 ron0studios#4591: How's everyone doing?
 Choopies#5687:
 ron0studios#4591:
 Fulankf#5671:
 JamiesonH#0334:
 Fulankf#5671:
 Taz#9211: I would've given it 10/10
 Taz#9211: should've had that idea a few days ago
 JamiesonH#0334: Me and Ben are making an r34 art generator ai
 Simran#0812: Oooh
 Professor Chaos#9143: I'm pretty sure you just had to embed some javascipt into the URL.
 Taz#9211: yeah idk how you'd have it change the code automatically
 JamiesonH#0334: I was just tryna find a way of changing the least amount of code
 JamiesonH#0334: And I followed their process through all the steps so I know what to change I think
 JamiesonH#0334: Bcos I found all the code for it
 JamiesonH#0334: It's on the client I'm pretty sure
 Taz#9211: but if answer checking is on the client then it's 100% possible to cheat in some way
 Taz#9211: probs just made it a little bit secure
 Taz#9211: there probably still is a way to hack mymaths cause I doubt they moved all of the answer checking to the server
 JamiesonH#0334: So you think I could have sold a my maths hack
 Streak#8889: 🤑
 JamiesonH#0334: Bcos i found the function that like scores your answers
 JamiesonH#0334: I read like 100s of lines of the my maths code and I'm pretty sure I could figure out a cheat if I put more time into it
 JamiesonH#0334: Haha maybe
 Streak#8889: i remember that
 Streak#8889: wasn't in the kegs ragmag some year lmao
 JamiesonH#0334: Bcos there used to be an easy cheat but then they fixed it
 JamiesonH#0334: I used to sweat trying to hack my maths tbf
 Streak#8889: i dont wanna do this
 Streak#8889: ayo bonus points in kegshack if you make an ai that does mymaths for me
 Choopies#5687:
 ron0studios#4591: what does that mean
 JamiesonH#0334: 🐶👍
 ron0studios#4591: I woke up at 10:15 lol
 JamiesonH#0334: IM READY
 ron0studios#4591: lmao yeah
 Streak#8889: literally us in prizegiving
 ron0studios#4591: *"sorry guys, I have something really important to go to"*
*"wait wha-"*
*"I'll be 30 minutes tops!"*
 ByName#9795: Just leave the exam early
 JamiesonH#0334: Who cares mocks are cringe
 ron0studios#4591: *mocks*
 ron0studios#4591: because
 ron0studios#4591: I don't think anyone in year 11 will be able to come in on the first week of Computing society
 ron0studios#4591: hello
 Arsenal2003_04#2797:
 ron0studios#4591: there might be more
 ron0studios#4591: i think there are 4
 ByName#9795: How many teams are there now?
 ron0studios#4591: hi
 Yaseen#1185:

 ron0studios#4591: bye
 ron0studios#4591: anyways I gtg
 ron0studios#4591: "copium nah bro"
 ron0studios#4591: (._.)
 Streak#8889: Copium
 ron0studios#4591: and it was supposed to annoy ppl with
 ron0studios#4591: bruh that was one video
 ron0studios#4591: gigachad jamey
 JamiesonH#0334: as opposed to me
 JamiesonH#0334: seeing a lot of nerds in here
 ron0studios#4591: did not know it was public
 ron0studios#4591: its privated
 ron0studios#4591: and now
 ron0studios#4591: its just a bunch of random videos I have
 ron0studios#4591: oh right
 Professor Chaos#9143: Look carefully at the URL you sent
 ron0studios#4591: the AUR is a godsend
 Professor Chaos#9143: Imagine using pacman to install stuff
 ron0studios#4591: playlist?
 Professor Chaos#9143: That actually explains alot
 Streak#8889: he uses arch linux i think the furry playlist is explained well enough
 ron0studios#4591: endeavouros
 Professor Chaos#9143: Should have used Ubuntu
 ron0studios#4591: its not pure arch tbf
 Professor Chaos#9143: Still doesn't explain the playlist
 ron0studios#4591: arch has helped it run so much faster
 ron0studios#4591: my laptop is old and painfully slow
 Professor Chaos#9143: Shrey likes his carbs and computer science too
 ron0studios#4591: and keyboards
 ron0studios#4591: I like ricing
 Streak#8889: care to explain
 Streak#8889: rudrrayan
 Streak#8889: wait yeah that's a very good point nigel
 Professor Chaos#9143: Is that saved to a playlist?
 Professor Chaos#9143: Ahhhhhhh. You are not normal.
 Streak#8889: Oh god the pain
 ron0studios#4591: as in the uwu one?
 Professor Chaos#9143: Debian?
 Professor Chaos#9143: I haven't seen that and I don't think I want to.
 ron0studios#4591: yh
 Professor Chaos#9143: New shortcut key
 Streak#8889: at least it's not the furry version
 Streak#8889: well
 ron0studios#4591: its very funny
 ron0studios#4591: i have this copypasta practically hotkeyed at this point
 Professor Chaos#9143: I strongly object to that
 ron0studios#4591: I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.
Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called "Linux", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.
There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called "Linux" distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.
 Professor Chaos#9143: Are you a linux man?
 ron0studios#4591: nice
 Professor Chaos#9143: Raspberry Pi OS
 ron0studios#4591: what operating system do you use  ?
 ron0studios#4591: hehe
 Professor Chaos#9143: I only use it for Social Engineering
 ron0studios#4591: tbf I use gmail a lot bcs its linked to my google account
 Professor Chaos#9143: Or gmail when I am feeling less dubious
 ron0studios#4591: i have a protonmail account too
 ron0studios#4591: superior proton mail
 Professor Chaos#9143: protonmail
 JamiesonH#0334: what email do u use
 JamiesonH#0334: you are haters
 ron0studios#4591: @hotmail.cn
 Professor Chaos#9143: Probably something .outlook.com
 ron0studios#4591: t
 ron0studios#4591: you'd have to tell us where your address is firs
 Professor Chaos#9143: After all, its only chump change
 JamiesonH#0334: just drop it off at my house
 Professor Chaos#9143: You are not signed up
 JamiesonH#0334: tip me some money why dont you
 JamiesonH#0334: so true

 Streak#8889: gosh that would be embarassing if you sent it to me
 ByName#9795: Oh Bat - don't you need ID to do anything with that
 JamiesonH#0334: i have so much crypto its a joke
 Streak#8889: all your crypto earnings i'd have to have it

 Streak#8889: ah sorry wrong indian kid my bad
 JamiesonH#0334: you are bozos
 Streak#8889: huhuhu
 JamiesonH#0334: NO YOU DO NOT
 Taz#9211: hehehehaha
 Taz#9211: i own it now
 JamiesonH#0334: @everyone
 JamiesonH#0334: And this goes for anyone who thinks they can fuck with my fucking nft
 JamiesonH#0334: I want to have a word with you
 JamiesonH#0334: Rudrrayan come VC
 Karan.7519#8652: That brought back some memories
 ByName#9795: You wouldn't steal a Car.
You wouldn't steal a Handbag.
You wouldn't steal a Mobile Phone.
You wouldn't steal a NFT.
NFT Piracy is Stealing.
Stealing is Against the Law.
Piracy. It's A Crime.
 Leavinq#1285: Ruddrayan get your legal affairs in order, cncm.co.uk has ful legal ownership of that image
 JamiesonH#0334: You come for my nft and I'll be furious
 JamiesonH#0334: I don't find this funny rudrrayan
 ron0studios#4591: I live walking distance from my local police department. If another person uses my NFT without my consent I will report them immediately. This is MY PROPERTY. The transaction has be verified scientifically on the block chain. Anyone who violates my NFT rights will pay the price
Buddy, you have no idea who you are messing with. I have made a ridiculous amount of money in crypto/NFTs and I have the best lawyers. If you don’t remove my NFT as your profile picture you’re going to regret it. When you steal someone’s property you get punished. Watch out.
 ron0studios#4591: You think it's funny to take screenshots of people's NFTS, huh? Property theft is a joke to you? l'll have you know that the blockchain doesn't lie. I own it. Even if you save it, it's my property. You are mad that you don't own the art that I own. Delete that screenshot.
 ron0studios#4591: found some pretty neat copypastas for nft screenshots
 ron0studios#4591: its my brand name
 ron0studios#4591: CNCM is an encrypted message that translates to rudrrayan
 JamiesonH#0334: Who do you think you are ay
 JamiesonH#0334: It says owned by me
 JamiesonH#0334: Have you not heard of blockhain
 JamiesonH#0334: Acctually it's NON FUNGIBLE you blithering idekiot
 JamiesonH#0334: Unless if you wanna buy it then it's a very important and promising investment !!!
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah I have one up for sale lol but it's just a joke not rly serious about it
 ron0studios#4591:  are you selling NFTs?
 JamiesonH#0334: Come on
 Leavinq#1285: Time Is Running Out.
 JamiesonH#0334: Hurry up
 JamiesonH#0334:  cncm.co.uk now
 Leavinq#1285:
 JamiesonH#0334:
 MasterReacher14#5404:
 Leavinq#1285: litearlly the whole time they have only done weird combos or made their own cipher and they just decide this time to fuck around iwth an existing cipher
 JamiesonH#0334: I'm gonna be salty about this for the rest of my life ngl
 JamiesonH#0334: That was so much better
 JamiesonH#0334: Why couldn't they have done something like last year smh
 JamiesonH#0334: Stupid fucker smh
 Leavinq#1285: this fucking jokester harry :)))
 Leavinq#1285: Maybe it was too big an assumption – there are lots of pairs XY with both elements coming from the bottom row. Unless this is a very unusual text there are far too many to get from digits in the plaintext, but that makes me think. Maybe this is not quite the standard Playfair cipher? Maybe, the pair shift rules are different from the usual ones? The question is, what are they?
A pair XY where both are in the same row -> ?
A pair XY where both are in the same column -> ?
 JamiesonH#0334: For Hackathon I'm gonna make an AI that can solve any cipher
 JamiesonH#0334: Kazinsky pilled
 JamiesonH#0334: Based
 Leavinq#1285: goig to mail a pipe bomb to harrys house :))
 JamiesonH#0334: I'm gonna find out where harry lives
 Leavinq#1285: it
 Leavinq#1285: do
 JamiesonH#0334: I'm going to go crazy
 JamiesonH#0334: I despise kcs
 JamiesonH#0334: Why
 Streak#8889: once youre famous
 Streak#8889: as long as you shoutout kegs compsoc
 JamiesonH#0334: After uni we will make it the greatest computing project of all time
 JamiesonH#0334: Bingus theme
 JamiesonH#0334: CNCM will grow to eclipse the cipher challenge
 Streak#8889: is there a recommended colour scheme
 Leavinq#1285: tru
 JamiesonH#0334: cncm.co.uk or you're a homophobe
 Streak#8889: here comes the plug
 JamiesonH#0334: Only solace is our sexy website
 JamiesonH#0334: All wasted
 JamiesonH#0334: I put so many hours into it lol
 Leavinq#1285: hes a different breed of human
 Streak#8889: wonder how mr johnson figured that out
 Leavinq#1285: its meant to be an x for doubles not a 0
 Leavinq#1285: and to think the whole time we were pretty much there and only didnt get it cause they did non stardard shit
 JamiesonH#0334: Fr
 Streak#8889: when the drunk guy starts coding you know hes serious
 JamiesonH#0334: Stupid shit
 JamiesonH#0334: I was genuinely heartbroken after 10b
 JamiesonH#0334: There was people on the dcode discord asking people who didn't know about the cipher challenge to do it for them
 JamiesonH#0334: Like on the Thursday or Friday?
 JamiesonH#0334: To Reddit
 Streak#8889: well thats fun to know
 Streak#8889: but if you guessed it you gotta try smh
 JamiesonH#0334: When was it first uploaded
 Streak#8889: They should do it again but with a different key so if you got the solution to the first one you can just reuse it
 LoaTer#0001: It got taken down the day after lol
 Streak#8889: redo?? we have to go through that again????
 Leavinq#1285: would be mega pog
 Leavinq#1285: hoping and praying they know it was leaked and redo week 10b
 Streak#8889: so happy for you honestly
 JamiesonH#0334: We are number 1 sorry shrey
 Leavinq#1285: cipher master is offline :(
 Streak#8889: yeah so basically theres this team called thecypher you might notice we're in 2nd rn come join us ez
 Leavinq#1285: L
 Streak#8889: and mr johnson did some cool bigram analysis thing
 LoaTer#0001: Anyway gotta pick a better team next year
 LoaTer#0001: 6x6
 JamiesonH#0334: They just did a stupid twist on top of it
 Streak#8889: my guy  made the playfair connection
 LoaTer#0001: Cause it was 36 characters
 JamiesonH#0334: We knew it was a 6x6 playfair tbf
 Streak#8889: smart
 LoaTer#0001: I recognised the cipher
 LoaTer#0001: 6x6 playfair cipher
 Streak#8889: when did you get it?
 Streak#8889: 10b wtf
 LoaTer#0001: Then i found 10b on reddit
 Streak#8889: all the way to 10a was calm
 JamiesonH#0334: Tony then*
 Streak#8889: Story of my fucking life mate
 LoaTer#0001: I am tony noy simon
 LoaTer#0001: Got all the way to 10a
 JamiesonH#0334: Simon do you go to Mr Johnsons cipher club
 LoaTer#0001: || it was basically me||
 Streak#8889: oh were you in a team?
 LoaTer#0001: My team were useless lol
 JamiesonH#0334: Fr
 Leavinq#1285: literally had revolutionary algorithms for subtitution solving and it was for nothing
 JamiesonH#0334: cncm.co.uk btw
 JamiesonH#0334: I went insane coding our website
 JamiesonH#0334: Bruh you have no idea
 Streak#8889: man carried us
 Streak#8889: well Henry's blood sweat and tears
 Streak#8889: blood sweat and tears in that
 Streak#8889: mf i'm salty too now wtf
 JamiesonH#0334: I was thinking the same
 LoaTer#0001: Lol
 JamiesonH#0334: Lmao shrey
 JamiesonH#0334: These year 8s who accidentally solved it on cipher tools 😴
 Streak#8889: the year 8s were messing around on a website my ass
 LoaTer#0001: The friday
 LoaTer#0001: I found it on day after it was posted
 Leavinq#1285: take the piss
 Streak#8889: come again
 LoaTer#0001: Exactly
 Streak#8889: It was what
 JamiesonH#0334: Lmao
 LoaTer#0001: It was leaked on reddit for 1 dat
 Streak#8889: we're in a different team to jamey, got it monday
 Streak#8889: yeah 10B hit hard
 LoaTer#0001: Big oof
 Streak#8889: >was
 JamiesonH#0334: And we got fucked by week 10
 JamiesonH#0334: My team was first overall and Shreys team was second in the country
 Streak#8889: lmao
 Streak#8889: he's salty
 LoaTer#0001: Ok
 JamiesonH#0334: That's banned from being mentioned sorry
 JamiesonH#0334: Yes
 LoaTer#0001: Coded in lua?
 LoaTer#0001: Yep
 JamiesonH#0334: Did you enjoy the video
 JamiesonH#0334: 🥺
 LoaTer#0001: Im not signed in and i cba to sign in
 Streak#8889: Up to you guys idk who invited everyone lmao
 Streak#8889: the kegshack thing's in  if you're interested ig
 JamiesonH#0334: You should like my YouTube video
 LoaTer#0001: No
 Streak#8889: er ok then ig
 LoaTer#0001: So i joined anyway
 LoaTer#0001: Idk  told me to join
 Streak#8889: Are you here for KegsHACK?
 Streak#8889: hi tony
 Streak#8889: mans already on his video plugs
Like and subscribe this video
 JamiesonH#0334: Ayyy tonyyyyyy
 LoaTer#0001: Idk whos here
 LoaTer#0001: (Y10)
 LoaTer#0001: I am tony btw
 LoaTer#0001: Hi
 LoaTer#0001:
 JamiesonH#0334: Lol what
 Choopies#5687: he think its just hacking and i cba to tell him otherwise
 Choopies#5687: lol he doesnt want to do it
 ron0studios#4591: this is going to get confusing
 AreSeven#9812:
 Choopies#5687: arnavvvv
 Choopies#5687: lol
 Choopies#5687: yes
 Streak#8889: speed leave
 Streak#8889: lol did brother rehan leave immediately
 Choopies#5687: oh i gtg for a few hours
 Choopies#5687: go announcement
 Choopies#5687: do u want to join my team
 Choopies#5687: arnie
 ARNAV#2335:
 Brother Rehan#2904:
 Streak#8889: since its suggestions get done before they're even made
 Streak#8889: technically that means  has more than a 100% success rate
 Streak#8889: Lmao
 ron0studios#4591: I just said lol for no reason lol
 Streak#8889: we'll personally hunt him down if he does \:)
 Streak#8889: Taran's sworn he wont cheat dw
 ron0studios#4591: ok cool
 Streak#8889: Yeah
 ron0studios#4591: im assuming taran and karan already knows the theme?
 Streak#8889: we'll be online if you need us as well
 Streak#8889: I'll post it in 
 ron0studios#4591: the voice chat?
 ron0studios#4591: will you be on a discord call?
 Streak#8889: 10AM
 ron0studios#4591: what time exactly on monday will you reveal it?
 Streak#8889: dont want yall becoming code monkeys
 Streak#8889: There'll be a couple example ideas in the Monday project brief, but originality and creativity is important as well - so if you've got your own ideas, or something you'd like to do, I'd highlyyyy recommend that
 ron0studios#4591: anything artificial intelligence
 ron0studios#4591: you'll find out the theme by monday i think
 JamiesonH#0334: gather them up quickly boy !!!!
 Choopies#5687: i have some friends that code too
 Choopies#5687: wait shrey could i join using python but you give me an idea for something
 Choopies#5687: other than that im not too sure
 Choopies#5687: i mean you can do like ai pathfinding
 Choopies#5687: yeah thats fine
 Streak#8889: how would roblox studio make an ai
 Choopies#5687: loll
 Streak#8889: dont use like wix
 Streak#8889: so like
 Streak#8889: we'll want like code and all though
 Streak#8889: idek what roblox studio is
 Choopies#5687: pigeonblox incoming
 JamiesonH#0334: king
 Choopies#5687: waitt can u use roblox studio
 Choopies#5687: itd be fun to make something in python but im not too good
 Streak#8889: we'll release that + the project brief, clarification on submissions and all that on Monday
 Choopies#5687: hmm
 Streak#8889: Yeah you can use any language, framework, whatever you like
 Choopies#5687: anything?
 Choopies#5687: bruh ill join but what can u make it in
 ByName#9795: What are the judging criteria
 ByName#9795: 30Hz Zuckerberg diss track style
 JamiesonH#0334: It takes quite a lot of learning to make even something basic tbf
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah fair enough
 ron0studios#4591: i just followed a udemy course last year and gave up bcs I couldn't make anything practical lol
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah
 ron0studios#4591: thats still something
 JamiesonH#0334: That's all I've done
 JamiesonH#0334: I made a cryptocurrency trading ai that was really shit and unfinished
 JamiesonH#0334: Sick
 ron0studios#4591: to meet his family i think
 ron0studios#4591: yh
 JamiesonH#0334: Lol on holiday?
 ron0studios#4591: but he's currently in the US
 ron0studios#4591: he's had some experience with AI
 ron0studios#4591: we have 1 person who's probably carrying us a bit lol
 JamiesonH#0334: Acc idk about Ben, that's just me
 JamiesonH#0334: Me and Ben both have a little , but not that much
 JamiesonH#0334: How much experience do you lot have with ai
 JamiesonH#0334: Nice nice
 Coloursplash#9680: 3, including rudrrayan
 JamiesonH#0334: Rudrrayan how many people are in your team
 Streak#8889: ..perhaps yes
 JamiesonH#0334: So there's basically 3 teams ?
 Streak#8889: godlike coder and all
 Streak#8889: also taran might be a special team
 ron0studios#4591: ite
 Streak#8889: anything else is secondary
 Streak#8889: the project part is the main bit
 Streak#8889: I mean
 Streak#8889: more than 1
 ron0studios#4591: bcs 2 seems like a bit too little
 ron0studios#4591: what would you say is the minimum amount of teams to make the contest enjoyable?
 JamiesonH#0334: Me and Ben are making an AI that writes a disstrack on our rival group
 JamiesonH#0334: No one is grinding , take advantage of that
 JamiesonH#0334: Christmas is the most important day of the year
 Streak#8889: wanna take a wild guess?
 ron0studios#4591: who is the other team btw?
 ron0studios#4591: fair enough lol
 Streak#8889: 🎉
 Streak#8889: and so we don't have to be pinging and making channels and all that on christmas day
 Streak#8889: so we know who's actually gonna be in it
 ron0studios#4591: why is today the last day to sign up?
 JamiesonH#0334: Join up guys 🥺
 Karan.7519#8652: We now have 2 teams
 Streak#8889: and maybe that wont be true
 Streak#8889: 10 minutes
 Streak#8889: wait like
 JamiesonH#0334: You have like 1 team tho
 Streak#8889: quality > quantity imo innit
 Taz#9211: are there? that's pretty sick
 Streak#8889: we'll be full of year 8s and 9s and nobody wants that
 Streak#8889: nah don't let them be aware of compsoc
 ron0studios#4591: there are a lot of sweaty python users in year 8-9 atm
 ron0studios#4591: we should send the email to year 7-9's aswell
 JamiesonH#0334: Join Hackathon you Muppets
 ron0studios#4591: nice
 Leavinq#1285: ctl 472
 ron0studios#4591: what tablet do you use for osu? 👀
 Leavinq#1285: sorry jamey I have to play osu instead 😔
 JamiesonH#0334: Sign up for kegs Hackathon or you're a neek
 Suf#8586: u too
 Streak#8889: nice to meet you
 Choopies#5687: ____
 Suf#8586: sufyaan im in year 10
 Choopies#5687: he is
 Suf#8586: hi ty
 Choopies#5687: i inv him
 Streak#8889: who is u?
 Choopies#5687:
 Streak#8889: hi
 Suf#8586:
 Streak#8889: sorry g
 JamiesonH#0334: That just makes my job even worse lol
 JamiesonH#0334: 😭
 Streak#8889: Henry's just cracked idk
 Streak#8889: Like it was jumbled we didn't even have all the numbers next to each other in order
 JamiesonH#0334: Did you have the LM0123456789 in there tho
 Streak#8889: Somehow it still worked but even our bottom row was different
 JamiesonH#0334: Lol what
 Streak#8889: we ended up with a different version of the key 💀💀💀
 JamiesonH#0334: Inshallah tell me Henry 😈
 JamiesonH#0334: Is the bit of the key that's covered LM0123
 JamiesonH#0334: I'm actually somewhat of an AI myself 👀👀
 Leavinq#1285: well known fact ‼️
 JamiesonH#0334: The method to solve it last year was much ingenuous
 JamiesonH#0334: And from there it's not too bad to solve genetically which is kinda boring imo
 JamiesonH#0334: As opposed to this the whole challenge was figuring out what cipher it was
 JamiesonH#0334: It was fun bcos you spent your time understanding how it worked and then making your own solution
 JamiesonH#0334: Add there own cipher and told you what it was
 Taz#9211: what did they do last year
 JamiesonH#0334: Who tryna team up 😪 I'm the AI goat , this is very well known
 JamiesonH#0334: Hackathon more important
 JamiesonH#0334: We take being first after 9 rounds lol
 JamiesonH#0334: But nvm
 JamiesonH#0334: I wish they did something like last year instead of just doing a cipher we already knew but adding a stupid twist to it
 Streak#8889: based opinion
 JamiesonH#0334: Me and Logan decided that the cipher challenge is cringe and stupid past night
 JamiesonH#0334: The clue narrows it down so much since it gives you a third of the key
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah none of my genetic stuff was working without the clue
 henindapen#2396: i dont think it ever would have finished if not for the clue though
 Streak#8889: Lmao
 JamiesonH#0334: Fens been missing and Logan is too angry lol
 Streak#8889: or personally find logan and fenwick to do it
 JamiesonH#0334: I'll be home soon hopefully
 Streak#8889: go get em buster
 JamiesonH#0334: As soon as I get home I should be able to do it fairly quickly
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah
 henindapen#2396: it looked at ngrams or something, idk i found it in my files from like years ago
 Streak#8889: Idk
 Streak#8889: ..?
 Streak#8889: er
 JamiesonH#0334: What scoring function did you use
 Streak#8889: he's incredibly incredibly cracked
 JamiesonH#0334: My drunk coding was an epic fail lol
 Streak#8889: well dones to  he solved it
 JamiesonH#0334: I haven't been able to work on it since Friday ;-;
 JamiesonH#0334: Well done !!!
 Streak#8889:   
so it turns out genetic algorithms are the way 
 JamiesonH#0334: It was a transposition cipher all along 🤯
 ByName#9795: I mean I'm technically set up for doing AI but haven't touched it in almost over a year
 JamiesonH#0334: Who tryna team up 🤥
 JamiesonH#0334: Who's doing it then
 Taz#9211: yeah teams are fine
 JamiesonH#0334: Is it teams?
 JamiesonH#0334: Sick!
 Taz#9211: so the final detail will only be revealed right before it begins
 Taz#9211: nah the point is that you have a limited time to make smth
 JamiesonH#0334: Do we have any details other then its an AI yet?
 Taz#9211: yeah it'll be fun to see what people make
 JamiesonH#0334: Good idea shreu!
 JamiesonH#0334: I'm hypeddd for Hackathon tho
 JamiesonH#0334: Me and Logan are enjoying the party by being depressed about cipjer challenge
 JamiesonH#0334: Fax
 Taz#9211: jamie mate you're off the gloop
 JamiesonH#0334: This is why I get off to my code !!!
 Streak#8889: can't even code sober wtf is this
 JamiesonH#0334: So true!!!
 Streak#8889: ez code
 Streak#8889: just map everything to 0 then reduce the text to 75 characters
 JamiesonH#0334: Need me a key with 75 zeros fr 🥵🥵🤒🥴🥴
 notFenwick#4649: so sad
 notFenwick#4649: nerds
 ByName#9795: Every time you get an error, take a shot
 ByName#9795: Drunk coding!
 JamiesonH#0334: Not going well
 JamiesonH#0334: I'm really drunk tryna do it lol
 ByName#9795: So the laptops probably just decided it doesn't like chrome
 Taz#9211: yeah it does
 ByName#9795: Oh ye electron - does that use chromium?
 Coloursplash#9680: yes
 Streak#8889: and they made the web version
 Streak#8889: it's on Electron right
 ByName#9795: Doesn't vscode use some chromium thing because it's based on react or similar?
 JamiesonH#0334: I cba lol
 ByName#9795: And download web pages using the console
 ByName#9795: Use wget
 ByName#9795: Don't use chrome
 Taz#9211: 💀
 JamiesonH#0334: Now it just won't open chrome or Vs code
 JamiesonH#0334: And it was slow but working fine
 JamiesonH#0334: It was running chrome earlier
 Streak#8889: oldest laptop in history
 Streak#8889: bros breaking cipher challenge on an abacus
 ByName#9795: How old is the laptop that it can't run a web browser?
 JamiesonH#0334: Yep!!!
 ByName#9795: Code breaking party!
 JamiesonH#0334: Alex is bringing his laptop tonight anyway
 JamiesonH#0334: I mean if you have to use a browser to install it you can't use it
 ByName#9795: If you can run any sort of remote access viewer about half my computers can be run headlessly
 ron0studios#4591: could you do it on a phone?
 ByName#9795: It's that bad?
 JamiesonH#0334: No lol
 ByName#9795: Do you have a laptop capable of running team viewer?
 JamiesonH#0334: Not much
 ByName#9795: How much processing power does it need to solve it?
 ron0studios#4591: well good luck!
 ron0studios#4591: yikes
 JamiesonH#0334: I literally have all the code to do it , just that it's on my gfs laptop which crashes everytime you open chrome and won't open Vs code
 JamiesonH#0334: I'm having a party later and I wanna ask someone to bring a laptop so I can run it
 JamiesonH#0334: I know what it is now but I don't have a laptop capable of solving it
 JamiesonH#0334: We had figured out it was a 6x6 playfair with some sort of twist on Thursday but just couldn't figure out the twist
 JamiesonH#0334: It's a 6x6 playfair rudrrayan
 ron0studios#4591: how tf is there 0 "zz"s??
 ron0studios#4591: what are your guys' ideas? Is it just a substitution then, but with numbers?
 ron0studios#4591: they solved 9B in half an hour by just spamming ciphertools among themselves
 ron0studios#4591: pretty much lmao
 Streak#8889: bro wtf is year 8 just a buncha monkeys with typewriters or smth
 ron0studios#4591: are these the same yr 8's that solved 9B by guessing as well?
 Streak#8889: Ah yeah that's a v good point
 JamiesonH#0334: Like ABB wouldn't count but AAB would
 JamiesonH#0334: Also wouldn't there be expected 75 0s bcos you only put in a 0 if the double char appears on the right bit
 JamiesonH#0334: I'm pissed how dfuck did they get it
 Streak#8889: how did they get the 1 in 36! chance
 Streak#8889: hoes mad at the year 8s but we move 👀
 Streak#8889: calm
 JamiesonH#0334: That's smart
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah I'll do it like that when I get my hands on my laptop
 Streak#8889: and then if it still doesn't have an exact solution, aiming at around 150 of them
 Streak#8889: if the genetic algorithm targets getting rid of all numbers except zero
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah
 JamiesonH#0334: Oh ywhq
 Streak#8889: sooo there should be about 150 0s in the plaintext
 Streak#8889: and each double letter means a 0 is added
 Streak#8889: According to this, about 3% of the time you get a double letter http://homepages.math.uic.edu/~leon/mcs425-s08/handouts/doublechar_freq.pdf
 Streak#8889: What was the key you guys got to with just 60ish numbers left in the text?
 ByName#9795: Is there a way of making it multithreaded?
 JamiesonH#0334: Genetic alg
 ByName#9795: Are you trying to brute force it?
 JamiesonH#0334: Just did that oof
 JamiesonH#0334: Guys don't run a 500000 generation algorithm on a 2010 laptop!
 JamiesonH#0334: I know how to do it but Im at GFs and don't have laptop noooo
 Simran#0812: Oh ok
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah
 Simran#0812: Do u need to tell your process in order to win the prize?
 Simran#0812: Whoops
 Simran#0812: Oh
 JamiesonH#0334: So they won't win any prizes
 JamiesonH#0334: Apparently they accidentally stumbled upon it when messing about on ciphertools
 Simran#0812: Other than brute forcing?
 Simran#0812: Is there a way to guess the key
 Simran#0812: How did they do it so quickly?
 Simran#0812: Takes too long
 Simran#0812: Ive been trying brute forcing
 Simran#0812: Really?!
 Simran#0812: Omg
 JamiesonH#0334: Bruh
 henindapen#2396: 😭
 Streak#8889: Some year 8s beat us to it
 Streak#8889: what the fuck
 Streak#8889: busy days
 JamiesonH#0334: I'm bday shopping
 Streak#8889: Mums 50th today tho so I'm not gonna be able to work on it
 Streak#8889: Like the enigma esque one
 Streak#8889: Still thinking about the cribbing thing Johnson was saying
 JamiesonH#0334: I'll take this as a no?
 JamiesonH#0334: I'm still pretty lost as to what we should be doing
 JamiesonH#0334: Anyone made any progress ?
 Streak#8889: impossible
 Streak#8889: yeah finding the key is like
 Leavinq#1285: Johnson has pretty kuch confirmed playfair but got nowhere with it
 JamiesonH#0334: or its not playfair
 JamiesonH#0334: so idk if the code was bad
 JamiesonH#0334: none of my simulated annealing worked n
 Streak#8889: man
 Streak#8889: but idk
 Streak#8889: like i won't be available till sunday
 Streak#8889: guaranteed we're not getting anywhere high cause we won't be able to do it for ages
 Streak#8889: thing is if I go to sleep today then that's giving up
 Streak#8889: jeez
 Streak#8889: that is scary yeah
 Streak#8889: all that's left is merging and collapsing, and the latter's easy once the former's done
 JamiesonH#0334: the thing that scares me is we still have no real confirmation that its plafair cipher
 Streak#8889: and the code isn't bad to do
 Streak#8889: the pdf's advice seems real good and understandable
 JamiesonH#0334: haha are you getting closer?
 Streak#8889: Like it's so annoyingly achievable
 Streak#8889: if we didn't sleep till we get it
 Streak#8889: if i pulled the all nighter or something
 Streak#8889: I actually feel like I could get it
 Streak#8889: god i wish the olympiad and last day wasn't tomorrow
 JamiesonH#0334: its over ;-;
 Professor Chaos#9143: I wish lol
 JamiesonH#0334: anyone managed it or going to managae it in the next two minutes?
 JamiesonH#0334: ggs everyone
 Streak#8889: haven't gotten far enough to see
 JamiesonH#0334: im trying a simulated annealing on it
 JamiesonH#0334: is it looking like it'll work
 Streak#8889: can hop back in vc
 Streak#8889: not yet, i'm still working on code from the paper above
 JamiesonH#0334: did anyone get it
 JamiesonH#0334: cipher challenge more like cring
 Streak#8889: Those are gonna be very helpful
 Streak#8889: If anyone's got ideas for starting or ending cribs though, pls do suggest
 JamiesonH#0334: Hehe
 Streak#8889: if only 😭
 JamiesonH#0334: Did harry post it
 Streak#8889: years of research
 JamiesonH#0334: Where did you get that link
 Streak#8889: but any of them like Nightingale, Boole, etc can work
 Streak#8889: Babbage is particularly good for repeating the BA cause BABXBAGE
 Streak#8889: atm the best cribs I can think of are names
 JamiesonH#0334: I'm still out
 JamiesonH#0334: Logan can you do that lol
 JamiesonH#0334: Sick
 Streak#8889: can we adapt this to 6x6 grids, and then use the same cribbing approach
 Streak#8889: This is what a past Cipher Challenge finalist did to beat the Playfair grid
 Streak#8889:    
 Streak#8889: Yeah
 JamiesonH#0334: Are you still working on playfair
 JamiesonH#0334: I think I have an idea for when I get home but idk
 Streak#8889: were desperate man
 Streak#8889: we need everything
 Streak#8889: ask whoever youre with to help with the cipher challenge pls
 JamiesonH#0334: Let us know if you guys get anything interesting
 JamiesonH#0334: Rip
 JamiesonH#0334: I'm out for dinner so can't work on it lol
 Choopies#5687: oh ok thanks
 Choopies#5687: yeah true
 Streak#8889: AI is a theme
 Choopies#5687: even small
 Choopies#5687: like will people that suck be able to make something
 Streak#8889: yeah, that's one thing you can be sure about
 Streak#8889: more fun with friends innit
 Choopies#5687: is it ai thing
 Streak#8889: mhm
 Choopies#5687: but its a team game 🤔
 Choopies#5687: ooooh
 Streak#8889: the email's all the info we'll give out for now 😶
 Choopies#5687: wait  sorry - what is the actual project lol
 Professor Chaos#9143: k
 Streak#8889: be with you in a sec nigel
 Choopies#5687: oh alright
 Choopies#5687: and shrey thats you right
 Streak#8889: Yeah I'll post the info here anyways, but please do let us know if you're gonna make a team
 Choopies#5687: btw im guessing if were in this discord we dont need to email for the email thing
 Streak#8889: Hopping in vc for a few minutes now, gonna try and see if I can work on analytically working towards a key
 ron0studios#4591: but google never followed up 🥲
 ron0studios#4591: I got an invite last year after searching up list comprehension during CS class in year 10
 ron0studios#4591: as in google foobar
 ron0studios#4591: anyone done foobar before?
 ron0studios#4591: 做得好
 JamiesonH#0334: But it only took like 2 houes
 JamiesonH#0334: Last year we did it at like 10am the next day
 Professor Chaos#9143: Probably need a message in teams
 JamiesonH#0334: I'll pop in later tonight
 Professor Chaos#9143: I can probably come if I don't fall asleep.
 ron0studios#4591: the last one
 ron0studios#4591: no challenge 10b
 Streak#8889: would be honoured if thecypher or cncm squad came too
 Streak#8889: See if we can't make more progress
 Streak#8889: Also might hop in vc once I get home
 Streak#8889: Like as in challenges 7,8,9?
 ron0studios#4591: nevermind I can't check myself lol
 ron0studios#4591: nevermind I can check myself lol
 ron0studios#4591: i mean in previous challenges
 JamiesonH#0334: No idea
 ron0studios#4591: how long does it usually take before someone solves the cipher???
 ron0studios#4591: we've been cheesing many of the A questions with this tool
 ron0studios#4591: one sec
 ron0studios#4591: cipher identifier
 JamiesonH#0334: which identifier
 ron0studios#4591: B
 JamiesonH#0334: which one
 ron0studios#4591: but it also said that for the last cipher when it was a hill
 ron0studios#4591: cipher identifier says it might be playfair
 JamiesonH#0334: maybe
 Streak#8889: Decoding it though..
 Streak#8889: So having the cipher is a good first step
 Streak#8889: I'm pretty convinced about Playfair though, there's just too many coincidences which the Playfair could explain
 Professor Chaos#9143: got nothing
 JamiesonH#0334: 👀👀👀
 Streak#8889: here's hoping someone has a revelation on the way back
 JamiesonH#0334: do this on the website console
 JamiesonH#0334: sematary
 JamiesonH#0334: nah
 Streak#8889: lofi beats to win cipher challenge to
 Streak#8889: mf be singing a different tune talking to mr johnson
 JamiesonH#0334: Fuck cipher tools  🤬
 notFenwick#4649: that’s not just any spotify page
 JamiesonH#0334: Bcos i ain't never give another man free promo 😪
 JamiesonH#0334: That's why our substitution code is the fastest in the game
 JamiesonH#0334: If it works , it works
 JamiesonH#0334: 👍👍
 Streak#8889: most normal cncm member
 JamiesonH#0334: You can not let trivial stuff like art get in the way of that
 JamiesonH#0334: I spend 22 hours of the day coding , 1h30 edging myself to the code I just wrote and 30 minutes sleeping
 Coloursplash#9680: could not agree more
 JamiesonH#0334: Art cringe sorry
 Coloursplash#9680: that helps
 Coloursplash#9680: you don’t have art coursework until 5:30
 Streak#8889: just add it to the website in the spirit of altruism
 Streak#8889: Lmao
 JamiesonH#0334: We have a secret trick up our sleeves❄️❄️👃👃
 notFenwick#4649: cncm number 1
 notFenwick#4649: true
 JamiesonH#0334: Good luck to everyone on cipher challenge tommorow except if you're not on cncm then I hope you struggle 👍
 notFenwick#4649: ben ive got a ben style on the website lol
 JamiesonH#0334: There was a new jailbreak released this morning
 Choopies#5687: acc im not sure
 Choopies#5687: i swear you can't bug a ps4 thats updated
 JamiesonH#0334: I know taran was the jailbreaking guy back in year 6 haha
 JamiesonH#0334: Anyone here know about jailbreaking ps4s
 JamiesonH#0334: okay.....
 ByName#9795: Jamie, tell Fen to use #21232d for background colours
 ByName#9795: Yeah it's some custom Ubuntu one I found and matched to the Monterey background image
 Streak#8889: mf got the resident rgb keyboard ofc
 Streak#8889: low key that is a pretty colour scheme
 Streak#8889: #vibes
 ByName#9795: Macro it
 JamiesonH#0334: i could speedrun it
 JamiesonH#0334: i love typing .map((chars)=>ALPHA[chars]).join("")
 Streak#8889: pogers
 JamiesonH#0334: love that
 JamiesonH#0334: woah
 JamiesonH#0334: 1
 JamiesonH#0334: 11
 JamiesonH#0334: its only shifted by
 Streak#8889: forwards by 1
 JamiesonH#0334: it does haha
 Streak#8889: think it says not found
 JamiesonH#0334: its too short to solve bruteforce youd have to check all 26 and cba
 Taz#9211: cant remember what it says
 JamiesonH#0334: yeah i assumed so
 Taz#9211: that's a caeser iirc
 JamiesonH#0334: fen is the only one who understands
 Streak#8889: true dark mode
 Streak#8889: replace every hex value with black
 ByName#9795: Idk enough CSS
 Streak#8889: hack the website just to change their theme
 ByName#9795: Change the darkmode theme slightly and it will match my desktop theme
 JamiesonH#0334: hehe
 Streak#8889: its now better at solving trans position ciphers
 Streak#8889: lets go fen x2
 Streak#8889: do it again
 Streak#8889: Lmao lets go fen
 JamiesonH#0334: fen broke our site four days before the final challenge smh
 Streak#8889: is he ok
 JamiesonH#0334: quoi
 Streak#8889: just bruteforce all the possible ones innit
 Streak#8889: i think he did, maybe it was /christmas or /challenge or something?
 JamiesonH#0334: do u remember it
 JamiesonH#0334: i wonder if he took down the url in the end
 JamiesonH#0334: oh yeah it was funny
 Streak#8889: funny guy
 Streak#8889: was it hex? idr but it ended up being like a buncha christmas jokes
 JamiesonH#0334: and you put it all together and it was hex or something
 Streak#8889: mhm
 JamiesonH#0334: yeah that was fun
 Streak#8889: with the rotating text every second
 Streak#8889: that one
 Streak#8889: Yeah
 JamiesonH#0334: lmao
 Streak#8889: the whole class got it
 Streak#8889: i went to go talk to henry and aadeeb copied and pasted what i had onto Teams 😭
 JamiesonH#0334: was it one built into ciphertools
 JamiesonH#0334: idk if you had the same challenge as us
 Streak#8889: a couple people from the current thecypher team were doing it
 Streak#8889: last year was shambles for us lol
 Streak#8889: I mean i have CS on monday so maybe then?
 JamiesonH#0334: me and logan were in a team and caught the dub
 JamiesonH#0334: i remember it being so fun last year
 JamiesonH#0334: what day
 Streak#8889: small competitor to the cipher challenge ofc
 Streak#8889: mr johnsons christmas challenge also drops next week
 JamiesonH#0334: yep!
 JamiesonH#0334: they probs wont but the research i put in is useful anyway
 Streak#8889: save the planet and all that
 Streak#8889: maybe they'll recycle
 Streak#8889: Lol
 JamiesonH#0334: i just coded solution to one of the previous years final challenge
 JamiesonH#0334: eh kinda
 Streak#8889: you trying to predict what the final challenge is?
 JamiesonH#0334: mr johnson could never do what i can smh
 JamiesonH#0334: i mean theres no where else to solve this particular cipher online i dont wanna be giving gifts to people
 Streak#8889: strategies look at this
 JamiesonH#0334: probs keep it offline until after we have done the final challenge
 Streak#8889: will the famous website see it
 Streak#8889: happy days
 JamiesonH#0334: on bright side the code is working
 JamiesonH#0334: toooooo lateeeeeeeeeeeeee arghhh
 Streak#8889: drop history
 Streak#8889: er
 Streak#8889: er in that case
 JamiesonH#0334: its history coursework lol
 Streak#8889: the cipher grind is real
 Streak#8889: just tell mr johnson he'll understand
 JamiesonH#0334: 'i have coursework due tommorrow and i cant draw myself to do it until i finish code for the final challenge ;-;
 JamiesonH#0334: i think im addicted to cipher challenge
 ron0studios#4591: cribbage = kingage
 Streak#8889: just copying cribbage innit
 JamiesonH#0334: if you look at the individual weeks its pretty obvious that we arent
 JamiesonH#0334: yeah they probs do lol
 Streak#8889: how do we explain that we're just cracked
 Streak#8889: wait ppl probably think we're copying cause we're both at the top of the leaderboard
 Streak#8889: you could hypothetically copy the hypothetical other teams and hypothetically win
 JamiesonH#0334: haha
 Streak#8889: lets say you went to a hypothetical school hypothetically called Congleton High School
 JamiesonH#0334: i will ctrl c ctrl v on here for money
 Streak#8889: hypothetically one person could do it and everyone else could copy
 Streak#8889: but yeah
 Choopies#5687: oh ok
 JamiesonH#0334: its not really a school competiton
 Choopies#5687: wait im confused - if its a school competition, cant one person just do it and everyone esle copy
 JamiesonH#0334: It tries to tackle maybe 100 different ciphers so it ends up being way too broad and offers little practical advice in the end
 JamiesonH#0334: But it's not that good imo
 JamiesonH#0334: He has a cryptanalysis book
 JamiesonH#0334: Cipher expert
 JamiesonH#0334: He's like some old man
 ron0studios#4591: apparently he was really good
 ron0studios#4591: who is "madness" btw?
 JamiesonH#0334: You can figure it out on your own anyway it'll just be hard
 ron0studios#4591: oh no
 JamiesonH#0334: It's tough on younger years cos there's stuff involved u don't do until further maths
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah haha
 ron0studios#4591: just started a few mins ago
 ron0studios#4591: all i know atm is that its a 2 square
 ron0studios#4591: dang part b is weird
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah lol
 Streak#8889: it's that for like 6 rounds anyways lol
 JamiesonH#0334: Who can copy and paste quickest
 Streak#8889: plot twist it's in english
 JamiesonH#0334: We would win by approximately 8 seconds
 JamiesonH#0334: Fax
 Leavinq#1285: hope it's Substitution so we can flex the algorithm 💪💪
 JamiesonH#0334: I don't want it to end :0
 JamiesonH#0334: Crazy
 JamiesonH#0334: Next week is the real one
 henindapen#2396: What can i say 🤷
 JamiesonH#0334: Logan got it for us this week
 JamiesonH#0334: My man carrying
 JamiesonH#0334: Simple 🤞🤞
 Taz#9211: 
 JamiesonH#0334: Is he on here
 Taz#9211: got it last week as well
 Taz#9211: Big up Henry
 Streak#8889: hehe
 JamiesonH#0334: Nvm hehe
 JamiesonH#0334: i gave u one last week uwu
 JamiesonH#0334: will u repay me and give us clue lol
 Streak#8889: Shoutout to herny
 JamiesonH#0334: stop being mysterious smh
 Streak#8889: Yeah we got it lol
 Streak#8889: maybe we all ragequit
 JamiesonH#0334: bruh so cryptic
 Streak#8889: perhaps
 JamiesonH#0334: Did you lot get it ?
 JamiesonH#0334: Come one cypher !!!
 JamiesonH#0334: We are so close to top 3 kegs
 Streak#8889: lets get this kegs
 Streak#8889: people dropping like flies
 JamiesonH#0334: Damnnnnn barely anyone could do this lol
 ByName#9795: Apparently their were loads, did he just sit and watch
 ByName#9795: Their main head inspector or just the one for kegs?
 ron0studios#4591: didn't know he was the head 😬
 ron0studios#4591: that same ofsted person interviewed our group today
 JamiesonH#0334: Maybe try him on snap ?
 JamiesonH#0334: I sent him a message
 JamiesonH#0334: Ben whats up with same lol
 Streak#8889: mans watching me waffle about Neural Networks
 Streak#8889: apparently it was their Head Inspector as well
 Streak#8889: Yeah lmao
 ByName#9795: Did ofsted come to the meeting today?
 Choopies#5687: I BUY FOR 40004534533$!
 Choopies#5687: HOLY BOLY!!!!!!!!!111111111111!1!!!
 JamiesonH#0334: It's a piss take lol
 Choopies#5687: show the art jamie
 JamiesonH#0334: I have £12 I need this nft to sell to fund my extravagant lifestyle
 JamiesonH#0334: You fellas is broke !!!
 Streak#8889: if only it was 4299 then you could have afforded it ez
 JamiesonH#0334: Smh
 Taz#9211: but unfortunately $4300 is a bit out of my budget
 Taz#9211: sorry bro i'd love to support your work as a cooltext.com artist
 JamiesonH#0334: Inshallah it goes up
 JamiesonH#0334: But it fluctuates a lot between like 4 and 5 grand rn
 JamiesonH#0334: $4,300 rn
 Taz#9211: gee thanks
 Streak#8889: about half of 2 eth
 Taz#9211: how much is 1 eth?
 JamiesonH#0334: The listing is still processing but it's going for one Eth hehe
 JamiesonH#0334: I made it with cooltext.com and word lol
 Taz#9211: did u draw it urself?
 JamiesonH#0334: Nft
 JamiesonH#0334: Who wants to buy my mft
 ByName#9795: All at once
 ByName#9795: Yes
 JamiesonH#0334: imperial has 3 supercomputers do u think i could use them
 JamiesonH#0334: ah yes
 ByName#9795: Just run it on a faster computer, problem solved
 JamiesonH#0334: All the methods I've tried are either not accurate enough or take way too long
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah
 Taz#9211: sounds tricky then
 Taz#9211: ah i see
 JamiesonH#0334: Would take n! ( Where n is the key length for the transposition key) lots of substitution ciphers
 JamiesonH#0334: Brute forcing is also not possible
 JamiesonH#0334: It could theoretically work but only for like  1 key out if the 26! Possible ones
 JamiesonH#0334: I was wrong
 JamiesonH#0334: Nah that doesn't work
 Taz#9211: are u using the hill climbing method u told me abt before?
 JamiesonH#0334: It's a hard problem
 JamiesonH#0334: I am going insane trying to make code that would have solved 8b without knowing any of the keys
 Streak#8889: cipher challenge broke him
 Streak#8889: > I go outside more than you still
Poor guys going insane
 JamiesonH#0334: Poor dude
 JamiesonH#0334: I'll message him on Twitter tommorow lol
 Streak#8889: we believe in you xeemo
 notFenwick#4649: i hope xeemo got it 😔
 JamiesonH#0334: Pray for xeemo 🙏🙏
 Karan.7519#8652: Does it mean anything in java?
 Karan.7519#8652: I wonder why they called it eclipse though
 ByName#9795: The best java ide
 Karan.7519#8652: ?
 ByName#9795: Netbeans
 JamiesonH#0334: Intellij logo is cool
 Karan.7519#8652: I like the logo as well
 Karan.7519#8652: I agree eclipse is a cool name
 JamiesonH#0334: I've spoken to him and he seems kinda annoying ngl
 JamiesonH#0334: Is he a bad teache rlol
 Choopies#5687: clearly you haven't had mr seed
 Streak#8889: Mums tysm
 JamiesonH#0334:  just been told ' the java tutorials' on oracle are v good
 Streak#8889: worse name but probs better ide
 Streak#8889: maybs
 JamiesonH#0334: Just use intellije maybe
 Streak#8889: 🏃‍♂️
 Streak#8889: and..
do you have to
like have to
use eclipse
 Streak#8889: or like the general idea of oop and how to structure it n all
 Streak#8889: would you say its better to learn like syntax and all first
 Streak#8889: maybe i can actually use my head now
 Streak#8889: i started it ages ago but that was when i was god awful at computer science
 Streak#8889: i'll try it
 Streak#8889: rip
 JamiesonH#0334: That was pretty good but I never finished it
 JamiesonH#0334: I started the codeacademy java tutorial acc
 Streak#8889: i learnt the ez bits so now i'm just tryna get comfortable enough with it to move onto React
 JamiesonH#0334: Java is harder imo
 JamiesonH#0334: Js is pretty ez if ur doing vanilla stuff
 Streak#8889: ig i'll have to learn java outside of it
 Streak#8889: was planning to learn js in my project so
 Streak#8889: huh
 Streak#8889: at least he doesnt randomly start waffling about orgies _cough_
 Streak#8889: nah its not that bad 🙄
 JamiesonH#0334: But It was a Java 3d graphics tutorial not java tutorial, I just kinda picked everything up along the way
 Streak#8889: 👀 👀
 Taz#9211: ms coates of the comp sci department
 Taz#9211: jobless teacher
 Taz#9211: lmaoo
 JamiesonH#0334: Yr12*
 JamiesonH#0334: Haha I learnt mainly from this tutorial I did for my yr13 project
 Streak#8889: been a whole term we've had maybe like 3 java lessons
 Streak#8889: doesnt help we've missed nearly every one
 Streak#8889: ngl mr sims lessons arent cutting it
 Streak#8889: btw how'd you learn java
 JamiesonH#0334: Yep 😎
 JamiesonH#0334: Something to do with twos complement binary lol
 Streak#8889: what idea was it?
 Streak#8889: awwww
 JamiesonH#0334: I never felt more proud when he coined my idea " Jamie's algorithm" 🥺
 JamiesonH#0334: I miss those hehee
 JamiesonH#0334: What are his programming challenges
 JamiesonH#0334: What the context of those emojis ahah
 Streak#8889: 'you got 10% on the test 😭 😭 '
 Streak#8889: it's only a matter of time before he hits us with the
 JamiesonH#0334: Lol whattt
 ron0studios#4591: it was pretty cool
 ron0studios#4591: yh
 Choopies#5687: ty
 Choopies#5687: oh ok
 JamiesonH#0334: cr4
 JamiesonH#0334: got some questions to ask him
 JamiesonH#0334: yeah im going tommorow
 Choopies#5687: what room
 Choopies#5687: where are they?
 Choopies#5687: i might go to one
 Choopies#5687: oh alright
 Streak#8889: and mr johnson has cipher club on fridays
 JamiesonH#0334: start from the beginning and use the resources on the cipherchallenge.org website
 Choopies#5687: sure lol
 Streak#8889: nah go for it its fun
 Choopies#5687: but i might try
 JamiesonH#0334: its ez
 Choopies#5687: i probably wouldnt be able to lol
 Streak#8889: the text is there to solve 🤷
 Choopies#5687: oh lol
 Streak#8889: you can still do the challenges though
 JamiesonH#0334: always next year tho lol
 JamiesonH#0334: yeah it is soz
 Choopies#5687: i have no idea what it is
 Choopies#5687: wait is it too late to start cypher challenge
 JamiesonH#0334: Rudrrayan have you done cipher challenge 8b
 JamiesonH#0334: Sure
 ron0studios#4591: they are awful its hilarious
 ron0studios#4591: wait does anyone want to see my gamejam submissions
 ron0studios#4591: ooh cool games
 JamiesonH#0334: i dont got it
 JamiesonH#0334: bruh it worked once then stoopped i swr
 JamiesonH#0334: u can
 JamiesonH#0334: nvm i got it
 JamiesonH#0334: like f.bind(this, args) in javascript
 JamiesonH#0334: can u bind arguements to a function in lua
 Streak#8889: spooky
 Choopies#5687: obvs left
 Streak#8889: what it gon do
 Streak#8889: smiley face wit da sword
 JamiesonH#0334: its just changing a couple values tbf
 Streak#8889: in that case top right innit
 JamiesonH#0334: i agree but it also means changing code grr
 Streak#8889: imo top left but i'm a zelda boy
 JamiesonH#0334: Haha sick
 ByName#9795: Yep, that sounds good. I will do some fancy sharepoint web design stuff!
 JamiesonH#0334: Should I just upload the code there and send u the writing stuff ?
 JamiesonH#0334: Thanks Ben
 Choopies#5687: alright
 ByName#9795: invited you, you should have got an email
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah it's the same programming language , you just use a different game engine
 JamiesonH#0334: JamieHolloway182
 Choopies#5687: so it wont be too weird
 Choopies#5687: is this lua similar to roblox lua?
 Choopies#5687: k cool
 JamiesonH#0334: Do that first yeah
 Choopies#5687: yh
 JamiesonH#0334: The gd50 tutorial?
 Choopies#5687: but ive got everything set up - should i follow the pong tutorial?
 Choopies#5687:  sorry for asking so many questions
 ByName#9795: whats your github username, ill add you as an owner
 JamiesonH#0334: Can u send a link
 JamiesonH#0334: I didn't know that was a thing
 ByName#9795: Make one in the coding club github group
 JamiesonH#0334: Ben do u wanna make a coding club repo or should I
 JamiesonH#0334: Hurrah
 ByName#9795: Activity has recommenced on coding club! (Mainly because I'm procrastinating my EPQ)
 JamiesonH#0334: Swag
 Choopies#5687: i do
 Choopies#5687: yh
 JamiesonH#0334: If not get that
 JamiesonH#0334: Do u have Vs code
 Choopies#5687: thans
 Choopies#5687: k
 JamiesonH#0334: Watch first 5 or so mins of this
 Choopies#5687: k thanks
 Choopies#5687: god i already have 10000 questions
 JamiesonH#0334: Holdup I'll send u a video
 Choopies#5687: did you start off with pong
 Choopies#5687: like what do i install
 Choopies#5687:  is it love2d
 JamiesonH#0334: Okay I'll add that then
 ByName#9795: i can structure it on site
 ByName#9795: if theres something to mark whats what thats fine
 JamiesonH#0334: Uhmm they are all in same file rn
 JamiesonH#0334: It handles everything for u tbh
 JamiesonH#0334: It's so easy for game dev
 ByName#9795: Ill put intro on one page then instructions on others
 ByName#9795: Is that intro and instructions?
 Choopies#5687: oh ok
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah Ben
 Choopies#5687: was that from the box
 JamiesonH#0334: You use one library for graphics but it's like super simple and u don't even use it much
 ByName#9795: Are all lua instructions in the word doc?
 Choopies#5687: the main menu
 Choopies#5687: like your zelda game
 JamiesonH#0334: No it's all implemented out the box
 Choopies#5687: or do you have to create yourself
 Choopies#5687: and art
 Choopies#5687: is there a library for sounds and things
 Choopies#5687: 
 Choopies#5687: jamie last quesiton
 JamiesonH#0334: 🤠🤠
 Choopies#5687: angry burd
 Choopies#5687: hmmmm
 JamiesonH#0334: Mashallah
 Choopies#5687: when i become billionaire i will put your name in the game
 Taz#9211: calm then
 JamiesonH#0334: Tell Sasha I got you to do some work hehe
 JamiesonH#0334: Let's goooo
 JamiesonH#0334: It'll teach it within the frame of game design
 Choopies#5687: okay thanks a lot jamie ill do it
 JamiesonH#0334: But it won't like give u a proper coding or theoretical explanation
 JamiesonH#0334: Uhhm yeah a little
 ByName#9795: and has some demo stuff from the welfare platforms on it
 Taz#9211: like object oriented programming and shit?
 ByName#9795: Need to remove some things first because its just a buncch of test stuff
 Choopies#5687: thank
 JamiesonH#0334: But not as much about like principles of a good game sort of thing
 JamiesonH#0334: But it teaches u lots of major concepts involved in making games
 Choopies#5687: alright ill give it a go
 Choopies#5687: okay cool
 Choopies#5687: theres a website?
 JamiesonH#0334: Both mainly coding tho
 ByName#9795: If you send the word doc ill make some fancy thing on the coding club website
 Choopies#5687: very modest
 Taz#9211:  does it teach u about game design or purely coding
 JamiesonH#0334: yeah it is
 Choopies#5687: okay ngl i watched a vid it looks rlly good
 ByName#9795: Ok. ye probably best to put it all on GitHub as a repo
 JamiesonH#0334: ehhh its a series of lectures so just watch the vids and you can choose to do the coding challenges at the end of each video
 Choopies#5687: pretty much
 Choopies#5687: is it pure programming
 Choopies#5687: like what i mean
 Choopies#5687: is it possible to get distracted
 JamiesonH#0334: at least game dev stuff
 JamiesonH#0334: just from that
 JamiesonH#0334: yeah
 Choopies#5687: wait did you learn from doing that
 JamiesonH#0334: one font file
 ByName#9795: All of code?
 JamiesonH#0334: mario video is best
 JamiesonH#0334: richard , in order to convince u to do the course i sent, heres my yt channel with everything i made from the course
 JamiesonH#0334: its like 6 files
 ByName#9795: Logic gates and stuff
 ByName#9795: Not a half bad idea tbh
 ByName#9795: How much stuff is there?
 JamiesonH#0334: might have to make a repo
 JamiesonH#0334: ben how should i share it
 Choopies#5687: # redstone club
 Choopies#5687: oh thats cool
 Taz#9211: that sounds fun tbh
 ByName#9795: Also we should totally do Minecraft java programming and subcontract out craftcadia
 Taz#9211: all of the code at the top was auto-generated
 Choopies#5687: i would have given up on 5th line ngl
 Choopies#5687: how did you have the patience for that
 Choopies#5687: wait whattttt
 ByName#9795: If it's fully ready to go send it and I'll post either today/tomorrow
 Choopies#5687: thats a lot of variables lol
 Choopies#5687: i think we should report him to roblox
 Choopies#5687: roblox developer union
 JamiesonH#0334: grrrr
 Choopies#5687: lolll
 Choopies#5687: but i was learning from alvinblox
 Taz#9211: i was ass at building icl i just made my friend do it all
 Choopies#5687: like 1% was actually the coding
 Taz#9211: ohh yh
 Choopies#5687: and talking on discord
 Choopies#5687: the thing is when I was doing it I always got distracted with like the building aspect
 Taz#9211: i used to hack in war groups
 Choopies#5687: hacking adopt me 😎
 Choopies#5687: lol
 Taz#9211: also i made scripts for roblox hacks but we dont talk about that
 Choopies#5687: epic roblox gamer
 Taz#9211: it's how i learnt
 JamiesonH#0334: yeah ive only just ahd the time to get round to my comsci nea
 Taz#9211: it's actually a really good way of learning to program
 Choopies#5687: yeah i have lol
 Taz#9211: have u ever made roblox games?
 Taz#9211: fair enough
 JamiesonH#0334: all the stuff is essentially ready to be put out for challenge 1 ben ngl
 Choopies#5687: oh ok
 ByName#9795: Very good question, we e been meaning to do stuff with it for multiple months and just haven't had time
 Taz#9211: roblox has it's own specific version of lua though i think
 Choopies#5687: oh ok
 Choopies#5687: lua ++ or something
 Taz#9211: nah its used by tons of games
 JamiesonH#0334: nah
 Choopies#5687: or are there different versions
 JamiesonH#0334: i forgot lol
 Taz#9211: speaking of coding club, what's actually going on with that?
 Choopies#5687: i swear lua is for roblox only
 JamiesonH#0334: bru im so busy ;-;
 ByName#9795: Lua for coding club when
 Choopies#5687: yeah true lol
 Choopies#5687: okay ill watch it now, thanks a lot
 Taz#9211: u have tons of time then
 JamiesonH#0334: it'll require a decent amount of time but its v good
 Taz#9211: oh calm
 Taz#9211: yh
 Choopies#5687: 10
 Choopies#5687: me?
 Taz#9211: what yr are u in
 JamiesonH#0334: yeah its good for that
 Streak#8889: see the word zelda i'm hooked
 Choopies#5687: I'm only doing this project for learning and experience
 Taz#9211: that may be waffle but that's how i understand it
 Choopies#5687: idk it sounds interesting but what do you think?
 Taz#9211: afaik the aim of lua is to expose underlying compiled code in a way that doesnt expose the source code but makes it easy to work with from a modding perspective
 Taz#9211: yeah i've written lua mods for factorio before
 JamiesonH#0334: yeah its just a super easy language
 Streak#8889: mods
 Taz#9211: its purpose is for games and modding apis
 Taz#9211: i dont think it claims to be though
 Taz#9211: no lmao
 Choopies#5687: thats sickkk
 Streak#8889: js
 Streak#8889: as opposed to like
 Choopies#5687: DAMNN
 Streak#8889: is lua terribly useful outside of games tho no offense
 Taz#9211: 🥶
 JamiesonH#0334: like u dont have to change the code at all for it to be a site
 Streak#8889: mf got da parallax
 JamiesonH#0334: richard if u learn to use lua and love2d, its so easy to make games , easier than python and you can easily make it a website
 Choopies#5687: after pigeonblox
 Choopies#5687: my favourite youtuber
 JamiesonH#0334: here
 Choopies#5687: each time it evolves
 Choopies#5687: is that like
 Streak#8889: he's cracked
 Taz#9211: your scholarship at cambridge awaits
 Choopies#5687: wait
 Taz#9211: you've invented a new procedural generation algorithm
 Taz#9211: 😂 😂 😂
 Choopies#5687: that sounds like my level
 JamiesonH#0334: i'll send a vid
 JamiesonH#0334: its pretty shit
 Choopies#5687: wait whats the game
 JamiesonH#0334: the procedural generation is not working how i intended it to but it is somehow producing better random generation despite that
 Choopies#5687: is that supposed to be the case
 Choopies#5687: sick
 JamiesonH#0334: my game for my computer science coursework is working by not working
 Taz#9211: nws
 Choopies#5687: I'll see but thanks a lot anyway
 Taz#9211: there might be ways but i havent heard of them
 Taz#9211: afaik at least
 Choopies#5687: oh okay
 Taz#9211: yeah even a basic one
 Taz#9211: rn the best you can get is probs just playing on the same computer
 Choopies#5687: even a very basic one
 Taz#9211: it isnt easy to make a multiplayer game that runs on a website
 Choopies#5687: oh okay yeah thats fine
 Choopies#5687: nop
 Choopies#5687: sorry if i sound stupid
 Taz#9211: well it's like it's just not at all compatible, you'd have to rewrite it completely
 JamiesonH#0334: do u know javascript richard
 Choopies#5687: tbh i'm kind of confused about it
 Choopies#5687: how would you change it?
 Choopies#5687: oh lol
 Taz#9211: i dont think u can run that on a website
 Choopies#5687: ei?
 Taz#9211: ah ic
 JamiesonH#0334: Rewrite it in assembly code and use wazm smh
 Choopies#5687: There

 Choopies#5687: first past:
 Taz#9211: can u send the code here?
 Taz#9211: flask and django are python, they just help you write stuff for servers
 Choopies#5687: it's not too complicated as I haven't been learning for too long
 Choopies#5687: i wrote it in python
 Choopies#5687: just something simple
 Choopies#5687: yeah
 Choopies#5687: yeah I was thinking of using django
 Taz#9211: actually if u just send the code it'll probs be easier to help
 Taz#9211: like have u written it in flask/django and just want to run it on some server?
 Taz#9211: wdym put on a website?
 Choopies#5687: and also i guess this is for  , but I've written a python thing that I want to put on a website for basic multiplayer, what would be the easiest thing to use?
 Taz#9211: dont bait it out shrey
 Choopies#5687: cover up the evidence
 Taz#9211: 🤫
 Choopies#5687: lol
 Streak#8889: compsoc conspiracies
 Choopies#5687: 🤔
 Streak#8889: suspiciously similar names
 Choopies#5687: oh ok
 Streak#8889: Last time was Karan
 Choopies#5687: epic
 JamiesonH#0334: At prism we are making gay badges
 Choopies#5687: was that who did it last time?
 Streak#8889: I'll ping later today
 Choopies#5687: oh cool
 Streak#8889: Yeah there's one by Mr 
 Streak#8889: Lmao
 JamiesonH#0334: So true
 Choopies#5687: alright thanks bye
 Choopies#5687: 😠
 JamiesonH#0334: For what :0
 Choopies#5687: I'm going to have to report you for this Mr Holloway.
 JamiesonH#0334: V cheeky but sadly Mr levitt is no Turing machine expert
 JamiesonH#0334: I'm gonna ask Mr Johnson to check my personal statement before it starts tommorow hehe
 JamiesonH#0334: I believe there is
 JamiesonH#0334: Yo my man Richard
 Choopies#5687: Is there a talk on tommorow
 ByName#9795: Budapest?
 ron0studios#4591: oh
 JamiesonH#0334: Nah the other maximillian 😏
 ron0studios#4591: His udemy courses are great
 ron0studios#4591: as in shwarzmuller?
 ron0studios#4591: I know maximillian
 ByName#9795: Ye I did his flutter course the other year
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah he's cool guy
 ByName#9795: Academind is Maximilian right?
 JamiesonH#0334: And ofc other things are learnt in the fly
 JamiesonH#0334: I just watched the traversy media tutorial for reqct and academind for next and It was enough for my first projects
 JamiesonH#0334: React and next are pretty easy tbf
 JamiesonH#0334: Fair enough
 ron0studios#4591: also has some nice routing
 ron0studios#4591: apparently vue is easier, and it looks clean
 ron0studios#4591: ive never done a frontend framework before
 ron0studios#4591: nope
 JamiesonH#0334: Do u know react?
 JamiesonH#0334: You can do rest APIs with next so it's good
 ron0studios#4591: and soon enough I'll be able to make something decent
 ron0studios#4591: My current plan is to just make projects, if I don't know how to do something I search it up
 ron0studios#4591: should i just stop and redo it?
 ron0studios#4591: ive already started out with the core stuff with vue though
 ron0studios#4591: oh ok
 JamiesonH#0334: Means it's good
 ron0studios#4591: what is go dutty
 JamiesonH#0334: Next js go dutty
 JamiesonH#0334: Learn next instead is my advice
 ron0studios#4591: I've done a bit of JS. My main language is c++ and python
 ron0studios#4591: Anyone got any tips on learning vuejs?
 Choopies#5687: oh lol thanks still
 JamiesonH#0334: far from the most efficient method lol , my css is kinda lame
 JamiesonH#0334:

 Choopies#5687: yeah thats fine
 JamiesonH#0334: I'll send later playing smash Bros with zachy
 JamiesonH#0334: Idk there might be but idk about it
 Choopies#5687: is there a program in html similar to turtle?
 Choopies#5687: yeah could you
 Choopies#5687: yeah i see it
 JamiesonH#0334: I can send the full thing if u wan t
 JamiesonH#0334: The code is there on the left of my image
 Choopies#5687: it looks so complex
 Choopies#5687: how is that even possible
 Choopies#5687: no idea what it is but looks very epic
 Streak#8889: Mona Lisa 2.0
 Streak#8889: beautiful
 notFenwick#4649:
 Taz#9211: bingus
 Streak#8889: bald cat poggers?
 Streak#8889: I don't think that's a dog but wtf is it
 Streak#8889: Karan getcho classification algorithm in here
 Streak#8889: wtf are my eyes comprehend
 JamiesonH#0334: turing machines solve the halting problem after all
 JamiesonH#0334: i mean turing is kinda central to computability theory
 ByName#9795: Jamie show the 3d posters
 JamiesonH#0334: okiiiii
 ron0studios#4591: nah just advanced algorithms and computability theory
 JamiesonH#0334: computability theory
 JamiesonH#0334: like turing machines
 ron0studios#4591: wdym
 ron0studios#4591: turing stuff?
 JamiesonH#0334: turing stuff?
 ron0studios#4591: more of the theoretical stuff
 ron0studios#4591: yh she likes CS aswell
 JamiesonH#0334: dw
 JamiesonH#0334: pretty swag
 ron0studios#4591: typo
 JamiesonH#0334: i didnt know but i saw she has a badge saying it
 JamiesonH#0334: she tho
 JamiesonH#0334: friendship ended
 ron0studios#4591: she tagged along in one of them
 ron0studios#4591: sort of
 ron0studios#4591: we've been in the same class both lower and middle school
 JamiesonH#0334: wait is alison in ur cipher challenege team
 ron0studios#4591: yh
 ron0studios#4591: prism be dripping
 JamiesonH#0334: are you friends then ?
 JamiesonH#0334: swag
 ron0studios#4591: she told me abt it
 ron0studios#4591: yh
 JamiesonH#0334: she comes prism for the last couple weeks
 JamiesonH#0334: yeah vaguely
 ron0studios#4591: you know alison btw?
 ron0studios#4591: d
 ron0studios#4591: oh yh i hear
 JamiesonH#0334: we did graphic design at prism lol, making designs for badges
 Karan.7519#8652: Cheers 👍
 JamiesonH#0334: karan dub
 ron0studios#4591: without overcomplicating it
 ron0studios#4591: karan's really good at explaining stuff
 ron0studios#4591: it was fun
 JamiesonH#0334: Oki
 Choopies#5687: yes itt was very epic
 JamiesonH#0334: How did it go today :0
 Choopies#5687:
 Choopies#5687:
 ByName#9795: Digital nomad mindset
 ByName#9795: Do it while traveling
 Streak#8889: yeah that's unlucky man
 JamiesonH#0334: Sorry bro
 JamiesonH#0334: Ripppp
 ron0studios#4591: holiday ticket got rescheduled so we have to leave on the 17th
 JamiesonH#0334: How come
 JamiesonH#0334: Lol rip
 ron0studios#4591: I've been preparing for it for a while now, but now knowing the date, idk if I'll actually be able to do it
 ron0studios#4591: British Informatics Olympiad
 ron0studios#4591: yh
 ron0studios#4591: I might not be able to attend the BIO 😢
 JamiesonH#0334: Wish it could I'd probs be rich 🤑🤑
 JamiesonH#0334: I was joking lol it can't reverse hashes
 JamiesonH#0334: We do a little hacking
 Taz#9211: unless it's just the insecure hashes
 Taz#9211: that sounds like it has major implications for cybersecurity
 JamiesonH#0334: It can reverse hashes too
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah
 Streak#8889: MI6 and the CIA shaking rn
 JamiesonH#0334: Ezzzz
 JamiesonH#0334: Cncm has a neural network that can solve all ciphers lol
 Streak#8889: confident guy
 Streak#8889: big words
 JamiesonH#0334: I will have it instantly lol
 Streak#8889: Whoever gets the best score in the Olympiad gets the cipher solution off Mr Johnson ez
 Streak#8889: he's probs popping off somewhere
 JamiesonH#0334:  will be pleased hehe
 Streak#8889: busy days
 JamiesonH#0334: I hope Johnson appreciates my top humour
 Streak#8889: just clocked i forgot to put that one on there lol
 JamiesonH#0334: I want to die if I see him I'm gonna be so embarrassed
 Taz#9211: ah icic
 Streak#8889: In the middle of the run just ask him how he'd reverse a string
 Streak#8889: every situation is an opportunity
 Streak#8889: ask for extra interview advice
 JamiesonH#0334: And I might be  seeing him tommorow at parkrun 💀💀💀
 Streak#8889: How does the plot keep thickening 😭 😭
 JamiesonH#0334: I'm a very embarassing twist I showed my mum a pic of him from Google and she informed name that he used to live four doors down from our house and that she knows him well lol
 JamiesonH#0334: And yeah u can if you keep a pointer of where you're appending to
 JamiesonH#0334: Oh I misread ur message sorry lol
 Taz#9211: ik but is it possible to do it without recursion
 JamiesonH#0334: But I would've done it recursively If I wasn't panicking lol
 JamiesonH#0334: No I panicked and said I couldn't do it lolllll
 Taz#9211: can u do that without recursion?
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah it was
 Streak#8889: That sounds rough tbh
 Streak#8889: Is it like the pressure of coming up with it in the spot or smth
 Streak#8889: Bust out the f# at any point in time
 JamiesonH#0334: It's not even hard
 JamiesonH#0334: Which I've done in f# so I'm so mad lol
 JamiesonH#0334: You can do it recursively too
 Streak#8889: Ez dubs
 Streak#8889: No variables just append to it
 Streak#8889: Do a whole program in one string
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah I suppose haha
 Streak#8889: Then just delete the original half
 Streak#8889: For without a new string couldn't you just do that but append to the original string
 JamiesonH#0334: But he wanted me to reverse it in place which is super ez I'm so pissed lol
 JamiesonH#0334: String
 JamiesonH#0334: I did it my just looping through the string backwards and appending that value to a new swting
 JamiesonH#0334: They aren't
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah haha
 Streak#8889: strings aren't fixed length right
 Streak#8889: 💀
 JamiesonH#0334: I mean the second question was reversing a string lol it's not that hard tbh
 JamiesonH#0334: Nah I didn't do any prep
 Streak#8889: sounds hard
 Streak#8889: Did you grind questions for it or is it just like chillin
 Streak#8889: finessed
 Streak#8889: Huh
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah
 JamiesonH#0334: And then I used the optimisation of having a table that records all the state's so you don't like revisit them
 Streak#8889: The snakes and ladders one?
 JamiesonH#0334: Cos I used the tree of like states to answer the question
 Streak#8889: Lessgoo Karan
 JamiesonH#0334: Also karans minimax algorithm presentation saved me lol
 Streak#8889: holy grail strikes again?
 Streak#8889: 'so this one time it was like a wheel cipher, hold on lemme get a piece of paper and a circle'
 JamiesonH#0334: I answered the first question pretty well bcos I mentioned a recursive algorithm and he was like yes good boy
 Streak#8889: Lmao
 JamiesonH#0334: Bit they probs won't
 JamiesonH#0334: I hope they ask about cipjer challenge lol cos I could waffle about that for days
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah haha
 Streak#8889: like just enough to tell if you're waffling
 JamiesonH#0334: Nah but they'll probs ask you broad questions on the topic of the book
 Streak#8889: Do they read the books and ask you about them tf?
 JamiesonH#0334: Haha
 Streak#8889: Lmao
 Streak#8889: Mr Johnsons coming for your location
 JamiesonH#0334: But that's fairs cos he only asked it cos I wrote about a book on my statement that I haven't read yet
 JamiesonH#0334: He also asked me for a definition of functional programming which I kinda fucked
 JamiesonH#0334: Which I'm much more confident doing
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah
 Streak#8889: Oh so you gotta talk about those books and that?
 JamiesonH#0334: Only like Oxbridge imperial and maybe some others but idk
 JamiesonH#0334: Not many unis even interview for comsci
 JamiesonH#0334: Imperial will ask u more about personal statement which is good for me
 Streak#8889: is that different to others?
 JamiesonH#0334: But it was a Cambridge style interview and I'm not applying there
 Streak#8889: I mean at least it's only practice n all that
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah 100%
 Streak#8889: Like it's not just knowing stuff off like leetcode
 Streak#8889: Rip interview pressure seems like half the challenge tbh
 JamiesonH#0334: If I wasn't panicked I would've done that way but I couldn't lol
 JamiesonH#0334: Even though I've coded it recursively in f# already lol
 JamiesonH#0334: And then he said do it without a new string and I couldn't
 JamiesonH#0334: But it took a bit because I wrote it in python not pseudocode
 JamiesonH#0334: I wrote one first that took not long but it used a new string
 JamiesonH#0334: I did
 Streak#8889: Like the algo took ages or you did lol?
 Streak#8889: Still that's not a deep mistake right
 JamiesonH#0334: Took ages
 JamiesonH#0334: And then the string question I fucked up tbh
 Streak#8889: Ouch
 JamiesonH#0334: I answered that well but I mixed up polynomial time with exponential
 JamiesonH#0334: He asked me about a snakes and ladders game and how to write an algorithm to find the shortest roles needed to reach the end and then optimising it
 JamiesonH#0334: Ehhhh
 Streak#8889: Did it go okay?
 JamiesonH#0334: U have to write ur own alg in pseudocode
 JamiesonH#0334: Ur not allowed to do stuff like that lol
 Streak#8889: Wtf there's other programming languages than python?????
 Streak#8889: hit that [::-1]
 Streak#8889: Oof how did it go
 JamiesonH#0334: Just had practice uni interview
 JamiesonH#0334: Bro asked me to reverse a string without making a new string but I was so scared that I couldn't
 Streak#8889: Wdym?
 JamiesonH#0334: Computer science uni interviews ask u such simple questions but it's so scary still
 JamiesonH#0334: So true!
 Streak#8889: 
 Streak#8889: 🐏
 ByName#9795: RAM
 Streak#8889: 
 JamiesonH#0334: bcos the first word of the part b decrypt is some silly word smh
 Streak#8889: sticky one
 JamiesonH#0334: wasnt too bad, it took me 2 mins but i didnt realise i had solved part b so submitted after 5 mins
 JamiesonH#0334: nice
 Streak#8889: we're about to finish
 Karan.7519#8652: We just finished lol
 JamiesonH#0334: are u lot doing it now?
 JamiesonH#0334: i finished a few mins ago
 Karan.7519#8652: You too
 JamiesonH#0334: good luck on cipher challenge u lot
 SaiTenneti#5976:
 JamiesonH#0334: Cya
 JamiesonH#0334: Oki lol
 ron0studios#4591: ok i gtg now bye
 ron0studios#4591: my generation size is 100
 ron0studios#4591: ill have to double check though
 ron0studios#4591: 20 ish generations, then it kind of plateu's from then on
 JamiesonH#0334: How many iterations does it normally take u to reach the local minimum
 JamiesonH#0334: Fair enough
 ron0studios#4591: I just followed Shrey's powerpoint lol
 ron0studios#4591: I have no clue what that is
 JamiesonH#0334: Did u use jakobsens method
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah
 ron0studios#4591: you using webasm with rust then?
 ron0studios#4591: I mean I haven't measured it yet but definitely way less than a second
 ron0studios#4591: yh rusts a good idea
 JamiesonH#0334: How quick is urs
 JamiesonH#0334: Ours is JavaScript but imma do it in rust eventually
 JamiesonH#0334: Fairs
 ron0studios#4591: mainlly so my friends can also work on it
 ron0studios#4591: python
 JamiesonH#0334: Language
 JamiesonH#0334: What did u code it in
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah same as ours
 ron0studios#4591: stuck at a local minimum as far as I can guess
 ron0studios#4591: mutations dont fix it either
 ron0studios#4591: it solves like 90% of it but a few letters are always off
 ron0studios#4591: genetic algorithm
 JamiesonH#0334: What substitution method are u using
 JamiesonH#0334: Vigenere is ezzz
 ron0studios#4591: Substitution's a bit broken
 ron0studios#4591: Its going alright. We're going to start vignere soon
 JamiesonH#0334: How's ur cipher solver going
 ron0studios#4591: yh lol
 JamiesonH#0334: Oh were u busy Thursday
 ron0studios#4591: but on friday
 ron0studios#4591: half an hour or so
 JamiesonH#0334: How long did they take u
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah
 ron0studios#4591: the hint in A was very useful and B was fun
 JamiesonH#0334: How did u find week 5
 ron0studios#4591: we aren't really that active atm
 ron0studios#4591: Yeagerists
 JamiesonH#0334: What's ur team name for cipher challeneg
 ron0studios#4591: Hi
 ron0studios#4591: How was linear regression?
 JamiesonH#0334: Yo rudrrayan
 ron0studios#4591: sorry I wasn't able to come to the club this week
 ByName#9795: Explain the lore
 Streak#8889: essential worldbuilding smh smh
 JamiesonH#0334: Ben doesn't know the cipher challenege lore smh
 ByName#9795: Is this spies and stuff?
 ByName#9795: Harry who?
 Streak#8889: ben == harry confirmed
 ByName#9795: And the order of the missions is a message
 JamiesonH#0334: Heavens forbid
 ByName#9795: Maybe they're using my cipher
 JamiesonH#0334: fax
 Streak#8889: 4>5
 Streak#8889: it's a clue for the final cipher you have to use a new numbering system
 Streak#8889: Lmao
 JamiesonH#0334: counting is cringe
 Streak#8889: so many suspicious names 🤔🤔🤔
 Streak#8889: the next schools in like 7th
 JamiesonH#0334: ofc
 Streak#8889: Mr Johnson 4th ofc
 JamiesonH#0334: kegs domination tbf
 Streak#8889: Based
 Streak#8889: Cringe
 JamiesonH#0334: part b u first us second
 JamiesonH#0334: part a us third u like 10
 Streak#8889: oh how was last week's leaderboard?
 Streak#8889: or thx Jodie ig
 JamiesonH#0334: it took us like 8 mins for that so i'll reckon we'll be decently high up
 Streak#8889: thx Harry very helpful
 JamiesonH#0334: yeah haha
 Streak#8889: where tf does this come from
 Streak#8889: and what signs even point towards it
 JamiesonH#0334: cos the tip was cappin
 JamiesonH#0334: same haha
 JamiesonH#0334: part a
 Streak#8889: Which one?
 JamiesonH#0334: how did u figure it out
 Streak#8889: Fun though, they're about to get good
 Streak#8889: Decent challenge, got B pretty fast but cracked my head on A
 JamiesonH#0334: damn rip
 Streak#8889: Solved part B at like the 20min-half hour mark, Part A after like 40 minutes
 JamiesonH#0334: howd you find the challenges
 JamiesonH#0334: ripppp
 Streak#8889: Lmao got suuuper late cause of the SMC
 JamiesonH#0334: It was hard ;-;
 ByName#9795: Too slow
 ByName#9795: 15!?
 JamiesonH#0334: Took us 15 mins
 JamiesonH#0334: It was trickier today
 JamiesonH#0334: Shrey are you not doing it today :0
 JamiesonH#0334: Yassss
 Streak#8889: cb like coinbase?
 JamiesonH#0334: The cbpro API is swag cos it's pretty easy to use
 JamiesonH#0334: Yes
 Streak#8889: idk but that sounds cool
 Streak#8889: er
 JamiesonH#0334: Are u using the cbpro API
 JamiesonH#0334: Is Pedro the guy making the crypto trader bot
 Streak#8889: Hi 
 Streak#8889: Woo new member
 JamiesonH#0334:   why u never answer my question got me crying to sleep and shit
 Leavinq#1285: ok
 pedro1548#5722:
 JamiesonH#0334: Also what's ur team name
 JamiesonH#0334:  how long did it take ur team to do part b this week
 Streak#8889: what'd be cool
 Streak#8889: wonder what I should do with them
 Streak#8889: just asked lol
 Streak#8889: Simply built different
 JamiesonH#0334: How did you get all that access
 Taz#9211: let us know how good it id
 Taz#9211: nice
 JamiesonH#0334: Dubb
 Streak#8889: from now on all my thoughts are ai generated
 Streak#8889: i'll never have to write anything again
 Streak#8889: GPT-3, Codex and Copilot
 Streak#8889: the holy trinity
 JamiesonH#0334:   have you done it
 JamiesonH#0334: Part b was a nice surprise today haha
 JamiesonH#0334: never mind it doesnt work lol
 Taz#9211: cp?
 ron0studios#4591: anyone here do CP?
 ron0studios#4591: but idk too much
 ron0studios#4591: so catches errors and stuff
 ron0studios#4591: and also compiled
 JamiesonH#0334: its js but not dynamically typed
 JamiesonH#0334: isnt typescript some different
 Taz#9211: probably not? idk how typing your arrays would help compare them
 JamiesonH#0334: U can just solve it in js easily tho holdup
 JamiesonH#0334: Probs
 ron0studios#4591: can typescript  solve this problem ?
 ron0studios#4591: thats dumb
 ron0studios#4591: dang
 Taz#9211: it's a good one to have though
 Taz#9211: yeah
 JamiesonH#0334: ig its just a habit u have to build
 JamiesonH#0334: not even once ;-;
 JamiesonH#0334: i never do lol
 Taz#9211: helps avoid bugs
 Taz#9211: i pretty much always use ===
 Taz#9211: when you do '==' it'll try and convert them both to the same type, but '===' won't
 Taz#9211: yeah pretty much
 JamiesonH#0334: doesnt the extra = just check for same type
 JamiesonH#0334: false
 ron0studios#4591: whats the output for [1,1] === [1,1]
 JamiesonH#0334: probs cos its stupid
 JamiesonH#0334: idk why it does that lol
 ron0studios#4591: srry I've only used javascript for 2 or so weeks so i genuinely don't know a lot abt it
 ron0studios#4591: why?
 JamiesonH#0334: there must be a better way surely lol
 JamiesonH#0334: im using .every to check it now lol
 Taz#9211: lmaoo javascript can be painful sometimes
 JamiesonH#0334: was it johnson or sims u asked
 JamiesonH#0334: coool
 ron0studios#4591: so that's a yes in my book
 ron0studios#4591: now he said he's probably going to do it when he gets the invitation email
 ron0studios#4591: yh
 JamiesonH#0334: Didn't you ask and they said they'll consider it
 ron0studios#4591: mr johnson said he really wanted to do it this year
 ron0studios#4591: I think so
 JamiesonH#0334: Is kegs doing it
 JamiesonH#0334: The one I just sent was a Turing machine
 JamiesonH#0334: Oh nah the Haskell book and Turing machine books are different but both on his list
 Streak#8889: arent we all 😩
 Streak#8889: probs not tbh idk much haskelll but if i had to guess that aint it
 Streak#8889: was it the one you sent a pic of before?
 JamiesonH#0334: It was on Mr Johnson's reading list Im a shill for his validation
 JamiesonH#0334: I could probs talk a bit about Turing machines and stuff
 JamiesonH#0334: Haha I'll join in
 Streak#8889: but i could do an emotional live recital of the imitation game
 Streak#8889: well i'm not sure if i could quite prove that live
 Taz#9211: 😴
 Streak#8889: erm
 JamiesonH#0334: I'm reading this Turing machine book and it's pretty painful seeing all these proofs for the halting problem
 JamiesonH#0334: That sounds good acc , do u know much about him already
 JamiesonH#0334: The things I put myself through to try get into a good uni , actually having to read a book smh
 Streak#8889: ayo jamey if you ever wanna collab prism and compsoc i am down to waffle about turing for hours on end
 Taz#9211: it's peak
 Taz#9211: man saved us in WW2 and then they had him chemically castrated
 Taz#9211: the british government deeped alan turing being gay too much
 JamiesonH#0334: I like only Alan turning and turning machines cos they're gey
 Leavinq#1285: im gonna tell the gays that u prefer puters jamey :/
 Streak#8889: we are honoured
 Streak#8889: we have been chosen
 Streak#8889: the sacred day
 JamiesonH#0334: I shall actually be able to come sorry Prism tho 🤒
 JamiesonH#0334: So true
 JakeH#2364: fam allow me to do my BioSoc ting isn't it
 Streak#8889: gimme
 Streak#8889: new announcement: computing society has taxation
 JamiesonH#0334: But I have all the money 😈😼
 JamiesonH#0334: Society is p2w :(
 Streak#8889: p2w
 Streak#8889: lmao
 Simran#0812: Haha
 JamiesonH#0334: Literally spending £25 for u bro
 JamiesonH#0334: Mr Johnson please notice me
 JamiesonH#0334: I just did like 50 commands off stack overflow and one of them worked but idk which one
 JamiesonH#0334: Worst error ever
 JamiesonH#0334: Lmao
 Streak#8889: more accurate depiction
 Streak#8889: name your son error - ESLint msut be installed in order to run during builds: yarn add --dev eslint
 JamiesonH#0334: I'm naming my son javascript
 Streak#8889: must be bare confusing tryna do CS while being called jason
 ByName#9795: But everything is JSON so the data needs next to no processing
 ByName#9795: Unfortunately not
 JamiesonH#0334: Damn I won't be able to put in my yr12 a level computer science SQL skills
 ByName#9795: Once you've got a dB connection it's something like database.find(query), and the query is the same sort of JSON as how you would write to the db
 ByName#9795: It's a lot more like calling a bunch of functions on an object than using SQL statements from what I remember
 JamiesonH#0334: Oh cool
 ByName#9795: I'm using it as the database for my project, you don't need to do any relational stuff
 ByName#9795: Mongodb is fine
 JamiesonH#0334: i'll report back in a week
 JamiesonH#0334: oof
 Taz#9211: yh i've never used them either but from what ive seen they're a massive pain
 JamiesonH#0334: cant be too hard
 JamiesonH#0334: i have never done them before so hmmmm
 Taz#9211: databases 🖌️
 Taz#9211: ah mk
 JamiesonH#0334: hence why the "featured design" is just blank
 JamiesonH#0334: and ye i havent done that stuff yet cos i need to do monogDB shit
 Taz#9211: ooh ic
 JamiesonH#0334: it just lets u host sites for free but its the same guys who made next so its pretty good for it
 Taz#9211: and pressed submit
 Taz#9211: drew some random pixels
 Taz#9211: i went to builder
 JamiesonH#0334: where did u get that error taran
 Taz#9211: what actually is vercel
 Taz#9211: oh right
 JamiesonH#0334: nah i just got tired of coding and wanted to do the vercel stuff
 Taz#9211: is it meant to work
 JamiesonH#0334: but now its called game of life test cos i didnt expect it to work ;-;
 JamiesonH#0334: fr
 Taz#9211: the joy of programming
 Taz#9211: 😂
 JamiesonH#0334: bruh i just made another project on vercel exatcly the same and it worked
 JamiesonH#0334: this gave me a different error one sec and ill show
 JamiesonH#0334: i tried both those and no luck
 Taz#9211: or just do that yarn cmd it says
 Taz#9211: add eslint to your dependencies
 Taz#9211: yeah probably
 ByName#9795: Linting is normally just some thing for checking the code
 JamiesonH#0334: idk what ESlint is but whatever it does its ruining my life tbh
 JamiesonH#0334: but the builder is finished in a vvvvvv basic state rn
 JamiesonH#0334: also the sites not even finished cos i havent added all the database shit so itll probs break lol
 JamiesonH#0334: no cos vercel is cringe
 Karan.7519#8652: Is it up yet?
 JamiesonH#0334: vercel 😦
 JamiesonH#0334: nvm oof
 JamiesonH#0334: should be done now ol
 JamiesonH#0334: its taking ages ;-;-;
 Streak#8889: aahahahahhahahahahaehaheahhhahahhhahhahahhh
 JamiesonH#0334: got da new site to plug nyehehe
 JamiesonH#0334: Wish we had ads man 🐱
 Streak#8889: grindset
 Streak#8889: make ad money off of them
 JamiesonH#0334: Then it counts as a plug
 JamiesonH#0334: Nah not if I put the full URL and the GitHub repository URL
 Streak#8889: mf be like 'boutta plug my marriage to my parents'
 Streak#8889: bro that's just talking about your skills
 JamiesonH#0334: Boutta plug the website on my personal statement we out here
 ByName#9795: Unless it gets big pirate from YouTube
 Taz#9211: I'll make it the startup sound
 Taz#9211: omd
 JamiesonH#0334: My mum has the licensing rights to a 50 second jingle called "happy"
 JamiesonH#0334: I can make u some songs
 Taz#9211: we sail the seven seas
 Streak#8889: and by tomfoolery i mean piracy
 Streak#8889: we engage in a mild amount of tomfoolery
 Taz#9211: 🤫
 Taz#9211: I may be stealing from google
 Streak#8889: gcse compositions coming in clutch
 Streak#8889: collab with the music department
 Streak#8889: Lmao
 JamiesonH#0334: Bru
 Taz#9211: 🤐
 Taz#9211: hehehehehohoh
 JamiesonH#0334: Do u acc have music licensed to put on it or is there another way
 JamiesonH#0334: Oh cool
 Taz#9211: spotify/youtube music alternative
 JamiesonH#0334: What is it
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah that's smart lol
 Taz#9211: it's mainly my side project which I'm also doing as my cs project to avoid having to do two lmao
 Taz#9211: kinda
 Taz#9211: yeah
 JamiesonH#0334: Is that ur yr 12 computer science project
 Taz#9211: performant
 Taz#9211: and using react will probably make it more performance
 Taz#9211: I may rewrite my js project in react though cause my event model is super laggy
 Taz#9211: haven't gone too indepth yet though
 Taz#9211: and yeah I've done a little bit
 Taz#9211: ohh ic
 JamiesonH#0334: React is cool do u know it?
 JamiesonH#0334: But I havent got into the main stuff yet , most of what I've done is just the react shit
 JamiesonH#0334: Like when u route to a new page on ur website with href it doesn't have to send a request so it just does it instantly
 JamiesonH#0334: And other stuff
 JamiesonH#0334: Its a framework built on top of react that lets you do server side rendering
 Taz#9211: I feel like I've asked this before but what actually is it
 ByName#9795: I mean it does have tie ins with lots of other software and is on track for almost complete market domination, however on some older pcs it pegs CPU usage at 100%
 ByName#9795: Fax is the backup next time Facebook's DNS stops
 Streak#8889: fax and logik printers
 JamiesonH#0334: vanilla js versus bdsm fanatic js
 Streak#8889: exotic js hype
 ByName#9795: Bring back fax
 JamiesonH#0334: at least for the basic vanilla stuff
 JamiesonH#0334: i never did any courses or anything i kinda just picked it up
 JamiesonH#0334: yeah it is tbf
 Streak#8889: right
 Streak#8889: easy right
 Streak#8889: all i need to do is to learn js first
 Streak#8889: top tier argument tbh half convinced me
 JamiesonH#0334: idrk its just coool
 Streak#8889: pourqoui
 JamiesonH#0334: next js is sick every1 learn
 JamiesonH#0334: shut
 Streak#8889: Literally banned
 Streak#8889: fax? it's 2021 you stupid fool we use email now
 JamiesonH#0334: fax!!!!
 Streak#8889: light work
 Streak#8889: don't need to buy domains
 Streak#8889: saves trouble tbh
 Streak#8889: ez
 Streak#8889: why doesn't google just use local host
 JamiesonH#0334: run up the new site http://localhost:3000
 Streak#8889: the hype fall in 8 minutes
 Streak#8889: Lmao
 JamiesonH#0334: idk whats wrong ;-;
 JamiesonH#0334: damn.....
 Karan.7519#8652: Thanks 👍
 Taz#9211: think i got the general idea though
 Taz#9211: yeah lol i'll admit quite a bit of it went over my head
 ron0studios#4591: I'll probs only be able to reply by tomorrow just letting you know
 ron0studios#4591: lol
 ron0studios#4591: also forgot to ask for questions during the presentation
 ron0studios#4591: if anyone found anything confusing abt the priority queues presentation dont hesitate to ask me, im pretty sure there was some stuff in there I didnt explain in there well enough
 Streak#8889: karan hype
 ron0studios#4591: very well explained
 ron0studios#4591: Karan's presentation was epic
 JamiesonH#0334: poggg
 Streak#8889: next compsoc is at your house
 Streak#8889: pogger
 ron0studios#4591: oh lol
 JamiesonH#0334: i;ll do it then smh

 ron0studios#4591: Who's doing it next week?
 Karan.7519#8652: Sorry
 Karan.7519#8652: I've put them on here now
 Karan.7519#8652: Oh yh
 JamiesonH#0334: karan will u send the slides from yesterday
 JakeH#2364: If you want I can do my BioSoc one lol
 JamiesonH#0334: My man Karan
 Streak#8889: it's Karan this week
 JamiesonH#0334: Are u doing the presentation
 JamiesonH#0334: I'm not presenting sooooooo
 Streak#8889: So many ideas
 Streak#8889: stream it on discord
 Streak#8889: We'll just yell so you can hear us down the hallway
 Streak#8889: Lmao
 Streak#8889: might finally get a notice as well
 JamiesonH#0334: I'm mad I never get to go lol
 JamiesonH#0334: Oh sick lol
 Streak#8889: pretty hype
 Streak#8889: to make a tic tac toe ai
 Streak#8889: We're doing the Minimax Algorithm
 JamiesonH#0334: Do u know what it'll be on
 Streak#8889: But we'll try our best not to
 Streak#8889: We'll ping if we're gonna miss a week
 Streak#8889: Yep
 JamiesonH#0334: Is computing society on this week?
 Simran#0812: Email
 JamiesonH#0334: How do u know
 JamiesonH#0334: Oh sick
 Streak#8889: Mr Johnson might do the informatics olympiad
 JamiesonH#0334: Huh
 Streak#8889: guess rudrayan won
 JamiesonH#0334: yes ben, it now has the entire sematary discog
 ByName#9795: The website has improved significantly from what I've seen
 JamiesonH#0334: shrey can u see my sick setup
 JamiesonH#0334: grrrr
 Streak#8889: ~~cncm.netli...~~
 JamiesonH#0334: yeah......
 Streak#8889: plenty of websites out there
 JamiesonH#0334: by hand?
 JamiesonH#0334: how are u gonna solbve it lol
 Streak#8889: pro gamer
 JamiesonH#0334: and have my laptop out too
 JamiesonH#0334: i'll do study centre
 JamiesonH#0334: yet
 JamiesonH#0334: idk
 Streak#8889: are you using study centre computers or trying laptop again?
 Streak#8889: well not code
 JamiesonH#0334: have u got code for affine cipher decrypt
 Streak#8889: Creep
 JamiesonH#0334: -_-
 JamiesonH#0334: im looking at u lol
 JamiesonH#0334: yeah im in darwin
 Streak#8889: Do you have a free rn?
 JamiesonH#0334: my bad
 JamiesonH#0334: oh i thought you said you did lol
 Streak#8889: ~~thats later weeks~~
 Streak#8889: Imagine
 Streak#8889: nah no dcode here
 Streak#8889: Lost to another kegs wtf
 Leavinq#1285: faster than all existing solutions 😎
 JamiesonH#0334: Our site is faster than dcode anyway
 JamiesonH#0334: Using dcode tho so not valid
 JamiesonH#0334: Lol u guys came second well done
 Streak#8889: school trip
 JamiesonH#0334: yeee
 Streak#8889: @.everyone lets go to logans house
 Streak#8889: yes
 JamiesonH#0334: its round the corner
 JamiesonH#0334: logan is asleep , should i go to his house
 JamiesonH#0334: only to my friends who dont acctually care but at least theyll be impressed by my wazz talking
 Streak#8889: bigger number better person
 Streak#8889: mf wit da 609 followers
 JamiesonH#0334: but its not public lol im not that arrogant
 JamiesonH#0334: jamieh182
 Streak#8889: mr johnson in shambles
 Streak#8889: 200x faster unoptimised
 Streak#8889: whats your @ i'll follow you
 JamiesonH#0334: thats right, ya boi aint even done
 JamiesonH#0334: now to optimise it lol
 JamiesonH#0334: you dont get to hear my voice notes on instagram but im poppin off on the group chat
 JamiesonH#0334: ye honestly
 Streak#8889: nice
 Streak#8889: the price for the substitution speed appears to have been your sanity
 JamiesonH#0334: DUDE FAILED TO CONSIDER THE POEWR OF BEING THE BOI CUNNY LUVR
 Streak#8889: OP strats
 Streak#8889: inb4 jamie accidentally breaks RSA by reading papers
 JamiesonH#0334: dude FAILED TO CONSIDER MY FUCKINF STRATS
 JamiesonH#0334: literally made my own method better than the phd paper lol
 Streak#8889: when will  you return to society
 Streak#8889: thousands, hundreds, millions of times faster
 Streak#8889: when will it end
 Streak#8889: he's addicted to power and speed
 JamiesonH#0334: you know i be solving the substitution cipher 200 times quicker than mr johnson lol
 ron0studios#4591: also anyone doing BIO2022? (starting this november)
 ron0studios#4591: is it just until september next year or something?
 ron0studios#4591: when's the next foundation prize due date (approximately)?
 JamiesonH#0334: biphobic?
 Streak#8889: pangrams
 Leavinq#1285: phd noobheads callin it digrams rather than bigrams
 JamiesonH#0334: actually going brazy
 JamiesonH#0334: fair enough haha
 Leavinq#1285: game bad
 JamiesonH#0334: what happened there haha
 JamiesonH#0334: bruh
 Leavinq#1285: it sux
 JamiesonH#0334: why lul
 Leavinq#1285: we dont talk about duck game any more
 JamiesonH#0334: or duck game haha
 Leavinq#1285: i will do that then
 JamiesonH#0334: yes king
 Leavinq#1285: can i get a phd in osu
 Streak#8889: just get a PhD straightaway
 Streak#8889: CV moment
 Streak#8889: ez
 Streak#8889: then you go outside and touch grass
 JamiesonH#0334: lmao
 Streak#8889: it's called sys.exit()
 JamiesonH#0334: popping off because i improved on the algorithms from people with PHDs lol
 JamiesonH#0334: IM LITERALLY A PIONEER AT THIS SHIT
 JamiesonH#0334: BUT IT WILL BE FASTER
 JamiesonH#0334: cncm.netlify.app - now offering speeds up to 50 times quicker than mr johnson's site 🙂
 Professor Chaos#9143: Fashion statement.
 JamiesonH#0334: so sad
 JamiesonH#0334: i wish pyhton had a statement that let me get friends
 Karan.7519#8652: Nice
 JamiesonH#0334: LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOO HOLY SHITTTTTTTTT
 Leavinq#1285: 👍
 JamiesonH#0334: 👍
 Professor Chaos#9143: Python 3.10 has got switch statements.
 JamiesonH#0334: i think you should come to prism in room 35 on wednesday
 JamiesonH#0334: codesplash, word around town is you like femboys
 JamiesonH#0334: Not quite there but yeah , I know what I need to do now
 JamiesonH#0334: I think mine is close to perfect tbh
 JamiesonH#0334: Dw tho
 ron0studios#4591: oh
 JamiesonH#0334: I wasn't there lol
 ron0studios#4591: the one from the first presentation
 JamiesonH#0334: Which genetic algorithm
 ron0studios#4591: welcome...
 ron0studios#4591:
 Coloursplash#9680:
 Taz#9211: oh yh that'd be better
 ron0studios#4591: that owuld be better
 ron0studios#4591: or using live share on vs-code
 ron0studios#4591: i mean its more fun
 Taz#9211: considering how git works
 Taz#9211: wouldnt having multiple people work on one thing like that be kind of counter productive
 ron0studios#4591: yh we're using genetic algorithm
 JamiesonH#0334: Do u have a plan for ur substitution solver then
 JamiesonH#0334: Fairs
 ron0studios#4591: because I don't want to just do it all by myself in one go, it wouldnt be fun
 ron0studios#4591: Im trying to get a few people on board with the github before I start with that atm
 JamiesonH#0334: So rudrrayan , do u have a substitution cipher solver
 JamiesonH#0334: I think Ben solomons wants to walk to him about minecraft Dev stuff too
 JamiesonH#0334: Yes please
 ron0studios#4591: i know coloursplash, i could invite him here if you want btw
 Leavinq#1285: bruh
 ron0studios#4591: gomenesai
 Leavinq#1285: not good enough
 ron0studios#4591: oh srry i was offline for a bit
 Streak#8889: no spoilers ofc ofc
 JamiesonH#0334: sure unsent it
 JamiesonH#0334: oh hahah
 Streak#8889: o i meant like early next week
 JamiesonH#0334: powerpoint is sending
 JamiesonH#0334: there u go
 Streak#8889: after all the hype for it
 Streak#8889: o yea you have to show us your presentation
 JamiesonH#0334: femoboys galore
 JamiesonH#0334: come to prism bro
 Streak#8889: based coloursplash
 Leavinq#1285: he is
 JamiesonH#0334: im poppin off in VC
 Streak#8889: smfh
 Streak#8889: mf using thecypher voice instead of the lovely #voice-chat
 JamiesonH#0334: 
 JamiesonH#0334: i wanna speak to rudrrayan where he at
 JamiesonH#0334: yeah
 JamiesonH#0334: rudrrayan;s friend i think
 JamiesonH#0334: i like it tbf
 Taz#9211: what
 Streak#8889: gosh
 Streak#8889: even satirically liking js is a sin
 Taz#9211: i like javascript
 JamiesonH#0334: its called satire brooooooooooooo
 JamiesonH#0334: shush
 Streak#8889: lie detector test pls
 Streak#8889: likes javascript
 JamiesonH#0334: yep
 JamiesonH#0334: beefin up my github page to match the year 11s on here and get into the best unis
 Leavinq#1285: warwick does have an esports society 👀
 Leavinq#1285: theyve gotta accept me on gaming
 Streak#8889: throw out the rest of the statement
 Streak#8889: osu profile guarantees a job
 Leavinq#1285: also gonna link my osu profile and my youtube and my steam and my twitter and my instagram and my reddit
 Streak#8889: emphasis on 'jamie panel: hey'
 Leavinq#1285: yessir
 JamiesonH#0334: im linking our site in my personal statement tbh
 JamiesonH#0334: maybe hehe
 Streak#8889: namedrop in the ol cv idk
 JamiesonH#0334: they all just told me the same method of doing substitution ciphers
 JamiesonH#0334: i read like 5 different academic papers for no reason
 Streak#8889: mr johnson-endorsed insanity
 Streak#8889: before/after pics lmao
 Streak#8889: one week of cipher challenge and hes going insane
 JamiesonH#0334: mr johnson got me using arabic websites to pirate Proceedings of
Fourth International
Conference on Soft
Computing for
Problem Solving
SocProS 2014, Volume 2
 JamiesonH#0334: yep
 Leavinq#1285: jameys gone off the deep end
 JamiesonH#0334: just pages 2 and 3 really
 JamiesonH#0334: Could rudrrayan send his slides from today
 JamiesonH#0334: This is the most efficient way of solving a substitution cipher btw 👍
 Streak#8889: leaked info
 JamiesonH#0334: Rudrrayan are you presenting !
 JamiesonH#0334: I just want it on my personal statement tbh
 Leavinq#1285: lets u do server side rendering yh
 JamiesonH#0334: I've not really learnt much yet
 JamiesonH#0334: Something like that lol
 Taz#9211: like pre rendering and shit
 Taz#9211: ik it's smth to do with the backend but i know it also can do front end stuff as well i think?
 Taz#9211: oh ur learning next js? im still not entirely sure what it is tbh
 JamiesonH#0334: So I can let people save presets
 JamiesonH#0334: I'm just doing it as an excuse to learn next js
 Taz#9211: ooh interesting
 JamiesonH#0334: And if not I'll just recode it in js
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah but you can convert a lua game with love 2d to a html file
 Taz#9211: isn't it in lua?
 Streak#8889: tbf it does still let you do inputs with higher precision
 JamiesonH#0334: that zooms the whole page tho
 Streak#8889: ctrl ++
 Streak#8889: just zoom in chrome
 JamiesonH#0334: also his grid is small and has no zooming cringe
 JamiesonH#0334: we shall think
 Streak#8889: age of a cell = colour or something cool idk
 JamiesonH#0334: hmmm
 Streak#8889: make it pwetty pls
 JamiesonH#0334: am i gonna have to redo it in js now 😦
 Streak#8889: backend pogers
 JamiesonH#0334: i will add accounts where u login and can save everythig
 JamiesonH#0334: they let you save your game state by copying the link
 JamiesonH#0334: yessir
 Streak#8889: they'll rue the day they ever heard of conway's game of life
 Streak#8889: boi cunny luvr is on the case
 Streak#8889: ggs
 JamiesonH#0334: i'll make a better one
 JamiesonH#0334: cringe
 Streak#8889: idk what to say google top search result hits different
 JamiesonH#0334: see if u can find one haha
 Streak#8889: maybe we've stumbled upon the next google
 Streak#8889: would have thought that's like graphics 101
 JamiesonH#0334: i didnt look for very long tbf lol
 JamiesonH#0334: maybe i'll add that u can save ur presets
 Streak#8889: bit of a gap in the market innit
 Streak#8889: really?
 JamiesonH#0334: couldnt find any other sites where u can draw patterns and then run them
 JamiesonH#0334: gonna make it a website
 Streak#8889: oops you accidentally made adobe illustrator
 JamiesonH#0334: yeah haha
 Streak#8889: Like you tilt your screen for a hidden image
 Streak#8889: This feels like an optical illusion somehow
 JamiesonH#0334: i could just make them bigger but its not v sustainable
 JamiesonH#0334: yeah
 Streak#8889: and also prevent carpal tunnel
 Streak#8889: could click and drag to make life easier
 JamiesonH#0334: it was easy to make in lua but now i guess i'll just do clicking tiles to flip them then enter to start
 JamiesonH#0334: yeah i was doing lua stuff for coding club so just went with it lol
 Taz#9211: that works but probably harder to make patterns for
 Taz#9211: oh right nvm then
 Streak#8889: and make it a file or something
 Streak#8889: my simple ass was just thinking do a 0 for each cell and a 1 for each alive one
 Leavinq#1285: hes in lua not python
 Streak#8889: that's high tech
 Taz#9211:  ^
 Taz#9211: use an image then do smth with opencv/pillow to get the colour of each pixel
 JamiesonH#0334: hopefully theres just a preset stored as a 2d array or something
 Streak#8889: they're fun
 Streak#8889: then just use those
 Streak#8889: that one mf who made a clock
 Streak#8889: like shooters and whatnot
 Streak#8889: Yeah, if there's a way to store the configuration of the pattern, you can get interesting ones online
 JamiesonH#0334: like get them from online?
 JamiesonH#0334: and wdym load presets
 JamiesonH#0334: or am i just dumb
 Streak#8889: or you could just load presets idk
 JamiesonH#0334: bruh ur genius
 Streak#8889: dunno is there any ability to click
 JamiesonH#0334: how else am i supposed to do it ;-;
 Streak#8889: Ideal code
 Streak#8889: Lmao
 JamiesonH#0334: thats better than thid
 Streak#8889: shoutout to my man conway rip
 JamiesonH#0334: from scratch
 JamiesonH#0334: Thanks ben
 JamiesonH#0334: its just a 2d game for me but the same principles probably apply
 JamiesonH#0334: yeah that would make sense
 Streak#8889: seeing as it's like the biggest game and almost all procedural
 Streak#8889: I assume someone's made some analysis of like Minecraft's generation
 Streak#8889: i mean.. i'd assume you just find some noise you like, add whatever limits you want like oh i want this next to that, then just generate?
 JamiesonH#0334: yeah potentially from noise
 Streak#8889: like from noise? ~~but not really i've only got passing knowledge of it~~
 JamiesonH#0334: any1 here got any knowledge or experience of procedural generation for video games
 ron0studios#4591: itll soon be over then
 ron0studios#4591: wait till my man starts an advertising firm
 Streak#8889: advertising grindset
 Streak#8889: you won't be able to go 3 messages without me linking it
 Streak#8889: wait till i make a good website
 JamiesonH#0334: Nah it's true
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah bro
 ron0studios#4591: jk
 ron0studios#4591: obnoxious, yet consistent
 ron0studios#4591: i thought of learning it but startup apps are pretty dead at this point imo
 Streak#8889: mf doesn't miss a chance to flex
 ByName#9795: Yes, flutter is good
 ron0studios#4591: yh
 Streak#8889: equivalent to like react native and that iirc
 JamiesonH#0334: I just used my site to solve it lol
 JamiesonH#0334: Woahh
 ron0studios#4591: i think ben knows a lot about it
 ron0studios#4591: google's android developing thingy
 JamiesonH#0334: Idk what that is lol
 ron0studios#4591: time to learn flutter i guess lol
 ron0studios#4591: nice!
 JamiesonH#0334: It took me a couple minutes cos I had to do it onmy phone lol
 JamiesonH#0334: Sounds good
 ron0studios#4591: it was pretty fun to make, especially with friends
 ron0studios#4591: we plan to adjust to simple whole word checking for small text, trigrams for a bit longer text and bigrams for even longer text
 ron0studios#4591: we made our own version of the automatic cipher cracker and it worked reaally well!
 ron0studios#4591: we did it in 3 minutes lmao
 JamiesonH#0334: Cipher challenege
 JamiesonH#0334: Rudrrayan did u get the first challenege done
 ron0studios#4591: dayum
 JamiesonH#0334: need fens updated html code
 JamiesonH#0334: it uses a version of html and css files that are completley out of sync
 JamiesonH#0334: is fen asleep
 Leavinq#1285: so true bestie ❤
 JamiesonH#0334: yooooooooooo the new website changes look sickkkk
 JamiesonH#0334: im mixing it up
 Streak#8889: after reading 'hello i like computer science here is my github look i know python' 50 times they'll be glad for some boi cunny luvr in their life
 Streak#8889: you can be the light of their day
 JamiesonH#0334: this brings me great pleasure
 Streak#8889: we have to beat you so he can read normal names
 Streak#8889: thecypher protecting mr carter's reputation
 JamiesonH#0334: if we win someone at trinity college cambridge will have to read the name cncm / boi cunny luvr
 JamiesonH#0334: yeah
 Leavinq#1285: only want to win so I can get addressed in assembly as beast
 Streak#8889: can you at least add your name in brackets dear god
 Leavinq#1285: I assume I can also use my official cipher challenge name
 Streak#8889: happy days
 Taz#9211: wholesome c:
 JamiesonH#0334: thx my mum came up with it
 Streak#8889: 'hi logan'
'hi cncm forward slash boi cunny luv r'
 JamiesonH#0334: thats what ever1 calls me at school
 Taz#9211: i rate your name
 Streak#8889: would you like us to just call you by that from now on
 Streak#8889: is that recognisable
 Streak#8889: erm
 Streak#8889: Xx\_\_jamieeee\_\_xXx
 Taz#9211: truly a modern sherlock holmes
 JamiesonH#0334: can i change my name to my cipher challenege official name
 Streak#8889: hot takes ik
 Streak#8889: imma assume arnavigator is called arnav
 Streak#8889: speaking of,  same
 Taz#9211: i add everyone's name as a discord note
 Streak#8889: but can you change your nickname so we know who tf is who
 Streak#8889: oh woops forgot i even made the rule about using actual names
 JamiesonH#0334: putting pressure on fen rn
 Leavinq#1285: yes
 Taz#9211:  is this logan
 JamiesonH#0334: smh
 Leavinq#1285: been waiting for him to push all night
 Streak#8889: imagine taking 5 minutes to solve it couldn't be me
wtf is a connection speed
 JamiesonH#0334: and we cant merge our branches because he needs to push his code or itll cause a huge merge conflict
 Taz#9211: rip
 Streak#8889: flexes in town
 Simran#0812: N fun
 Simran#0812: Yeah, I did the first one it was soo easy
 JamiesonH#0334: fenwick is supposed to be on that but hes out
 Streak#8889: but for now it's easy enough that we might as well do it ourselves
 Streak#8889: once it gets difficult we all work together and try to find the answer
 Leavinq#1285: (now infinitely more based than Mr Johnson)
 Taz#9211: now all you need to do is make your website look as good as his does
 Streak#8889: nah but we might as well all do it for fun
 JamiesonH#0334: (now solving your substitution ciphers at speeds up to 15x quicker than those on mr johnsons site)
 Simran#0812: We r  supposed to do it separately?
 Streak#8889: probs should ping or something
 Streak#8889: Simran did you get to give it a go?
 JamiesonH#0334: cringe dcode user versus based cncm user
 Taz#9211: ok calm, it was caesar right?
 Streak#8889: Imagine
 Streak#8889: yeah
 Taz#9211:  i assume u guys already did it
 Streak#8889: fast enough for me
 Streak#8889: just used dcode lol
 Taz#9211: oh i forgot the challenge released today
 JamiesonH#0334: what did u use to do it? did u already have code for it
 JamiesonH#0334: hehe
 Streak#8889: ctrl+c ctrl+v
 Streak#8889: i mean
 Streak#8889: i think the people who had a free 5th did it
 Streak#8889: Lol
 JamiesonH#0334: has everyone here done it?
 JamiesonH#0334: still salty about todays challenege not loading on my laptop and having to decrypt it on my phone -_-
 JamiesonH#0334: 21 minutes ssss'
 ByName#9795: Time to download twitch to my windows 11 computer
 JamiesonH#0334: Yep
 Streak#8889: if i give you my credit card details will you not expose my twitch
 JamiesonH#0334: Guys don't worry the twitch thing was me ,reply to this message to signal that you don't want your details sold :)
 JamiesonH#0334: Damn
 ron0studios#4591: an effective cleaner
 ron0studios#4591: big O of negative N
 JamiesonH#0334: Hell yeah
 Streak#8889: hit em with that o(0) time
 JamiesonH#0334: I just made some changes to my site to make everything 60% faster 😎
 JamiesonH#0334: Cool
 Streak#8889: so messages don't get lost in chatting
 JamiesonH#0334: Ahhh
 Streak#8889:  for everything anyways idc that much
 JamiesonH#0334: Wdym haha
 Streak#8889: locking it for a lil more focus lol
 JamiesonH#0334: Lol rip
 ron0studios#4591: where'd thecypher-chat go?
 JamiesonH#0334: Could I do something on coc n ballz
 Streak#8889: ~~after I'm done eating lol~~
 Streak#8889: we'll see what we can do
 Streak#8889: Er we're a bit backlogged on presentations atm
 ron0studios#4591: bcs ill be free tomorrow lunchtime
 ron0studios#4591: could i do something on MST's and linear sorting?
 Streak#8889: but specifically DFS cuz I don't have all day
 Streak#8889: Search algorithms
 Streak#8889: DFS
 JamiesonH#0334: What's it on
 JamiesonH#0334: No prism so I can acc go
 Streak#8889: ~~should send out a notice at form as well~~
 Streak#8889: I'll post in 
 Streak#8889: start of lunch in cr4
 Streak#8889: tomorrow
 Leavinq#1285: whens computing society lol
 Leavinq#1285: not happy >:((((((
 Streak#8889: coming in fires blazing
 Streak#8889: There you go
 Leavinq#1285: am member
 Streak#8889: Lmao
 Leavinq#1285: not member
 Leavinq#1285: i cant see
 Leavinq#1285: bloomin fumin i am
 JamiesonH#0334: 
 JamiesonH#0334: Lmao
 Leavinq#1285: where is the dirty website stealer >:((((
 JamiesonH#0334:
 Leavinq#1285:
 JamiesonH#0334: Also nmeade does what summoning salt does but every month , more about the driving than the story
 JamiesonH#0334: His mkwii ultra shortcuts are sick
 JamiesonH#0334: Summoning salt probs
 Streak#8889: and mathias
 Streak#8889: about like mk64 runs
 Streak#8889: all ik is that one video that went wild
 Streak#8889: mario kart speedrun poggers
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah pretty much
 JamiesonH#0334: The wr scene is still going strong
 Streak#8889: fanmade tracks either gonna be like god tier or spaghetti
 Streak#8889: bit much to troll on a game that came out in the 2000s
 JamiesonH#0334: There's custom fan made tracks too which are really good if u don't mind the sometimes limited graphics
 Streak#8889: i see
 Streak#8889: oh hax
 JamiesonH#0334: And using hacks
 JamiesonH#0334: Not racing and just trying to hit people with items at the start line lol
 Streak#8889: literally how do you be toxic it's mario kart
 Streak#8889: how do you get banned from mkwii
 Streak#8889: hoes mad
 Streak#8889: 😬
 JamiesonH#0334: The down spike at the end is bcos someone who got banned ddosed it and made online unplayable
 Streak#8889: on the mkwii grind 😤
 JamiesonH#0334: 3000 people log onto ctgp , the biggest mkwii mod , per day
 Streak#8889: what in like the world
 JamiesonH#0334: There's 23 people online rn
 JamiesonH#0334: Nah people still play hold up
 Streak#8889: does it take ages to find other players or do people still play?
 JamiesonH#0334: But the modded servers are better than the old ones cos of better anticheat and stuff
 JamiesonH#0334: Probs all
 Streak#8889: or just like mario kart
 Streak#8889: did they do that for all wii games
 JamiesonH#0334: Cos Nintendo shut down the server's so u need a mod to play online
 JamiesonH#0334: Mkwii moding is quite a big scene
 Streak#8889: who tf out here modding their wii
 JamiesonH#0334: U can in mkwii with mods lol
 Streak#8889: you can play as Link in mk8
 JamiesonH#0334: Like what -_-
 Streak#8889: and hear me out
 Streak#8889: old and all
 Streak#8889: mkwii is like
 JamiesonH#0334: Obvs switch is a better console I just don't like mk8
 JamiesonH#0334: And I will die on that hill btw
 JamiesonH#0334: Wii is better than 8
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah
 Streak#8889: do you have a Switch?
 Streak#8889: w i i
 Streak#8889: like
 Streak#8889: how do i respond to that
 Streak#8889: wii
 Streak#8889: living in denial
 JamiesonH#0334: I play Mario kart Wii a lot
 JamiesonH#0334: I don't play that many games tbh
 Streak#8889: but there's other games which are actually like a whole new beast
 Streak#8889: since master mode isn't that hype
 Streak#8889: like in zelda i'd rather speedrun
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah
 JamiesonH#0334: Cos then u just rush all the boring parts and get to the bosses quickly
 Streak#8889: feel like it depends on the game
 JamiesonH#0334: I prefer doing Ng plus to speedruns tbh
 Streak#8889: absolute torture first
 Streak#8889: but like
 Streak#8889: and then it's absolute joy
 Streak#8889: i've heard that their absolute torture until it just clicks
 JamiesonH#0334: Watcher Knights suck tbh
 Streak#8889: not ideal
 Streak#8889: i'd spend like 3 hours on Watcher Knights each time
 JamiesonH#0334: That's the hard part lol
 Streak#8889: good at the game
 Streak#8889: like
 Streak#8889: i'd have to be
 Streak#8889: but like
 Streak#8889: and i considered trying the HK speedrun
 Streak#8889: Celeste got me into speedrunning cuz it's like the best speedrun game of all time
 Streak#8889: speedrunner over here
 JamiesonH#0334: At least when it first came out and I played it all day long lol
 JamiesonH#0334: Cos that's ez and I finish it in like an hour and a half no death
 JamiesonH#0334: I can't remember for sure but I do NG plus a lot lol
 Streak#8889: wtf
 Streak#8889: u ok my guy
 JamiesonH#0334: I've beat it like 15 times plus or something
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah
 Streak#8889: forget house chess where's house sekiro appreciation
 JamiesonH#0334: Any sekiro fan is a legend so respect
 JamiesonH#0334: Bet I love it more than him 😎
 JamiesonH#0334: Nah
 Streak#8889: dyk ki?
 JamiesonH#0334: Who's this guy
 Streak#8889: er him too
 Streak#8889: so i've heard nothing but good vibes
 JamiesonH#0334: Joe?
 Streak#8889: never played sekiro but a dude ik loves it to death
 JamiesonH#0334: I've only played hollow knight of those 3
 Streak#8889: rough times honestly
 Streak#8889: and got absolutely destroyed in all 3 at once
 Streak#8889: i got into Hollow Knight, Celeste and Hades at fairlyish the same time
 JamiesonH#0334: Haha that's why Im max level on sekiro
 Streak#8889: playing superhard games just to feel something
 JamiesonH#0334: The only games i've acc played through multiple times is all the soulsbourne games so that is what I like
 Streak#8889: good to know
 Streak#8889: if you like pain its fun
 JamiesonH#0334: Depends if u like dying over and over again
 JamiesonH#0334: Hmmmm
 Streak#8889: is it fun or like """"fun"""" though
 JamiesonH#0334: But it was fun at least lol
 JamiesonH#0334: Well I say that but it took me like 4 hours
 JamiesonH#0334: Path of pain is fine
 Streak#8889: love it
 Streak#8889: yeah so much fun
 Streak#8889: light work
 Streak#8889: i beat celeste
 JamiesonH#0334: Such a good boss
 Streak#8889: still got Path of Pain in the bank but that can't be _that_ hard
 JamiesonH#0334: I did nkg tho
 Streak#8889: low key i don't wanna finish
 Streak#8889: the smart route
 JamiesonH#0334: I beat everything except the pantheons lol , didn't even try that shit
 Streak#8889: might still be fighting NKG a little bit
 JamiesonH#0334: shrey how good r u at hollow knight
 JamiesonH#0334: haha
 Streak#8889: VAR
 JamiesonH#0334: investigation pending
 JamiesonH#0334: it is , isnt it ;-;
 JamiesonH#0334: lol is it cos i like boys
 ron0studios#4591: cya
 ron0studios#4591: gotta sk'daddle
 JamiesonH#0334: i can say it cos gey ish
 ron0studios#4591: ohhh
 JamiesonH#0334: koxf@gs
 ron0studios#4591: kegs + oxford + kegs = k**oxf**egs
 JamiesonH#0334: it is
 ron0studios#4591: why does this sound like a slur
 ron0studios#4591: how many koxfegs and kamfegs?
 JamiesonH#0334: so u get a decent chance of getting hired by the company u did it for , and theyre good companies too
 ron0studios#4591: koxfegs
 JamiesonH#0334: yeah imperial has good industrial ties plus u do a year in industry as ur third year for their cs course
 Streak#8889: mf went kegs to Oxford to kegs again lmao
 Streak#8889: Industrial partnerships n stuff
 ron0studios#4591: *cough* mr maxwell-lyte
 Streak#8889: honestly depends a lot on opportunities
 ron0studios#4591: 😬
 Streak#8889: if you have like Oxford on your CV you guaranteed getting a job anyways
 JamiesonH#0334: imperial is better for average pay after leaving uni anyway lol
 JamiesonH#0334: and no cos i cant get in cos they require further maths
 ron0studios#4591: lol
 ron0studios#4591: and what looks better on your CV
 ron0studios#4591: its only tiny differences
 JamiesonH#0334: yeah haha
 Streak#8889: when they're that good what even is better tbh
 ron0studios#4591: mainly UCL
 ron0studios#4591: so no oxbridge?
 ron0studios#4591: but mit is better for compsci
 JamiesonH#0334: im only applying to london unis
 ron0studios#4591: oxbridge actually gets generally higher scores than mit
 ron0studios#4591: + ill probably end up being able to work at mountain view or smth like that
 JamiesonH#0334: imperial is like top 10 or something , its 7th overall so i shall suffice with that lul
 ron0studios#4591: pretty sure
 JamiesonH#0334: thats like best in world for cs right
 ron0studios#4591: thanks :D.
 JamiesonH#0334: thats a good aspiration to have
 JamiesonH#0334: if u wanna go MIT go for it boss
 JamiesonH#0334: haha
 ron0studios#4591: keep that capitalism blood flowing
 ron0studios#4591: ivy leagues are too focused on independance and sports anyways
 JamiesonH#0334: cool
 ron0studios#4591: atleast thats what oxbridge does
 ron0studios#4591: they focus on small groups of 3-4 with direct teaching from a professor
 ron0studios#4591: what i like more is that they dont even do lecture rooms that often
 ron0studios#4591: i like the lecture rooms there
 ron0studios#4591: UK universities are stylish imo
 JamiesonH#0334: and imperial is a great uni anyway
 JamiesonH#0334: i would consider it but i wanna live in london anyway
 JamiesonH#0334: oh cool
 JamiesonH#0334: oh lol
 ron0studios#4591: most universities are increasing international student counts so that they can get more money, since they ran out during covid
 ron0studios#4591: its going to increase though because of covid
 ron0studios#4591: they accept around 50-40 ppl for that
 ron0studios#4591: definitely
 JamiesonH#0334: probs lower for international tho
 JamiesonH#0334: its 7.3% acceptance rate which is bad but as far as comsci goes not terrible lol
 ron0studios#4591: its just having that **passion**
 ron0studios#4591: its not about being smart per se
 ron0studios#4591: some ppl from our school end up international, but its mostly those who would die for their subject
 JamiesonH#0334: i assume youd basically need all a stars to get in lol
 JamiesonH#0334: thatd be sick tho , i have no clue how you apply for an american uni haha
 ron0studios#4591: its super useful for uni compsci though
 JamiesonH#0334: u dont need any maths for a level comsci tbh '
 ron0studios#4591: im thinking MIT but thats probably too big of an aspiration. especially in terms of costs
 JamiesonH#0334: haha dw
 ron0studios#4591: got confuzzled
 ron0studios#4591: oh ok
 JamiesonH#0334: cs
 ron0studios#4591: what are you going for then?
 JamiesonH#0334: for imperial its just v useful  for their entrance exams which is where i wanna go
 ron0studios#4591: oh cs isnt you're number one pick?
 JamiesonH#0334: only oxford and cambridge require it
 JamiesonH#0334: but my number one pick doesnt *necessarily* need it
 ron0studios#4591: i mean its    m a t h e m a t i c s
 JamiesonH#0334: cant remember tbh it was a while ago
 ron0studios#4591: why didnt you?
 JamiesonH#0334: didnt want to at the time , regret it now
 ron0studios#4591: why not?
 JamiesonH#0334: i didnt ;-;
 ron0studios#4591: yh yh ofc
 JamiesonH#0334: for comsci just do further maths if u wanna get into a top tier uni
 ron0studios#4591: i might pick a science for a level idk if i want to though
 ron0studios#4591: yh yh
 JamiesonH#0334: yeah theres lots of circuits in both
 ron0studios#4591: that makes sense ig
 JamiesonH#0334: electronics goes much better with physics
 JamiesonH#0334: yeah
 ron0studios#4591: with electronics?
 JamiesonH#0334: its pretty miniscule tbh
 JamiesonH#0334: theres a teeeeeeeny bit of crossover for comsci a level
 ron0studios#4591: i mean it should
 ron0studios#4591: yh apparantly it goes well with cs
 JamiesonH#0334: idk sorry
 JamiesonH#0334: and i watched a bunch of craig n dave for a week before and got 90%
 ron0studios#4591: i skipped out on electronics for gcse, can i still do it for a level?
 ron0studios#4591: yikes
 JamiesonH#0334: the exam results speak for themselves tbh , like everyone got predicted A star except 2 guys
 ron0studios#4591: apart from further maths, what goes well with cs?
 ron0studios#4591: nice
 ron0studios#4591: epic?
 JamiesonH#0334: youll probs find a level a cake walk lol
 JamiesonH#0334: ebic
 ron0studios#4591: my first language was c++
 JamiesonH#0334: and u probs wont struggle with the coding side of it , how good are u with object oriented
 JamiesonH#0334: a level theory is really easy in general tbh
 JamiesonH#0334: It was boring but you get through everything quickly
 JamiesonH#0334: I challenge you to enjoy that lesson
 ron0studios#4591: especially for companies in faang and stuff
 ron0studios#4591: I mean i'd still enjoy it ngl
 ron0studios#4591: im assuming its boring as
 ron0studios#4591: thank god
 JamiesonH#0334: Just one lesson lol dw
 ron0studios#4591: how long is that part
 ron0studios#4591: oh god software development cycles
 JamiesonH#0334: So far we've done software development cycles, encryption and hashing and networks / protocols
 JamiesonH#0334: We mainly do our coursework plus a little bit of theory
 ron0studios#4591: just project work and applications?
 ron0studios#4591: what do you do in year 13?
 JamiesonH#0334: It's not that interesting tbh
 ron0studios#4591: I havent actually looked at the details for page rank yet idk why
 JamiesonH#0334: And you only do it yr 12 not 13
 JamiesonH#0334: That's it I think
 JamiesonH#0334: We do list search and sort , v basic ones for a few of the main data structures, shortest path algorithms and page rank
 JamiesonH#0334: Probs nothing you haven't done
 ron0studios#4591: how far do you guys go with algorithms at a level?
 JamiesonH#0334: As part of cipher challenge prep
 ron0studios#4591: ah i see
 JamiesonH#0334: Cipher
 JamiesonH#0334: Just a better method of decrpyting a vigenere ciphee
 ron0studios#4591: or was the initial implementation just garbage?
 ron0studios#4591: whas it dynamic programming or smth?
 ron0studios#4591: oooo...
 JamiesonH#0334: Wait nvm It was polynomial to linear
 ron0studios#4591: nice
 JamiesonH#0334: fair enough , i popped off the other day when i turned a polynomail time algorithm to quadratic
 ron0studios#4591: graph algorithms, DS, and dynamic programming are one of my main interests
 ron0studios#4591: and making things faster than they already need to be
 ron0studios#4591: i love time complexity
 JamiesonH#0334: you will enjoy a level com sci with johnson
 JamiesonH#0334: this man going crazy for sort algs
 ron0studios#4591: I implemented this beast yesterday and it is awesome. its **L  I  N  E  A  R      T  I  M  E**
 ron0studios#4591: look at quick sort and then look at **counting sort**
 ron0studios#4591: Watch from 1:18
 Streak#8889: never done one of those before
 Streak#8889: i did a comedy speech
 Streak#8889: it was fun anyways
 Streak#8889: the other kegs team won and they didn't wanna simp for one school ~~copium copium~~
 Streak#8889: basically did innit
 JamiesonH#0334: tehy stole the trophy from his own hands
 ron0studios#4591: robbed?
 Streak#8889: got robbed last year so might try again
 Streak#8889: maybe when the actual esu competition starts
 Streak#8889: ah can't do that either
 ron0studios#4591: nah its monday
 Streak#8889: literal heresy
 JakeH#2364: nvm i muted it
 Streak#8889: also isn't debating at the same time as compsoc
 Streak#8889: jacob
 Streak#8889: join the conversation
 JakeH#2364: oi ppl stop texting the notification thing's annyoing me
 ron0studios#4591: reminds me of OOP
 ron0studios#4591: i like the **hierarchy**
 ron0studios#4591: its fun
 Streak#8889: i don't think there's like a deep overarching topic here that needs to be preserved
 Streak#8889: dw so much about threads
 ron0studios#4591: anyone doing debating?
 JakeH#2364: Kk
 Streak#8889: tomorrow innit
 JakeH#2364: I'll add some if u give perms 🤷‍♂️
 JakeH#2364: 😂
 Streak#8889: ayo how do we not have an emoji of you there's so many good pics
 Streak#8889: you can get it later if you're a good boy
 Streak#8889: are you mf elvis with all these perms
 JakeH#2364: Allow it son
 JakeH#2364: Why u remove my perms
 Streak#8889: bro
 JakeH#2364: Fam
 JakeH#2364: Tomorrow tho coz my laptop is all the way on my desk which is literally hundreds of cm away so I will be unable to make the journey atm
 Streak#8889: yeah you better beg for mercy
 JakeH#2364: Merci
 JakeH#2364: Coz there aren't enough
 Streak#8889:  how do you want more emojis
 JakeH#2364: discord multithreading harder than my pc let's gooo
 ron0studios#4591: test
 Streak#8889: \<3 jake
 Streak#8889: wake up babe new emojis just dropped
 JakeH#2364: 😂
 Streak#8889: mf productive people 😭
 JakeH#2364: I already handed mine in so I can't send sorry
 JakeH#2364: yh
 Streak#8889: also for physics do we just have to finish the pag sheet
 Streak#8889: aight
 JakeH#2364: 1 sec
 JakeH#2364: I will now ig
 JakeH#2364: no lmao
 Streak#8889: did you add your emojis btw
 JakeH#2364: lol
 JakeH#2364: rules police
 Streak#8889: honourary mod
 Streak#8889: look at this
 Streak#8889: jakeh is typing
 JakeH#2364: can   and   change ur nicknames pls (real names only as stated in the rules)
 ron0studios#4591: ok!
 Streak#8889: just shout if you want channels 🤷‍♂️
 Streak#8889: free to do whatever you like
 Streak#8889: so y'know
 Streak#8889: it's more casual and all
 Streak#8889: it's not a team comp right?
 ron0studios#4591: maybe on VC during the contest
 ron0studios#4591: Since compsoc is more leaned on the theory of computer science, maybe we could get more people in on kickstart
 ron0studios#4591: ok i thought it wasnt supposed to do that
 ron0studios#4591: oh
 Streak#8889: Yeah  is open for anyone to post
 Streak#8889: Honestly i tried joining kickstart but missed everyone challenge lmao
 ron0studios#4591: I can still type in  btw i think
 Streak#8889: but hackathons is like conversations and stuff about joining whatever
 Streak#8889: the latter's mostly like single post announcements
 Streak#8889: Sure,  is more free and unrestricted than like  or something
 ron0studios#4591: is that where its supposed to go?
 ron0studios#4591: I included a link to google kickstart on the  chat
 ron0studios#4591: i see
 Streak#8889: didn't bother much with them
 Streak#8889: so eh
 Streak#8889: and we're not official anyways
 Streak#8889: they're a bit odd
 ron0studios#4591: Apparantly they're like official reddits for school
 ron0studios#4591: How do student hubs work on discord?
 Taz#9211: it's pretty sick
 Taz#9211: there's also this thing called web assembly that lets u run compiled stuff like rust in the browser
 ByName#9795: Last year I made a very basic web app using it and it was alright but browser support was terrible
 ByName#9795: They have been working in it for over a year
 ron0studios#4591: after all, its **google**
 ron0studios#4591: but that should sort itself out very soon
 ron0studios#4591: web support is apparantly still very limited at the moment
 ron0studios#4591: lol
 Streak#8889: yo the macs older than some year 7s
 ByName#9795: desktop app is being done in JavaFX as I need to be able to run it on a 13 year old mac
 ByName#9795: and maybe web
 ByName#9795: android & ios
 ron0studios#4591: nah
 ron0studios#4591: unless ur using flutter for desktop and web???
 ron0studios#4591: lol android
 Streak#8889: Lmao my notif only showed the second message but I could tell it was josh
 Taz#9211: he’s doing political polls analysis to work out who’s gonna win an election or smth like that
 Taz#9211: josh
 JakeH#2364: Who?
 Streak#8889: yo
 Taz#9211: yo
 Simran#0812:
 Taz#9211: because it's good for statistical analysis or smth like that
 Taz#9211: one guy in my class is using R
 JamiesonH#0334: Py
 JamiesonH#0334: Ben do u know anyone not using java , js or pu
 ByName#9795: I'm using java, dart and JavaScript
 ByName#9795: Try Fortran
 JamiesonH#0334: And it's better to do something u already know for coursework
 JamiesonH#0334: Don't know Godot
 JamiesonH#0334: I'm using lua cos I already now how to use it
 JamiesonH#0334: Nice
 ron0studios#4591: it has a much simpler (and more powerful) scripting language. Its FOSS. it gets developed way faster and is optimized for 2d
 ron0studios#4591: I personally enjoy godot engine much more
 ron0studios#4591: unity's pretty common
 ron0studios#4591: yh
 JamiesonH#0334: Or unity
 JamiesonH#0334: Apart from Ben who idk what language he's using, every1 uses python java or JavaScript basically
 JamiesonH#0334: Me using lua and love 2d engine is like one of the most uncommon
 JamiesonH#0334: Game
 ron0studios#4591: or a website
 ron0studios#4591: im assuming making a game is the most common project
 JamiesonH#0334: Almost everyone uses the basic most common ones
 JamiesonH#0334: Ehh not really
 ron0studios#4591: and maby epq and other stuff ig
 ron0studios#4591: yh
 ron0studios#4591: using really old and uncommon languages
 JamiesonH#0334: You mean for our coursework?
 JamiesonH#0334: Wdym outdated ?
 ron0studios#4591: what's probably the most boring or unexciting project?
whats the most common project?
 ron0studios#4591: curious bcs Ill be doing a levels next year
 ron0studios#4591: anyone in the a levels class using really outdated stuff?
 ByName#9795: Yes
 JamiesonH#0334: Best Minecraft server
 Taz#9211: ah ic
 ByName#9795: Minecraft server
 ByName#9795: Craftcadia
 Taz#9211: btw  what is cadia?
 ByName#9795: Essentials stores ip addresses in all the player data files
 JamiesonH#0334: Sussy
 ByName#9795: At least I did, it might have been deleted
 Streak#8889: _turns on vpn_
 Streak#8889: 👀
 ByName#9795: Yes
 JamiesonH#0334: Do u have mine lol
 JamiesonH#0334: Bruh
 ByName#9795: One of the things we used on cadia logs the ip of each request
 ByName#9795: Some log IP addresses
 JamiesonH#0334: Im not smart sorry lol
 JamiesonH#0334: No clue lol
 Taz#9211: not sure what it uses for backend
 Taz#9211: i assume it just serves the html js and css files when requested
 ByName#9795: What webserver does netlify use?
 ByName#9795: I have lots of people's IP addresses
 Taz#9211: hahaha
 JamiesonH#0334: I just wanna do it so I can figure out Mr Sims's IP
 ByName#9795: pegasus 2.0
 JamiesonH#0334: Might not even do it but yeah can't think of anything else rn
 ByName#9795: Full data index on all attendees
 JamiesonH#0334: Honestly don't know
 Taz#9211: are u gonna add posts and comments and stuff?
 Taz#9211: what sort of database stuff would a prism website need though?
 JamiesonH#0334: Thanks
 JamiesonH#0334: Prism doesn't really need a website but it's a good project to learn it for
 JamiesonH#0334: Wanna use it for prism website
 JamiesonH#0334: That'd be sick
 Taz#9211: i think there's a thing called next.js that's good if you're doing react frontend with node.js backend or smth like that?
 Taz#9211: yeah, im familiar with it but havent used it for any projects yet
 JamiesonH#0334: AI trader was fun , using coinbase pro API but I never set it loose on real money cos my ai skills are v basic
 JamiesonH#0334: Only those whove done hypothesis testing will get it
 JamiesonH#0334: 100%
 ByName#9795: H0: p=?
 JamiesonH#0334: Do u know react ?
 JamiesonH#0334: Got bored of trying to after like 10 mins and moved on
 JamiesonH#0334: Tbh I kinda looked at PHP couldn't install it so quit lol
 JamiesonH#0334: Oki thanksssss
 Taz#9211: there's a bunch of javascript backends using node.js, there's ruby/ruby on rails, and also python backends
 JamiesonH#0334: What's better ?
 Taz#9211: php is dead af i'd learn smth more modern
 JamiesonH#0334: Also wanna learn ocaml
 JamiesonH#0334: Those are the main ones
 JamiesonH#0334: Cipher challenge website , AI crypto trader thing but I kinda stopped that now , comsci coursework I'm making a platformer game, learning react js for prism website , Minecraft server I mentioned and also wanna learn PHP and MySQL
 Streak#8889: what projects you got going?
 Taz#9211: ouch
 Streak#8889: 💀
 JamiesonH#0334: Hence why my grades fell from predicted four a stars last summer to 53% in physics unit test:/
 JamiesonH#0334: Lol I've basically stopped doing any work for school and just do personal project shit now
 Streak#8889: well you have a switch now so get grinding 😤 what are a levels compared to smash
 Streak#8889: never knew
 Streak#8889: oh is elite smash actually top 1%
 JamiesonH#0334: It tells u in-game , it's called elite smash
 Streak#8889: there's a top 1%? how do you know?
 JamiesonH#0334: My gf is top 1% for palu and she thrashes me every time so probs not that good lol
 JamiesonH#0334: I don't know what sort of gsp I'd be at lol
 JamiesonH#0334: Terry is fun
 JamiesonH#0334: Ahh Oki
 Streak#8889: other people on the bus had smash so i never really bothered with it
 Streak#8889: didn't get NSO either lol
 JamiesonH#0334: What's ur gsp for link
 JamiesonH#0334: Lol sick
 Streak#8889: can't even do like ryu inputs nvm terry's stuff
 Streak#8889: inputs are too much
 Streak#8889: but i'm a simple lad
 Streak#8889: I never actually got the DLC so i've never played terry tbf
 Streak#8889: guess how i spent year 11
 Streak#8889: i have a pretty long bus journey to and from school
 Streak#8889: basically a smash god innit
 JamiesonH#0334: I used to play link he's cool
 JamiesonH#0334: I got a switch today but I got like 50 hours playing at my gf's house

 Streak#8889: my mans out here being intelligent wtf
 JamiesonH#0334: Terry
 Streak#8889: who'd you main?
 Streak#8889: Lmao
 JamiesonH#0334: Ahhh
 Taz#9211: nah we're doing mechanics not stats rn
 JamiesonH#0334: Have u done that in maths yet?
 JamiesonH#0334: We could do a hypothesis test on it lol
 Taz#9211: i wonder if computer scientists are more likely to be LGBT then
 Streak#8889: compsoc 2.0
 Streak#8889: Lmao
 JamiesonH#0334: Not everyone but like 1/3 to 1/2 maybe
 JamiesonH#0334: All the computer science people go prism already lol
 Streak#8889: rip sanity
 Streak#8889: ~~cough cough you can brainwash some year 13s to join too~~
 JamiesonH#0334: I'll tell u all how uni is next year lol
 Streak#8889: but yeah, since we're in y12 it's easiest to advertise to y12
 Taz#9211: there are a few y11/y10
 JamiesonH#0334: Are most here year 12?
 Taz#9211: my bad
 JamiesonH#0334: Woah
 Streak#8889: spoiler
 Taz#9211: ||year 12||
 JamiesonH#0334: 
 Taz#9211: yeah people spend way too much on roblox 😂
 JamiesonH#0334: Robloxxxxx money go crazy
 JamiesonH#0334: Sickc
 Taz#9211: yeah definitely not bad but could've been better, ik some other devs were making hundreds or thousands
 JamiesonH#0334: Not too bad
 Taz#9211: over a couple years
 Taz#9211: not much, i think i made about £80 in total for all the stuff i made
 JamiesonH#0334: Jake what year are u
 ByName#9795: Sounds like a hacked client
 ByName#9795: Sword reach
 JakeH#2364: 69 quid
 JakeH#2364: oh u had it partially expanded lol
 JamiesonH#0334: How much would they sell for
 JakeH#2364: 997
 Taz#9211: yeah this is the longest script i wrote
 Streak#8889: _897 lines left_
 Streak#8889: Lmfao
 Taz#9211: omd it's so awful how did i ever debug this
 Taz#9211: lemme see if i can find one
 Taz#9211: mhm
 JamiesonH#0334: Lua right?
 JamiesonH#0334: Lol sick
 Taz#9211: i used to sell scripts on roblox
 Streak#8889: 💰
 JamiesonH#0334: Not monetised coding yet but we move
 JamiesonH#0334: If it gets big I get moneeee
 JamiesonH#0334: Ye
 Taz#9211: cool, i hope it all goes well
 JamiesonH#0334: In January
 JamiesonH#0334: But it's going live January
 JamiesonH#0334: It's just a passion project rn
 JamiesonH#0334: No lol
 Taz#9211: did he get paid
 JamiesonH#0334: I just started recently
 JamiesonH#0334: Ben had been working in the server for ages
 JamiesonH#0334: Lmao
 JamiesonH#0334: Yep
 Taz#9211: yeah well it sounds relatively simple, not many places to go wrong
 JamiesonH#0334: It's like a couple hundred lines , nothing crazee
 JamiesonH#0334: It probs works haha
 JamiesonH#0334: I haven't tested it at all lol
 Taz#9211: that's egg
 Streak#8889: Tfw u need friends
 JamiesonH#0334: It's hard to test with just myself lol cos the gamemode isn't supposed to trigger until 5 people are online
 JamiesonH#0334: Yep!
 Taz#9211: are u gonna do it so it checks each player's position every 10ms or smth like that
 JamiesonH#0334: Fun to make , annoying to debug
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeeee
 Taz#9211: yh that defo sounds like it'd cause lag
 JamiesonH#0334: But imma change it lol
 JamiesonH#0334: Cos there's a playermoveevent that checks if the player is in the hill capture area each time they move
 JamiesonH#0334: King of the hill gamemode is the laggy one
 Taz#9211: lmao what were they meant to do
 Streak#8889: supercomputer to the rescue again
 JamiesonH#0334: Two*
 JamiesonH#0334: But I've only made one so far and I was told it would lag the server too much
 Taz#9211: mm i see
 JamiesonH#0334: Once u learn the basics u pick it up pretty easy
 Streak#8889: Mood
 JamiesonH#0334: Nah
 Taz#9211: are they hard to make?
 JamiesonH#0334: But I'm still new to it
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah
 Taz#9211: i assume you code mc plugins in java?
 Taz#9211: ohh nice
 JamiesonH#0334: Ben does more for it than me
 JamiesonH#0334: Making plugins
 JamiesonH#0334: I *technically* work for as a developer on a Minecraft server lol
 JamiesonH#0334: No
 JamiesonH#0334: So dub fornu
 Streak#8889: did you manage to get like work experience and all over lockdown?
 JamiesonH#0334: Stuff like doing computing society is good too
 JamiesonH#0334: Otherwise you'll just have to waffle lol and it'll be shit
 JamiesonH#0334: You'll thank urslef for it so much when u write personal statement
 Streak#8889: high quality advice
 JamiesonH#0334: You guys all should make sure ur doing ur own big projects and reading books about computing
 Streak#8889: the grind 😤
 JamiesonH#0334: I just been working on beefing up the personal statement Uno
 JamiesonH#0334: Idk yet
 Streak#8889: which half is the annoying half?
 JamiesonH#0334: Half computing half maths
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah
 Streak#8889: like one of those weird aptitude tests?
 JamiesonH#0334: There's an online problem solving test for it soon
 JamiesonH#0334: Even qualifying for the interview ain't easy
 Streak#8889: imperial just hits different ig 😔
 Streak#8889: yikes
 Streak#8889: or is it just the exam and you're through
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah
 Streak#8889: does imperial do like interviews and all as well?
 JamiesonH#0334: But also fourth best paying degree in average in UK lol
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah
 Streak#8889: perhaps a little on the difficult end
 Streak#8889: hmmm
 JamiesonH#0334: 5% application success rate for imperial comsci
 Streak#8889: j e s u s
 JamiesonH#0334: No one passed it last year lol apparently
 Streak#8889: pain
 Streak#8889: 👀
 JamiesonH#0334: But it's still hard af
 JamiesonH#0334: They do
 Streak#8889: pity
 Streak#8889: does kegs not teach step?
 JamiesonH#0334: Have to learn AS further in my own time
 Streak#8889: good luck lol
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah it's in like 6 months for me
 JamiesonH#0334: I don't even do further maths so it's hard
 Streak#8889: pls
 Streak#8889: i have a year of sanity
 Streak#8889: that's in like year 13 tho right
 Streak#8889: hype
 Streak#8889: maths trauma
 JamiesonH#0334: Which is super hard
 JamiesonH#0334: 2
 JamiesonH#0334: Step
 JamiesonH#0334: Yep , don't remind me ;-;
 Streak#8889: Don't you have to do a couple extra exams as well
 Streak#8889: was hoping to apply there as well
 Streak#8889: that's fun
 Streak#8889: oooh
 JamiesonH#0334: Imperial London
 Streak#8889: which one?
 JamiesonH#0334: The uni I wanna go has 3 supercomputers so yeah 😎
 ByName#9795: It goes to English, it's all ASCII
 Streak#8889: ez
 Streak#8889: if it was running on a supercomputer it'd be instant and that's all that matters
 Streak#8889: blame it on the hardware
 JamiesonH#0334: Not instantly nvm lol it takes like 6 second s
 JamiesonH#0334: Quicker than Mr Johnson's website too  😎
 Streak#8889: hit em with the non english text
 JamiesonH#0334: But using my genetic algorithm u can solve it instantly
 JamiesonH#0334: I'm dumb , ur right
 JamiesonH#0334: 25 factorial
 JamiesonH#0334: Oh wait
 JamiesonH#0334: Much more effective than that lol
 ByName#9795: Decrypt this for fun
 Bedrockbreak49#4934: Than ceasar
 Bedrockbreak49#4934: Isn't substitution cipher up to 25! times more effective?
 JamiesonH#0334: U had to use the crib to figure out the key by hand and then decrypt
 ByName#9795: I have a cipher for you to break if you want
 JamiesonH#0334: But the one from one year ago was much harder
 Streak#8889: wtf is reading the ciphertext
 Streak#8889: year 10 me in shambles
 JamiesonH#0334: I just found it a bit easy cos u could see every 26th word was English lol
 Streak#8889: 👀
 JamiesonH#0334: Oh 🤣
 JamiesonH#0334: But the number changed constantly and every 26th word was English
 Streak#8889: That's the one I remember
 Streak#8889: yeah!
 JamiesonH#0334: It was literally a Caesar cipher except each word was shifted by a different number
 JamiesonH#0334: I think.....
 JamiesonH#0334: 2020 SE
 JamiesonH#0334: It was the special edition they did over the first lockdown so u might not be able to find it
 ByName#9795: Cadia!
 JamiesonH#0334: Cadia staff 😎😎😎
 JamiesonH#0334: Hehe
 ByName#9795: what about your other not quite hired employment
 Streak#8889: watch it be the one i'm talking about 😬
 Streak#8889: lemme pull up the archive
 Streak#8889: what was it two years ago?
 JamiesonH#0334: Super ez lol
 JamiesonH#0334: When I did it two years ago it was shit last challenge
 Streak#8889: that was so much fun
 Streak#8889: Honestly yeah
 Streak#8889: phone ide poggers
 JamiesonH#0334: Fun challanege
 JamiesonH#0334: That cipher was so good
 Streak#8889: Lmao
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah I remember coding it under the table in maths on my phone lol
 Streak#8889: Absolutely popped off when it worked
 Streak#8889: Like the last challenge last year iirc? I remember making that program
 Streak#8889: if we needed something custom we'd divvy it up or something
 Streak#8889: if there was a convenient website version we'd use that
 JamiesonH#0334: Then
 JamiesonH#0334: Did tarran do the coding the.
 Streak#8889: Like researching things which seemed off
 Streak#8889: i spent more time analysing than coding though
 Streak#8889: er i gotta try and remember the challenges
 JamiesonH#0334: Shrey what did u code in last year for cipher challenge
 ToastyPencil#2373: Thanks
 ron0studios#4591:  the powerpoint is on  if you want to check it out
 ron0studios#4591:
 JamiesonH#0334:
 JamiesonH#0334: Nothing server side 😡
 ToastyPencil#2373:
 JamiesonH#0334: Only allows html CSS and js basically
 JamiesonH#0334: The code sucks cos neocities sucks
 ron0studios#4591: we should do thursday i think then
 ron0studios#4591: I heard from someone else that Young engineer afterschool sessions are also on wednesday
 Streak#8889: fancy
 JamiesonH#0334: And I did
 JamiesonH#0334: But he wanted me to add music streaming radio thing to his website
 JamiesonH#0334: That's how I got in touch with him
 JamiesonH#0334: I didn't mind cos Im a fan of his music
 Streak#8889: rip
 JamiesonH#0334: But he didn't pay
 JamiesonH#0334: I mean I made his site for him so I guess he technically hired me
 Streak#8889: Lol
 JamiesonH#0334: Maybe hired is a strong word lol but I did some work for a musician
 Streak#8889: dang you got hired by someone?
 JamiesonH#0334: Just cos a guy who hired me used it to host his site so I had to lol
 JamiesonH#0334: I use neocities too but that's not as good
 ron0studios#4591: thats the best part
 ron0studios#4591: yh
 JamiesonH#0334: Cos it runs right off GitHub right?
 JamiesonH#0334: It's pretty good tho
 JamiesonH#0334: Haha my mate set it up
 ron0studios#4591: its awesome
 ron0studios#4591: ive been using it for around 4-5 years now
 ron0studios#4591: yess lesgo netlify
 JamiesonH#0334: Gotta plug the site
 JamiesonH#0334: cncm.netlify.app in development
 JamiesonH#0334: I've got code that solves all the basic ciphers instantly rn and the other kegs groups probs do too
 Streak#8889: idt there is one
 Taz#9211: 5 or 6?
 JamiesonH#0334: Idk
 JamiesonH#0334: Three*
 ron0studios#4591: whats the max team size?
 JamiesonH#0334: I did it on my own now team of two
 ron0studios#4591: ok
 JamiesonH#0334: National
 Taz#9211: there are independent groups as well
 ron0studios#4591: like national or regional?
 Taz#9211: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 JamiesonH#0334: I came like 50th
 ron0studios#4591: how many schools?
 Taz#9211: but we arent the speediest for sure
 Taz#9211: as for how well we place im not sure
 ron0studios#4591: oh ok
 Taz#9211: we usually get to the end
 JamiesonH#0334: Like 2 years ago
 JamiesonH#0334: I came joint first doing it on my own
 ron0studios#4591: as in how far do we usually go
 ron0studios#4591: does kegs do any good in this contest?
 ron0studios#4591: ah i see
 JamiesonH#0334: Just learn the basic ciphers and then the final round which is the one that most matters is basically whoever can figure it out quickest
 ron0studios#4591: aright
 Taz#9211: it's mostly a different field
 Taz#9211: uhh probably a bit but not that much
 JamiesonH#0334: Not really
 ron0studios#4591: like trees and graphs
 ron0studios#4591: yeah
 ron0studios#4591: data structures
 Taz#9211: data structures?
 Taz#9211: what is DS
 Taz#9211: ciphers are interesting but i dont think i'll ever understand mr johnson's endless enthusiasm for them
 ron0studios#4591: Does algorithms and DS knowledge help?
 JamiesonH#0334: At least until the last couple weeks
 JamiesonH#0334: It's pretty easy tbh
 ron0studios#4591: but im not that good with ciphers
 JamiesonH#0334: Make sure to sign up soon
 ron0studios#4591: with a few friends
 ron0studios#4591: ill do it in a team
 JamiesonH#0334: Are u doing cipher challenge
 ron0studios#4591: there'll probably only be 5 or so ppl competing anyways
 ron0studios#4591: so theres not much to do
 ron0studios#4591: its only a one time event anyways
 ByName#9795: idk how long the admin for it is
 ByName#9795: Certain things need a teacher - admin yes
 ron0studios#4591: only for the beginning and end
 Taz#9211: we can't organise it ourselves because we can't do the admin stuff of contacting the BIO and arranging for tests and stuff
 ron0studios#4591: Not necessarily
 JamiesonH#0334: Do u need a teacher ?
 Taz#9211: either way it's pointless if mr sims doesn't have the time to organise it
 ron0studios#4591: ok
 ron0studios#4591: oh
 ron0studios#4591: afternoon?
 ByName#9795: Hmm yes - I wouldn't be able to do any after school stuff other than helping set up though
 Taz#9211: i have a small feeling an afternoon session will not be very attractive
 ron0studios#4591: or maybe even some yr 9s
 ron0studios#4591: we could run it for yr10 and up
 ron0studios#4591: so having an afterschool session on wednesdays in cpr3 is what we're going for then?
 ron0studios#4591: ok
 ron0studios#4591: oh yh
 ByName#9795: covid
 ron0studios#4591: why were they not allowed?
 JamiesonH#0334: Hopefully more now other years are aloowed
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah
 ron0studios#4591: bigger than most clubs
 ron0studios#4591: pretty decent numbers
 JamiesonH#0334: 15-20
 ron0studios#4591: just curious
 ron0studios#4591: does alison craig greene (or sam craig greene) go to the club?
 ByName#9795: Yes, I can talk to him about doing it as a coding/computing club related thing
 ron0studios#4591: we could probably convince him that we could run something
 ron0studios#4591: but now that he's pretty much letting us under the wheel
 Taz#9211: how many members do u get weekly on avg
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah
 Taz#9211: mums?
 JamiesonH#0334: Make out n be gay
 ByName#9795: In the past Mr Sims has said that we don't do BIO anymore as he doesn't have time to organise it
 ron0studios#4591: but what do you all do there?
 ron0studios#4591: oh rite
 JamiesonH#0334: Prism is LGBTQ club not competitions lol
 ron0studios#4591: CS can be a very mathematical subject
 ron0studios#4591: I think that practice for the BIO would be very interesting for those who like maths IMO
 JakeH#2364: F# unironically da best
 ron0studios#4591: yh
 JamiesonH#0334: Plus prism and two  courseworks lol
 JamiesonH#0334: I've just already got a lot of projects as well as being in year 13 so I get quite busy
 ron0studios#4591: yh
 JamiesonH#0334: Wednesday
 JamiesonH#0334: I'd probs go
 JamiesonH#0334: Hmmm
 ron0studios#4591: wednesday afterschool?
 JamiesonH#0334: As long as it's not friday I would go probs
 ron0studios#4591: most ppl who'd want to participate would atleast be able to allocate an afterschool session
 ron0studios#4591: After school makes sense
 JamiesonH#0334: Unless it's like after school
 JamiesonH#0334: I'm way too busy for that lol
 ron0studios#4591: or dynamic programming
 JamiesonH#0334: He taught me f# lol
 ron0studios#4591: i am free to give some powerpoints on graph algorithms
 JakeH#2364: Mr Johnson automatically loves you
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah
 Taz#9211: running in-person training camps may be a bit much, imo it'd be a better plan to just have a support teams or smth like that
 ron0studios#4591: while ppl are doing cipher challenge
 ron0studios#4591: during the cypher challenge?
 JamiesonH#0334: When tho
 ron0studios#4591: I know a fair bit of algorithms so i might be able to help
 ron0studios#4591: and we could run training camps or something
 ron0studios#4591: so we could just ask him for permission
 ron0studios#4591: I mean he's literally letting us take the wheel
 JamiesonH#0334: I've done a bit
 Taz#9211: we could do smth like a petition
 ron0studios#4591: few weeks ago
 ron0studios#4591: but if he's just letting us do our own thing....
 JamiesonH#0334: Lol how long ago did u ask
 JakeH#2364: F# ppl where u at
 ron0studios#4591: im pretty sure he's forgotten
 ron0studios#4591: i asked mr sims afterschool. He just said he'll consider it
 ron0studios#4591: i mean who's main programming language is anything other than that
 JamiesonH#0334: Do u wanna email Sims or Johnson 
 Taz#9211: yeah makes sense, pretty much everyone knows at least one of those
 ron0studios#4591: it doesnt happen often
 ron0studios#4591: it would be really fun to represent KEGS in compsci though
 JamiesonH#0334: Hmmm
 ron0studios#4591: bcs those are the ones allowed in the IOI
 ron0studios#4591: i think the accepted languages are python, js, c/c++ and java
 Taz#9211: 😂
 ron0studios#4591: malbolge time
 ron0studios#4591: lol
 Taz#9211: omw to use brainfuck
 JamiesonH#0334: Sick
 ron0studios#4591: ANY
 JamiesonH#0334: What language?
 ron0studios#4591: There are written parts in the finals though
 Taz#9211: oh ic, so it's not a pen/paper test
 JamiesonH#0334: Oh that's good
 ron0studios#4591: you're given an input
 ron0studios#4591: you have to write actual code
 Taz#9211: and then u gotta write some pseudocode to solve it
 ron0studios#4591: and some DS and implementation
 ron0studios#4591: all algorithmic questions
 Taz#9211: does it like give u a problem
 ron0studios#4591: but it would be fun to try. A kegs student got into the finals in 2016 and 2005 and some other year i think
 Taz#9211: what are the questions?
 JamiesonH#0334: Okay :0
 ron0studios#4591: which is harder than you think
 ron0studios#4591: the pass mark for the round 2 finals is 70/100.
 ron0studios#4591: its usually the 3rd one
 ron0studios#4591: since the first 2 are mostly implementation questions
 ron0studios#4591: if you get a hang of a few past paper questions it slowly becomes quite easy
 JamiesonH#0334: Looks pretty hard
 JamiesonH#0334: Oh yeah I did some past papers for that lol
 ron0studios#4591: we could run training sessions for 6th formers and some yr10-11s
 ron0studios#4591: so loads of IOI style algorithms questions
 ron0studios#4591: and its basically the UK's way of picking the teams for the international olympiad in informatics
 ron0studios#4591: or december
 ron0studios#4591: its on november
 JamiesonH#0334: And what time of year is it do u know
 JamiesonH#0334: What sort of thing do u do
 ron0studios#4591: but its a really fun competition and literally every other school does it
 ron0studios#4591: we used to do it for the last few years but we stopped bcs of lack of support
 ron0studios#4591: You guys should ask mr sims to run the british informatics olympiad this year
 JakeH#2364: exactly
 Streak#8889: a not small amount of spageti could fit in a piano
 Streak#8889: not wrong tbf
 Streak#8889: blink twice if you're going insane
 JakeH#2364: but imagine the sheer mass of spaghet
 Professor Chaos#9143: Hmmm
 JakeH#2364: yes
 Streak#8889: you ok jake
 Streak#8889: Wtf is this
 Professor Chaos#9143:
 Bedrockbreak49#4934:
 Stef#4362: Yh
 Streak#8889: ❗
 Wide_Cat#6112:
 ron0studios#4591: are you stefan from yr11?
 Stef#4362: Hello
 JamiesonH#0334: Hello stef
 JamiesonH#0334:
 Stef#4362:
 JamiesonH#0334: Yeah it is haha
 Streak#8889: that makes it all right then
 Streak#8889: ah it's love with like a scandinavian accent or something
 Streak#8889: not a suspicious name at all
 JamiesonH#0334: With love2d engine
 JamiesonH#0334: I'm doing it for my nea lol
 Streak#8889: op pls nerf
 Taz#9211: i have fond memories of lua
 JamiesonH#0334: I'm the lua goat
 Streak#8889: now we don't have like 30 year 7s tryna flex their like lua skills
 Streak#8889: da discord server hits different
 Streak#8889: 😬
 ByName#9795: Why can't we have this sort of responsiveness and enthusiasm for coding club.....
 Streak#8889: mad speed
 Streak#8889: been like five hours since school ended and there's already two genetic algorithm posts
 ByName#9795: It's some JPMC thing that they open sourced
 JamiesonH#0334: Cool thanks
 ByName#9795: There's something called perspective that if I recall correctly lets you plot graphs
 JamiesonH#0334: i made this in like an hour before i knew what a genetic algorithm was properly so its a bit sloppy
 JamiesonH#0334: thankssss
 ron0studios#4591: well good luck on your project then!
 ron0studios#4591: should be
 JamiesonH#0334: but im sure theres something similar tbh
 ron0studios#4591: oof
 JamiesonH#0334: im using javascript tho ;-;
 ron0studios#4591: you can start by just inputting an array of values i think
 ron0studios#4591: there's a lot of customization with it
 ron0studios#4591: pyplot
 ron0studios#4591: matplotlib
 JamiesonH#0334: I wanna make a frequency analysis bar chart for my cipher website but have no idea how
 JamiesonH#0334: What do u make the graphs with
 JamiesonH#0334: I think that's what it's called
 JamiesonH#0334: I was watching a video about hapsack just earlier lol
 ron0studios#4591: oh thats neat!
 ron0studios#4591: i like graphs...
 JamiesonH#0334: My substitution genetic algorithm used like 30 generations
 ron0studios#4591: lets see what happens if i increase it
 ron0studios#4591: to be fair there were only 10 items
 ron0studios#4591: looks like it only needed around 20
 ron0studios#4591: over 100 generations
 JamiesonH#0334: That's so degen
 ByName#9795: Might also make a version with multiples
 ByName#9795: Unless it's greater than 5 or less than 3
 ByName#9795: The number of prime factors is the base
 JamiesonH#0334: Jesus lol
 ByName#9795: Base 3 up to base 5
 ByName#9795: That's ir
 ByName#9795: It does prime factor decomposition then uses that to generate a base, converts unicode to numbers then those to numbers in the new base then back into unicode
 JamiesonH#0334: Haha okay
 ByName#9795: If I explain how it works try to decode it and then we can get Alex to solve it
 JamiesonH#0334: Oh god
 ByName#9795: Mine is similar
 JamiesonH#0334: Like Alex's was just a long list of stupid things like converting it to base 4 and putting it into Morse code lol
 ByName#9795: Yes
 JamiesonH#0334: Is the cipher just a bunch of weird steps
 ByName#9795: Theoretically at least
 JamiesonH#0334: Hmmm
 ByName#9795: I think it's reversible
 ByName#9795: I've sent you the cipher text now
 JamiesonH#0334: Good
 JamiesonH#0334: That's not food
 JamiesonH#0334: Oh
 ByName#9795: It had an infinite loop
 ByName#9795: Python
 JamiesonH#0334: What are u coding it in
 JamiesonH#0334: Oof
 ByName#9795: so far my cipher is breaking my computer
 JamiesonH#0334: It's a bit shit tho
 JamiesonH#0334: I can send my code if u want shrey
 JamiesonH#0334: No that's a substitution cipher
 ByName#9795: Is that Alex's cipher?
 JamiesonH#0334: On cncm.netlify.app just input to the top box and press substitution cipher button

 ByName#9795: I might make my own version
 JamiesonH#0334: Oh I did , it works , just very slowly on mobile
 JamiesonH#0334: Also can't remember if I pushed the changes lol
 JamiesonH#0334: And I don't have my laptop rn
 JamiesonH#0334: I do but it's too long to send lol
 JamiesonH#0334: One sec
 JamiesonH#0334: Hmm
 ByName#9795: do you have some cipher text>
 ByName#9795: In what way?
 JamiesonH#0334: No it doesn't work lol
 Streak#8889: Lmao
 JamiesonH#0334: He made a really stupid cipher cos he's never done any of it before
 ByName#9795: You solved it?
 JamiesonH#0334: He's in our year
 JamiesonH#0334: Alex's cipher is so stupid
 Streak#8889: alex?
 JamiesonH#0334: cncm.netlify.app
 ByName#9795: have you tested it against Alex's cipher?
 Streak#8889: Quick portfolio flex lets go
 JamiesonH#0334: It's on my website if u want
 JamiesonH#0334: JavaScript is so quick :0
 Streak#8889: do you have a link or like video of it working? sounds cool
 JamiesonH#0334: Dw bout that
 Streak#8889: power move
 JamiesonH#0334: But it's worked on all the substitution ciphers I've tested in 3 seconds ish
 Streak#8889: should i post the script I was going off as well? I think I put the important bits on the slides but might as well help
 JamiesonH#0334: My version works now but it's very basic
 ByName#9795: Yes, we haven't formally launched yet for this year - i still have to do writing and graphic design
 JamiesonH#0334: Thanksssss
 Streak#8889: convenient timing
 Streak#8889: ah
 Streak#8889: if you're burning to see the rest of the presentation, the slides are in 
 JamiesonH#0334: Would you mind sending the slides cos I was quite disappointed I had too miss it lol
 Streak#8889: pretty good honestly
 Streak#8889: we'll see
 Streak#8889: it's just an idea atm maybe it'll become something
 Streak#8889: we'll coordinate with coding club probs idk
 Streak#8889: Yeah we were planning to do that as term finales lol
 JamiesonH#0334: Howd it go today
 Streak#8889: er ig your username already has a nickname
 ByName#9795: Also should we run 'house hackathon' - might be an excuse to get people off timetable
 Streak#8889: hey jamie
 Streak#8889: i said 12:50 😬
 JamiesonH#0334: Hello
 Taz#9211: nah entirely my fault you said it was 12:35 pretty clearly lol
 Streak#8889: 💀 💀
 JamiesonH#0334:
 Streak#8889: slight miscommunication
 Taz#9211: it's been a long day allow it
 ByName#9795: That's 10-15 times more than informatics society last year
 Streak#8889: Lmao
 nxjain#3063: ah
 Taz#9211: i was getting lunch and also i thought it started at 1
 nxjain#3063: 😂😂 literally
 Streak#8889: Bro  did you forget your own club lol how were you  late
 ByName#9795: {x:10<x<15}
 nxjain#3063: most came at like 1-1:10 ish
 Streak#8889: an inequality if you will
 Streak#8889: a range is probs better
 Streak#8889: yeah
 nxjain#3063: 10-15
 Streak#8889: 12 maybe?
 Streak#8889: like
 Streak#8889: Er
 Streak#8889: i'm just introducing then
 Streak#8889: The first bits are usually more irrelevant than the last bits anyways
 ByName#9795: How many people did you have today?
 nxjain#3063: dw 😂 it's defo better if you do it at 1:05
 nxjain#3063: nah no one else does
 Streak#8889: idk if others go to riverside as well but better safe n sorry
 Streak#8889: what time do you leave?
 Streak#8889: so there should still be time
 Streak#8889: eh I mean Project: Search next week is a little shorter, iirc
 nxjain#3063: kinda ye
 Streak#8889: oh do you have to leave early for that
 nxjain#3063: its chill I can just check the slides after
 nxjain#3063: I have to walk to riverside for games
 Streak#8889: oh why
 nxjain#3063: I'll have to leave early then noice
 Streak#8889: as opposed to ending after section 4
 nxjain#3063: oh
 Streak#8889: that's the idea
 nxjain#3063: and end at the end of lunch?
 Streak#8889: Before then we'll just talk about last week, anything interesting like cipher challenge, w/e
 Streak#8889: Yeah I think I'll start at 1:05ish then
 Streak#8889: you're a good influence on me
 ByName#9795: The other lunch break starts at 13:05
 Streak#8889: look
 Streak#8889: i mean
 Streak#8889: ew nehal i'm talking like you
 Streak#8889: safe
 Streak#8889: 10-15ish minutes later
 Streak#8889: aight so we can safely start like
 nxjain#3063: around that mark ye
 ron0studios#4591: maybe 15?
 ron0studios#4591: i think so
 ron0studios#4591: yh
 ron0studios#4591: um
 nxjain#3063: 20 past??
 Streak#8889: Ayo    do you guys remember what time we finished today?
 Streak#8889: nice
 ByName#9795: I've invited him now
 ByName#9795: Depends, I think I can always make the first 15 minutes, after that less sure
 Streak#8889: can you make compsocs on wednesday btw?
 Streak#8889: though he also said some stuff about it maybe being on thursdays, so hype if he can come too
 Streak#8889: he left since he heads prism i think?
 Streak#8889: Yeah iirc
 ByName#9795: Jamie?
 Streak#8889: and @anyone else, if you know someone, just send them an invite for this server
 Streak#8889: i don't suppose they have?
 Streak#8889: someone said they'd ask for the discord invite off you
 Streak#8889: oh yeah ben
 ByName#9795: wouldnt get this on the coding club team!
 Streak#8889: ms teams could never
 Streak#8889: high quality conversation innit
 nxjain#3063: love the professionalism in this chat uno 😂
 JakeH#2364: Shh
 Streak#8889: 👁️ 👁️
 Streak#8889: just cuz you can't see  doesn't mean it isn't watching
 JakeH#2364: Love you so much 💖
 Streak#8889: youre literally capping
 JakeH#2364: Say if you have 4 really good keys
 Streak#8889: hush jake
 Streak#8889: kinda  but wdym how many parents? As in how many parents are involved in creating two children, or how many parents are initialised to start off the algorithm?
 JakeH#2364: It is of course possible to start with more than 2 parents
 JakeH#2364: So depends how many children are derived from each pair of parents
 JakeH#2364: Then each child is paired with another
 JakeH#2364: For the start
 JakeH#2364: 2
 ron0studios#4591: I missed the first half of the presentation, how many parents do you pick per generation?
 JakeH#2364: 😂
 Streak#8889: Jake hallworth you should be knighted by the queen
 JakeH#2364: What à fine gentleman you are shrey
 JakeH#2364: Absolutely
 nxjain#3063: cool
 nxjain#3063: wait did it change
 Streak#8889: 100% agreed, that's just common sense
 JakeH#2364: All genders should be treated equally
 nxjain#3063: oh whoops my bad
 JakeH#2364: 😂
 Streak#8889: medsoc who
 Streak#8889: rival clubs
 Streak#8889: intimidate our enemies
 Streak#8889: jake's the compsoc bouncer
 JakeH#2364: I am the nickname police
 Streak#8889: Smh read 
 Streak#8889: rule 1
 JakeH#2364: Telling him to change his nickname
 nxjain#3063: why
 Streak#8889: ^
 JakeH#2364: U need to change ur nickname
 Streak#8889: tell me how you came to this imaginative conclusion
 Streak#8889: Insightful analysis from jake himself
 nxjain#3063: uh ye
 ByName#9795: Coding Club is still on Teams. I presume anyone in Yr 10 and above would prefer to use this though as Teams isn't the best - I would move CC to Discord but can't because it's a school thing. When do you want to start your algorithms part of Coding Club?
 JakeH#2364: Nehal is that u?
 nxjain#3063:
 ron0studios#4591: i hope it works
 ron0studios#4591: lol
 Streak#8889: fingers crossed it actually works 👀
 ron0studios#4591: so i thought that doing it "genetically" might be fun
 ron0studios#4591: except without repeating combinations
 ron0studios#4591: i.e going through the combinations
 ron0studios#4591: there is a dynamic programming solution which is very popular, but its basically a complicated way of just doing the same thing
 ron0studios#4591: when greater than 50
 ron0studios#4591: going through all combinations are very difficult
 Streak#8889: like is the algorithm able to just divide the value by the weight or something
 Streak#8889: on cheesing it
 Streak#8889: restrictive are you
 Streak#8889: how like
 Streak#8889: i see
 ron0studios#4591: thats basically the problem
 ron0studios#4591: try and fill up the knapsack with the greatest value, without overfilling it
 ron0studios#4591: but it has a certain Maximum weight
 ron0studios#4591: You have a knapsack
 ron0studios#4591: some of the items have a greater *value* than the others, but may be heavier or lighter
 ron0studios#4591: basically you have a list of different items that have a different weight each
 ron0studios#4591: so
 ron0studios#4591: one sec
 Streak#8889: what's the knapsack problem
 Streak#8889: and that is..?
 ron0studios#4591: im currently writing a genetic algorithm for the knapsack problem
 ron0studios#4591: that seems best
 ron0studios#4591: yh
 ron0studios#4591: tbf it would just be people saying thanks or that the link is broken
 Streak#8889: nah i'll just restrict typing perms
 ron0studios#4591: yh
 ron0studios#4591: as in the admin only messages
 Streak#8889: idk if there's the need it's only one post
 Streak#8889: worst case i'll just sc a pic
 ron0studios#4591: you could make them into threads perhaps
 Streak#8889: hmm
 ron0studios#4591: lol
 ron0studios#4591: it
 ron0studios#4591: microsoft probably wouldnt allow
 Streak#8889: oops
 Streak#8889: oh er that shouldn't be typable
 Streak#8889: pity it didn't embed
 ron0studios#4591: thank you!
 ron0studios#4591: ok then
 Streak#8889: I'll make a #archive in a few minutes and put em there
 Streak#8889: We'll start later next week
 ron0studios#4591: Could you upload your presentation to ?
 ron0studios#4591: For us in yr 11, we managed to atleast get half of the presentation in XD
 ron0studios#4591: lol
 Streak#8889: ~~though I didn't have enough notices for year 10 today~~
 ron0studios#4591: aight
 ron0studios#4591: aigfht
 Streak#8889: Yeah
 ron0studios#4591: so this club is yr10 onwards?
 Streak#8889: Idk how the Teams is, iirc it's just a ton of year 7s though
 Streak#8889: We'll probs collab with them a bit
 ron0studios#4591: oh right
 Streak#8889: Coding clubs separate to compsoc
 ron0studios#4591: Is the codingclub teams essentially going to be inactive from now on?
 ron0studios#4591: Alright thanks!
 Streak#8889: let us know and we'll see if there's a free week
 Streak#8889: There's a bit of a waiting list but we definitely would love if you guys gave presentations as well
 Streak#8889: nice
 ron0studios#4591: Is there already a waiting list for presentations or are we free to give one if we ask before-hand?
 ron0studios#4591: that should do it
 ron0studios#4591: sure
 ron0studios#4591: oh yeah
 Streak#8889: Or at least include it
 Streak#8889: Can you change your nickname to your real name though
 Streak#8889: Lol np
 ron0studios#4591: I haven't used discord in a while forgive me for messing up once in a while lol
 Streak#8889: the more you know
 ron0studios#4591: didnt know that feature existed
 ron0studios#4591:
 ron0studios#4591:
 ByName#9795: Expecting a presentation on sus fps at some point now
 Taz#9211: i dont think god can forgive that joke
 Streak#8889: god help me
 Taz#9211: it sucks that u gotta wake up that early
 Taz#9211: ah fair enough
 JakeH#2364: That's actually a good idea I can't lie
 Streak#8889: year 13s really do be responsible
 ByName#9795: No, just a sleep schedule I try to stick to so I actually get enough sleep. I have to be awake at about 6:20 so normally try to be asleep in time to get 8ish hours
 Taz#9211: do you have a strict bedtime or smth?
 Streak#8889: aight np
 ByName#9795: Just saw your email
 ByName#9795: Yes, technically I shouldn't be awake so won't actually do anything until tomorrow
 Streak#8889: well that was quicker than i expected
 ByName#9795:
 Streak#8889: already know it all
 Streak#8889: you're too smart innit
 JakeH#2364: He said just copy someone's notes to my area
 JakeH#2364: Sir says I don't need to
 JakeH#2364: Cheers
 Streak#8889: i glossed over some parts
 Streak#8889: would recommend watching mr sims' powerpoint
 Streak#8889: Ello enry
